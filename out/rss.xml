  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bahn, the fully state-owned railway company, is a well-liked company running most major long-distance railways in Germany. So, it will come as a surprise to many that I have some complaints about them. Today, however, I won’t talk about the numerous delays, cancellations and frankly bad service interactions I had with them in the past. Today is about dark patterns that cost me 500€ for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I apologise in advance for using mostly German material, as it is the primary language. I thought it wasimportant to use it. Also, DB manages to make the English part even worse by breaking their reference to additional material (see header image). Also, if your sarcasm detector is broken, you might have trouble with some sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A dark pattern is a design mechanism to get people to buy, do or allow things they don’t actually want. Examples include: Forced continuity of free trials with paid subscriptions, hiding the true costs of a service, and many, many more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are especially prevalent with subscriptions, so it might not come as a surprise that we will look at subscriptions today. At first, let’s look at two other well-liked and respected companies: Adobe and Deutsche Telekom. Both make use of subscriptions: One for an ongoing connection to the internet and one for software. This is how they are advertised on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both note prices in Currency Per Timeframe: €/month or €/year. Telekom even includes some discounts: 9.95€/month and in smaller font: 43.95€/month starting with the 4th month! Adobe clearly states they are selling a monthly subscription (“Monats-Abo”) or a yearly subscription, but paid monthly. There is no misunderstanding. (Note: Adobe is highly criticised for its subscription practices.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on these examples, let’s see how Deutsche Bahn advertises their BahnCards. A BahnCard is a discount offer; it is not a product or service in itself, but rather allows you to get discounts. They exist on various levels: Normal and Business, 25/50/100, Probe or Normal, first or second class. I’ll limit this to the first class BahnCard 50, as that’s the one I got and the Probe version, which is only valid for 3-month period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Bahncard 50 gives you a 50% discount on regular fares (which are rarely paid by most casual users) and a 25% discount on discounted tickets. After using it for a year, I’d say it is a very bad deal for most casual travellers, but that’s beside the point. I bought mine on sale (50% off), but those are not available at the time of screenshotting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “weitere Informationen” link lets us see additional details about this order and an FAQ section with important information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It even contains a neat question about the cost of the BahnCard 50! That’s nice. 492 Euro for the first-class card. We knew that, it was clearly advertised! Silly. We can even link to this section specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So: Is this a subscription? Yes, of course it is! The Probe Bahncard page actually mentions this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as the sales process, once you hit “jetzt bestellen” (buy now).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, it is the text in the centre of the screen, you won’t see the word “Abonnement” again. I used a fake account to generate some screenshots of the current sales process, but Deutsche Bahn changes it around every now and then, so neither can I be sure it looked like this when I bought my Bahncard, nor is it guaranteed to look like this when you go through the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have some objections to the layout of this page. In my opinion, this text is designed to make people not take notice of the subscription. No mention of the timeframe or recurrent nature of the price. For completion: The probe Bahncard screen does not mention the price of the full Bahncard (492€) at all, only the probe price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s head on to the final sales screen; the intermediate screens only take in the user information and provide no additional information on the Bahncard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is zero indication of the payments (the value of 492) being recurrent (“492.00€/year”); the probe version does not contain the price of the full Bahncard at all. The mention of the subscription does not use the word “Abonnement” (subscription) this time, instead says that it gets automatically extended by one year unless you cancel. It has no visual weight, unlike the “bahnde-Newsletter” abonnement (so if you ctrl+f “abo” you’ll end up in that section), and there is no option to not get the Bahncard as a non-subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You buy the Bahncard and receive a confirmation email for your subscription. Although it does not contain the word Abonnement, any mention of renewal, the price of the subscription (only the reduced price of the sale in my case) or any indication of cancellation. You also receive a welcome email, letting you know about the advantages of your Bahncard, which, again, contains no information about cancellation, renewal, subscription, or prices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;You Now Have A Subscripton. How Can You Tell?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you bought a Bahncard subscription. You used it for a while and decided it is not worth the cost. You don’t remember getting a subscription, but you want to make sure! Unfortunately, you don’t try the obvious thing, but make the mistake of checking your actual account at Deutsche Bahn. So, where to search for the subscription?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bahn thought about that! They have a subscription portal called Aboportal. It is clearly labelled in the account menu, right next to the Bahncard option! Amazing. Here’s what it looks like for me right now:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had two subscriptions in the past for Deutschland-Tickets; they were cancelled long ago, and they still show up. They have a lot of space for additional menu items; it seems they don’t believe in separating functions or user-friendly design — that’s just my opinion. No Bahncard subscription, though. I would not fault you for believing you do not have a subscription active after this screen and just quitting, but let’s try more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it has to be in the Bahncard section. Here are two entries, one is my extended Bahncard I never wanted, and one is my Bahncard Business that, fortunately, my company provides. Can you tell if, and which, is a subscription?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s very obvious if you know what you need to look out for. If you hit the “options” selector, there will be a third entry saying “Cancel Subscription” for a subscription. Also, Bahncard Business is not available as a subscription, so it can’t be one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, when are you informed of the renewal? The cancellation time is 4 weeks before the end of validity. 21 days, or three weeks, before renewal, you will receive a notification for your new bahncard. It is too late now. You are stuck with it for another year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you cancel instantly anyway, you will receive an automated cancellation reply with the following neat sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ihrem Wunschtermin können wir leider nicht entsprechen, da eine Kündigung nur bis spätestens vier Wochen vor Ende der Laufzeit möglich ist. Dafür bitten wir um Verständnis.&lt;/p&gt;Automated DB Email for cancellation&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Translation: “Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate your requested date, as termination is only possible up to four weeks before the end of the term. We apologise for any inconvenience.” Deutsche Bahn has fully incorporated the subscription trap into the response. They are aware of it, they know you do not want it, and they let you know: They will not cancel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contacting Deutsche Bahn Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are remotely acquainted with German support standards, you can probably skip this section. Deutsche Bahn has no intention of providing any form of good support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you’ll have trouble finding a way to contact them, that is, not by phone (or in person). After some searching, you’ll find a contact form linked in some places that does not work. In the end, I managed to get a response from this email address: bahncard-service@bahn.de&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sent them a message about how I tried to figure out that I have a subscription recently and did not find anything, and how I never wanted this renewal, how I was never informed of the increased cost (as I bought it on sale). To prevent any misinformation about my email, here is the translated original:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, I purchased a Bahncard as part of a special offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A few weeks ago, I checked to see if I could find any information about a subscription, as I don’t want another Bahncard—I only needed it for one year.&lt;lb/&gt;I couldn’t find any information in my original confirmation email or on the website, and the subscription portal doesn’t list it either.&lt;p&gt;Today, I suddenly received a message saying that I will receive a new Bahncard in three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;I canceled it immediately online, but unfortunately I was told that it was too late and that I should have done so at least four weeks before the expiration date.&lt;lb/&gt;The only email with the words “subscription” and “Bahncard” is the new Bahncard email.&lt;lb/&gt;Furthermore, the email does not contain any information about any costs associated with the Bahncard.&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;Translation of my email to the support.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, I received a standardised response. You can find the translated version here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your email dated September 21, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all offers on www.bahn.de, the contract is only concluded at the end of the booking process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before completing your purchase, we will inform you about the terms and conditions for purchasing and using the BahnCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You acknowledged this directly during the online booking process and accepted it by clicking “Buy now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From October 1 to October 13, 2024, the BahnCard 50 was available at a discounted price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, the BahnCard will be converted into a regular subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We regret that you disagree with our decision to cancel your BahnCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BahnCard subscription can be canceled annually up to four weeks before the end of the validity period. The date of receipt of the cancellation by BahnCard Service is decisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ask for your understanding that we are sticking to our decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have still scheduled the cancellation of your BahnCard **** for **. **** 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translated with DeepL.com (free version)&lt;/p&gt;Translation of the support email.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another back and forth led to the same result. This problem is common enough that a lawyer put out a default letter template for refusing, which I used for my second letter. It comes up on Reddit frequently, although I do not understand the people who defend this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the previous attempts by Verbraucherschutz to sue Deutsche Bahn over this were unsuccessful. The layman’s summary I got from this court decision: As the Bahncard is a discount card and not a subscription to a product or service itself, it does not fall under the consumer protections that the Verbraucherschutz sued over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Deutsche Bahn: No Reputation To Lose&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Deutsche Bahn has no reputation they lose. The discourse is dominated by their terrible service, delays and cancellations. They have no incentive, as a company, to improve other sections like the Bahncard sales tactics. They, as a company, have nothing to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We as a society have a lot to lose. Deutsche Bahn is 100% owned by the state of Germany. We consumers do not cleanly separate companies from their owners. Many even think of Deutsche Bahn as a state company. Feeling cheated by your government is not good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, Deutsche Bahn is a core infrastructure company for more eco-friendly transportation. Driving people, like me, away from using the Bahn is bad in so many ways. I have a high desire for fairness; if I feel cheated, I’d rather take a higher loss to myself than support the person or company that cheated me. However, I have little recourse in this whole debacle, but I’d rather drive my car more, or even rent one, than use Deutsche Bahn… and I really like taking trains. I love being lazy while the landscapes fly by instead of focusing on the road and getting annoyed at other drivers. All this, despite not a single one of my ~20 train journeys the last year being on time, and a dozen of them not even honouring my reservations, being overrun or flat out cancelled. None of that made me quit taking the train. Feeling cheated by Deutsche Bahn sure does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post was written as anger management. This whole desaster of communcation, despite “only” being 500€, cost me so much productivity, motivation and more. I hate dealing with these kind of things. It followed me around all day, made me lose sleep, just because it annoyed me so much. Now I feel better. So for some fun: My first email to Deutsche Bahn netted me 8 recipient confirmation emails by deutsche Bahn, neatly spaced by around 3 hours each. Then they took 2 days to respond to my first email. For the second email I received only 1 confirmation, but got to wait 15 days for a response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the year, Dr. Terry Wagner’s office manager came to him and said “something weird is going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For weeks, the office manager told him, Wagner had been quietly underpaid by the insurance company Aetna on a seemingly random selection of higher level claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s blatantly disrespectful,” said Wagner, a family medicine doctor who has run a small practice in Hudson, Ohio, for the last 28 years. “It’s not like they came back to us saying, ‘Hey, we need more information,’” he said, adding that Aetna just paid the claims as if they’d been billed for a lower level of service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a practice called “downcoding.” Insurance companies — in Wagner’s case, Aetna — automatically downgrade the claims a doctor sends them to a lower tier of reimbursement, without actually reviewing details about the visit itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Wagner, that means a “level four” office visit that might yield $170 is being paid as if it’s a “level three” for about $125. That $45 difference might not seem like much, but when it’s happening on dozens of claims, and to a physician-owned practice like Wagner’s, the damage mounts. “This can really hit a small company hard, especially if you’re not catching it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the doctor wants to challenge the decision, they have to appeal each claim with documentation defending their medical opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Some computer program is deciding what my level of care is,” Wagner said. “If they question my level of care, then ask for my notes. Look at the tests I ordered. Look at my charts.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just Aetna: Other insurers including Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Humana and Molina Healthcare have all acknowledged downcoding higher level claims for certain office visits, or “adjusting” as it’s sometimes called. This summer, the insurer Cigna Healthcare announced that it will begin downcoding on certain claims starting in October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The practice of automatic downcoding seems to have taken off in the last few years, as health care costs soar and insurance companies use third party vendors and AI programs to reduce costs. NBC News spoke to doctors’ offices across numerous specialties from around the country, all of whom rely heavily on office visits — rather than surgeries and procedures — for their revenue, and all of whom are experiencing downcoding from insurers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem, doctors say, is that lower and lower reimbursements mean reliable community doctors, like Wagner, could have to make choices that are inherently bad for patients, like cramming more patient visits into a single day to make up for lost revenue, dropping patients on certain insurance plans, or selling their practices altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s a break point and it’s like you either see more [patients] and give them less time, or you just give up. It’s exhausting,” Wagner said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doctors being downcoded by Aetna are told they are coding visits “at a higher level” compared to their peers. “We may adjust your payment if the details on the claim don’t support the level of service billed,” a notice reviewed by NBC News says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar letter from Anthem says doctors “whose coding patterns improve and are no longer identified as an outlier are eligible to be removed from the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wagner's office estimates he lost over $3,000 to downcoding in the first half of the year, but other doctors across the country have fared far worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthem started downcoding Missouri dermatologist Dr. Sarah Jensen’s practice almost two years ago, Jensen said, to the tune of nearly $14,000 in lost payment. She's been able to recoup over a third of that through appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You almost lose that wherewithal to fight,” she said of the drudgery of filing appeal after appeal. “I mean, it’s kind of their goal I would imagine.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jensen said she feels stuck in an impossible situation. She can’t fit any more patient visits into her day without seriously affecting her standard of care, and because she recently opened a second office, simply turning away Anthem patients isn’t a financially viable option right now. (Anthem is Missouri’s largest commercial insurance provider.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She’s confident she’s billing appropriately and has even asked peers to spot-check her, but the downcodes just keep coming, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A representative for Anthem deferred to AHIP — a trade association representing the health insurance industry — for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for AHIP told NBC News that identifying “outlier practices” that are “out of step with their peers” is part of health plans’ efforts to “advance quality and affordability.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These policies are narrowly applied and enable plans to encourage practice patterns consistent with peers and clinical guidelines,” the spokesperson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aetna spokesperson David Whitrap said the insurer “has an obligation to monitor for appropriate coding on behalf of our clients and members,” and to “safeguard against fraud, waste, and abuse in the government programs we serve.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Evaluating the appropriateness of level 4 and 5 codes helps us ensure providers are billing for their services consistent with national guidelines,” Whitrap said. He also said that “only 3% of providers” are affected by the payment policy, but did not clarify how Aetna determines when providers are coding inappropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Cigna Healthcare said approximately 1% of providers in its network will be affected by its upcoming downcoding policy, and “all have the right to request we reconsider individual claims reimbursement decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humana and Molina Healthcare did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;“It’s going to worsen our patient care”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, the president of the American Medical Association (AMA), described downcoding as a “game” to improve insurers’ finances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s going to worsen our patient care, but it’s going to improve their bottom line,” Mukkamala said. “And that’s the wrong calculus to use to improve health care in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Momentum for automatic downcoding comes as experts say an inverse problem of “upcoding” is on the rise. Upcoding is when patients and plans are billed as though a higher level of service occurred, like when a bill is sent as though you had an appointment with the doctor, but you only ever saw a nurse practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services called upcoding “a serious problem” and the federal government periodically brings improper billing cases, both criminally and civilly, against health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the AMA position is that automatic downcoding — as opposed to insurers reimbursing for a lower level of service after reviewing additional information from physicians — doesn’t have any clinical logic behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, when you visit a doctor for a sinus infection, the doctor typically sends your insurance a claim referencing two sets of codes, one that lays out the ultimate diagnosis, and another that indicates the level of service or complexity of the visit. That level can be determined by the amount of time the doctor spends on the visit, or by the complexity of the medical decision-making at play — essentially a rubric that takes into account things like lab tests ordered, medications prescribed and treatment options discussed — but all that’s included on the claim is the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downcoding based only on that knowledge assumes that an office visit for a certain set of diagnoses has a ceiling of complexity, regardless of the patient’s medical history and the realities of what actually occurred during that visit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s where the AMA disagrees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“‘Guilty until proven innocent’ infers that we’re in a court, right? That I’m to have my chance to say, ‘This is why I did what I did. But when this isn’t announced and this is something that happens in the background, this is a conviction before there’s even a court trial,” Mukkamala said. “I deserve to know what you think I did wrong so I can tell you my opinion of why it’s right.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since March, the AMA has sent letters to Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna and AHIP calling out the insurers’ downcoding practices. None of the organizations replied, the AMA said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AMA sent a similar letter about what it called Aetna’s “unjustified, blunt payment reduction tool” to Aetna’s then-chief medical officer, Cathy Moffitt, in July 2024. The AMA would not disclose Moffitt’s response, but Aetna’s policy does not appear to have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 2024 marketing flyer for Aetna’s “Claim and Code Review Program” does offer a glimpse at the insurer’s financial calculus — touting an average 6.4% reduction in costs for employer health plans, or $1.6 million in savings for a plan with 4,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘Like breaking down Fort Knox’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cheryl Crowder runs billing for a physician-owned practice group in rural southeast Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than a year, she says her doctors have been repeatedly downcoded by two insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hospitals often have the benefit of robust billing teams that exist, in part, to deal with such reimbursement issues. But for small physician-owned practices, downcoding can be as much of an administrative burden as a financial one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have to copy records, and do claim audits and provide that information to them,” Crowder said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can also be costly. “We’re paying people overtime to do this work. Because we have 70-plus providers, and we have eight billers. It’s a ton of work,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like many of the doctors’ offices in this article, Crowder’s practice group was told they could be removed from a downcoding program if they successfully overturned a certain percentage of their appealed claims, but the mechanics of actually achieving that are hazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At what point do we measure that? Is it three months? Six months?” she said. “They couldn’t answer that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crowder even considered ending her practice group’s contract with one of the insurers before finally getting some relief this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the same time frame that downcoding has become prevalent, another trend is compounding the problem, doctors said: the disappearance of dedicated representatives at insurance companies, whom doctors could reach out to in case of payment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s like breaking down Fort Knox,” said Kelly Sutton, a family medicine practice manager in Van Wert, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April, Sutton noticed Aetna was downcoding higher complexity office visits. Then Anthem and Humana started doing it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She estimates her team is spending about four hours a week on appeals, and several more poring over documentation to see what might be causing the downcoding. But if there is a pattern, it remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I think they should spot-check physician’s offices, but whatever this algorithm is, it doesn’t seem to have a rhyme or reason,” Sutton said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘That is not good for patients’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Adrienne Hollander, a New Jersey-based rheumatologist, said when it comes to being downcoded by one of the main insurers she accepts, she’s simply at their mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They don’t send us a denial saying, ‘We don’t think that this is appropriate.’ They just automatically pay us less,” Hollander said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike Sutton’s practice, Hollander’s multiprovider rheumatology practice does have a representative at the insurer that’s downcoding her.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At least we have an email, a resource, that we can go to and be like, ‘Hey, tell us what’s going on here.’ A lot of people don’t have that,” said Jennifer Buonavolta, the operations director at Hollander’s practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even so, Hollander said she’s been unable to get out from under the downcoding program entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If we can’t fix this or renegotiate our contracts, then we stop taking insurers,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, her practice made the decision to stop accepting UnitedHealthcare over a different set of reimbursement frustrations. “The problem is that that is not good for patients, because there’s not a ton of rheumatologists,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, two states passed legislation regarding downcoding, both focused on transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But several other attempts at state legislation have stalled, including bills in Ohio and New Jersey that would have effectively banned automatic downcoding, and one in Connecticut aiming to prohibit specifically AI or algorithm-based downcoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AMA recently rolled out a template downcoding bill for interested states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mukkamala said his primary worry is that what doctors are experiencing now is just the beginning. “When an insurance company gets away with something like this, other insurance companies wouldn’t surprise me a bit if they said, ‘Well, that’s a good idea. We’re going to do that, too.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For doctors like Sarah Jensen, it’s easy to feel hopeless. In the past year, she’s sent letters to Missouri’s insurance commissioner, to the CEO of Anthem parent company Elevance, and to the American Academy of Dermatology. No one has been able to offer relief.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The share of doctors working in private practices has plummeted in recent years, driven in large part by the desire for better reimbursement rates. Jensen is coming to the reluctant conclusion that her days in private practice might, too, be numbered: She’s been talking to private equity about the idea of selling her practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s like death by a thousand cuts,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re introducing Figure 03, our 3rd generation humanoid robot. Figure 03 is designed for Helix, the home, and the world at scale. Our goal is to deliver a truly general-purpose robot - one that can perform human-like tasks and learn directly from people. To realize this vision, our engineering and design teams completed a ground-up hardware and software redesign to ship Figure 03 for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Helix: Figure 03 features a completely redesigned sensory suite and hand system which is purpose-built to enable Helix - Figure's proprietary vision-language-action AI.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The home: Figure 03 has several new features, including soft goods, wireless charging, improved audio system for voice reasoning, and battery safety advancements that make it safer and easier to use in a home environment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mass manufacturing: Figure 03 was engineered from the ground-up for high-volume manufacturing. In order to scale, we established a new supply chain and entirely new process for manufacturing humanoid robots at BotQ.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The world at scale: The lower manufacturing cost and the advancements made for Helix have significant benefits for commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designed for Helix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no path to scaling humanoid robots without AI. That’s why we built Figure 03 around one goal - to enable true reasoning throughout the world using Helix. Figure 03 introduces a fully redesigned sensory suite and hand system, purpose-built to bring Helix to life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 03 introduces a next-generation vision system engineered for high-frequency visuomotor control. Its new camera architecture delivers twice the frame rate, one-quarter the latency, and a 60% wider field of view per camera - all within a more compact form factor. Combined with an expanded depth of field, this architecture provides Helix with a denser, more stable perceptual stream. These advancements are essential for intelligent navigation and precise manipulation in complex, cluttered spaces such as homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each hand now integrates an embedded palm camera with a wide field of view and low-latency sensing, which offers redundant, close-range visual feedback during grasps. These cameras allow Helix to maintain visual awareness even when the main cameras are occluded (i.e. when reaching into a cabinet or working in confined spaces) and enable continuous, adaptive control in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Figure 03 hands represent a major leap in compliant and tactile design. Softer, more adaptive fingertips increase surface contact area, enabling more stable grasps across objects of varied shapes and sizes. After surveying existing market options, Figure found that current tactile sensors had inherent limitations that could not withstand real-world use. This led to the internal development of our first-generation tactile sensor, guided by three principles: extreme durability, long-term reliability, and high-fidelity sensing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each fingertip sensor can detect forces as small as three grams of pressure - sensitive enough to register the weight of a paperclip resting on your finger. This precision enables Helix to distinguish between a secure grip and an impending slip before it occurs, allowing fine-grained, dexterous control over fragile, irregular, or moving objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 03 also includes 10 Gbps mmWave data offload capability, allowing the entire fleet to upload terabytes of data for continuous learning and improvement. Together, these advancements position Figure 03 as uniquely capable of large-scale, end-to-end pixels-to-action learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designed for the Home&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To operate effectively in the home, a robot must work seamlessly alongside people in their daily environments. With this in mind, Figure 03 introduces several design improvements focused on safety. It features strategically placed multi-density foam to protect against pinch points, and is covered in soft textiles rather than hard machined parts. Figure 03 also has 9% less mass and significantly less volume than Figure 02, making it easier to maneuver through household spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Figure 03 battery pushes the bounds for robot battery safety and incorporates multiple layers of protection against abuse or malfunction, including safeguards at the Battery Management System (BMS), cell, interconnect, and pack levels. The battery has already achieved certification to the UN38.3 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond safety, Figure 03 is designed for everyday usability. The soft goods are fully washable and can be removed or replaced without tools, allowing quick and easy swaps. The robot can also be customized with various clothing options, including garments made from cut-resistant and durable materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it easier to communicate naturally with the robot, Figure 03 features an upgraded audio hardware system for better real time speech-to-speech. Compared with Figure 02, its speaker is twice the size and nearly four times more powerful, while the microphone has been repositioned for improved performance and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing our vision for a fully autonomous, wire-free system, Figure 03 is capable of wireless inductive charging alongside wireless data offload. Charging coils in the robot’s feet allow it to simply step onto a wireless stand and charge at 2 kW. In a home setting, this means the robot can automatically dock and recharge itself as needed throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designed for Mass Manufacturing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humanoid robots have traditionally been designed as engineering prototypes which are time consuming and expensive to produce. Figure 03 is our first robot engineered from the ground-up for high-volume manufacturing. We achieved this through three major initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Design and process reinvention&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Establishing an entirely new supply chain&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The invention of BotQ, our high-volume manufacturing facility&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving from Figure 02 to Figure 03 required redesigning nearly every component of the robot with manufacturability and cost in mind. The mechanical and electrical engineering teams aggressively reduced part count, assembly steps, and any components that were not absolutely critical to meet design requirements. While Figure 02 was primarily designed to be manufactured with CNC machining, Figure 03 relies heavily on tooled processes such as die-casting, injection molding, and stamping. This shift demanded a significant up-front investment in tooling, but the payoff is clear: each Figure 03 unit now costs dramatically less to build, with the economics improving as volumes grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To scale Figure 03, Figure had to build an entirely new supply chain for an industry where one does not currently exist. Figure chose to vertically integrate across many critical module builds including actuators, batteries, sensors, structures, and electronics, all of which were designed completely in-house. For individual components, Figure strategically identified and partnered with suppliers capable of meeting the required volumes, timelines, and strict quality standards demanded by the team. The result of this year-long effort is a global network of partners who can grow alongside Figure and meet production goals of thousands and eventually millions of parts under an aggressive ramp schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BotQ is Figure’s dedicated manufacturing facility designed to scale robot production. BotQ’s first-generation manufacturing line will initially be capable of producing up to 12,000 humanoid robots per year, with the goal of producing a total of 100,000 robots over the next four years. Instead of relying on contract manufacturers, Figure brought production of its most critical systems in-house to maintain tight control over quality, iteration, and speed. The facility is equipped with state-of-the-art systems and digital integrations, anchored by our internally developed Manufacturing Execution System (MES). Every subassembly and final assembly passes through this line with full traceability, ensuring quality, repeatability, and continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designed for the World at Scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure’s focus on the home market in no way detracts from the potential of Figure 03 for the commercial market. By solving for the variability and intractability of the home, Figure is developing a truly general-purpose product that can do the widest possible range of tasks in the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 03 is well suited for commercial applications for several reasons. The actuators can perform at 2x faster speeds with improved torque density (nm/kg). The most significant result of this is our ability to pick and place items at faster speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The improvements to the hands and sensory suite made for Helix are of major significance for commercial use cases. With the camera and perception system upgrades, Figure 03 will be able to intelligently navigate commercial environments and execute precise manipulation. The changes to the hands highlighted above (added compliance, fingertip surface area, tactile sensing) enable better and more stable grasps across an array of objects such as small pieces of sheet metal and deformable poly bags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to inductive charging, Figure 03 is capable of near-continuous operation as long as it can step onto a charging mat for a certain period of time during the use case. The fast wireless data offload also means that the robot can offload seamlessly during shift breaks just by returning to the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commercial customers can also design distinct uniforms for their Figure 03 fleet, with the option to use more durable, or cut-proof materials, and make other design changes for specific environments. New side screens on Figure 03 even allow quick identification across large fleets and can be fully customized to match each customer’s branding or operational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 03 represents an unprecedented advancement in taking humanoid robots from experimental prototypes to deployable, scalable products. By uniting advanced perception and tactile intelligence with home-safe design and mass-manufacturing readiness, Figure has built a platform capable of learning, adapting, and working across both domestic and commercial settings. Designed for Helix, the home, and the world at scale, Figure 03 establishes the foundation for true general-purpose robotics - one capable of transforming how people live and work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though I spend the majority of my time working with microcontroller class devices, I also have an embarassingly robust collection of single board computers (SBC), including a few different Raspberry Pi models, the BeagleV Starlight Beta (RIP), and more. Typically when setting up these devices for whatever automation task I have planned for them, I’ll use “headless mode” and configure initial user and network credentials when writing the operating system to the storage device using a tool like Raspberry Pi’s Imager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, sometimes direct physical access to the SBC with a monitor and keyboard is useful for initial configuration, maintenance operations, or workloads that have a visual component. As someone who doesn’t use any external monitors1 for my daily development, digging up an HDMI monitor, finding somewhere to put it, and connecting it to the device is an annoying process. Furthermore, if I’m on the go I almost certainly don’t have easy access to an external monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi boot logs shown in VLC media player.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I rarely ever do this because I have a handful of HDMI to USB capture cards, ranging from extremely cheap variants from Amazon, to the higher quality Elgato Cam Link 4k. These are typically used for live streaming a video feed from DSLR / mirrorless cameras or gaming consoles, but they also serve as a great option for capturing video from any other device that has HDMI output. On my System76 Linux daily driver laptop, I can use any number of different video playback applications to display the HDMI output via the capture card. For longer term use cases, I can breathe new life into one of my old laptops, using the capture card to effectively convert it into a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;vlc v4l2:///dev/video0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ffplay /dev/video0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cheese v4l2:///dev/video0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do want to stream or record the SBC output, OBS will give you even more control. You’ll still need a USB keyboard, but I already use one with my laptop, so temporarily plugging it into the SBC for configuration while I use the laptop as a monitor is minimally disruptive. However, if you find yourself regularly needing to connect to multiple machines, it might be time to consider getting a KVM switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I just sit here with my one laptop screen. Can you believe that? ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(With thanks to Seth Larson for taking me down this rabbit hole.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I always assumed that Python's &lt;code&gt;str.splitlines()&lt;/code&gt; split strings by
"universal newlines", i.e., &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it turns out it does a lot more than that. From the docs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method splits on the following line boundaries. In particular, the boundaries are a superset of universal newlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;th&gt;Representation&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Line Feed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Carriage Return&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Carriage Return + Line Feed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\v&lt;/code&gt;Â orÂ&lt;code&gt;\x0b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Line Tabulation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\f&lt;/code&gt;Â orÂ&lt;code&gt;\x0c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Form Feed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\x1c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;File Separator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\x1d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Group Separator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\x1e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Record Separator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\x85&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Next Line (C1 Control Code)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\u2028&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Line Separator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\u2029&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Paragraph Separator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This results in some surprising (to me) splitting behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;   =  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  
 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whereas I would have expected:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a good periodic reminder that Unicode does not mean "printable," and that there are still plenty of ecosystems that assign semantics to C0 and C1 control codes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;New nanotherapy clears amyloid-β reversing Alzheimer’s in mice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posted: 7 October 2025 | Drug Target Review | No comments yet&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed bioactive nanoparticles that restore the brain’s blood-brain barrier and clear toxic proteins, reversing Alzheimer’s symptoms in mice and offering a promising new approach to treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new study by a research team co-led by the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and West China Hospital Sichuan University (WCHSU), in collaboration with partners in the UK, have used a nanotechnology strategy that reverses Alzheimer’s disease in mice. Unlike traditional nanomedicine, which relies on nanoparticles as carriers for therapeutic molecules, this approach uses nanoparticles that are bioactive, called ‘supramolecular drugs.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of targeting neurons directly, this method focuses on repairing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the brain’s defence against harmful substances. By restoring proper BBB function, the researchers achieved a reversal of Alzheimer’s pathology in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The importance of brain vasculature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brain consumes the greatest amount energy out of any other organ in the body, consuming 20 percent in adults and up to 60 percent in children. This energy is delivered through a dense vascular system in which each neuron is nourished by a capillary. With approximately one billion capillaries in the human brain, maintaining vascular health is crucial, particularly in conditions like Alzheimer’s, where vascular function is weakened and linked to disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Biomarkers are redefining how precision therapies are discovered, validated and delivered. &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This exclusive expert-led report reveals how leading teams are using biomarker science to drive faster insights, cleaner data and more targeted treatments – from discovery to diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The BBB is a protective barrier between the brain and blood flow, stopping harmful substances such as pathogens and toxins from entering. By targeting specific mechanisms within the BBB, the research team enabled the removal of undesirable waste proteins produced in the brain. In Alzheimer’s disease, the main waste protein is amyloid-β (Aβ), whose accumulation disrupts normal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rapid reduction of amyloid-β&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their approach in mice genetically programmed to overproduce Aβ and develop cognitive decline similar to Alzheimer’s pathology. Following only three doses of supramolecular drugs, the team observed significant therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following only three doses of supramolecular drugs, the team observed significant therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Only 1hr after the injection we observed a reduction of 50-60 percent in Aβ amount inside the brain,” said Junyang Chen, first co-author of the study, researcher at WCHSU and PhD student at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behavioural tests conducted over several months demonstrated remarkable improvements. In one experiment, a 12-month-old mouse – equivalent to a 60-year-old human – received the nanoparticles and was evaluated six months later. The animal, now 18 months old – comparable to a 90-year-old human – exhibited the behaviour of a healthy mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Restoring natural clearance mechanisms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain’s vasculature. We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance. What’s remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels,” explained Giuseppe Battaglia, ICREA Research Professor at IBEC and leader of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally, the protein LRP1 acts as a molecular gatekeeper, binding to Aβ and transporting it across the BBB for elimination. In Alzheimer’s, this system becomes fragile, leading to Aβ accumulation. The supramolecular drugs mimic LRP1 ligands, binding to Aβ and initiating its clearance, effectively resetting the system and restoring vascular function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A new therapeutic possibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The nanoparticles are designed using a bottom-up molecular engineering approach, combining precise size control with defined surface ligands to interact with cellular receptors in a highly specific manner. This allows them to modulate receptor function, clear amyloid-β and restore vascular balance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance, restoring healthy function in the blood–brain barrier and leading to a striking reversal of Alzheimer’s pathology,” said Lorena Ruiz Perez, researcher at IBEC and Serra Hunter Assistant Professor at the University of Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates how restoring the brain’s vascular function with bioactive nanoparticles can clear toxic proteins and reverse cognitive decline in mice. The findings could lead to further development pf new therapies that target vascular health to combat neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently shared my current Homelab setup with a colleague and was asked a pretty simple question I just took for granted... why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why go through the hassle of configuring servers, installing applications, setting up containers and spending quite a substantial amount of money on hardware that will not even run under optimal data center conditions (consumer-grade internet connection, no failover, no auto migrations)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will also give some specific recommendations on what you could and maybe should self-host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Privacy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You saw that coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy is not a god-given right but has to be fought for. Big Tech and governments (like with chat control in the EU) want to shine light in every part of your personal life. Self-hosting services can reduce or even completely mitigate the risk of being surveilled. But it also requires a lot of technical knowledge so you can make a difference and educate your family or friends and even host some services for those who don't have the capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Calendar &amp;amp; Contacts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your calendar says more about you than you probably think. Apart from your full identity it can also give away information about regular contacts, family, coworkers, confidential business meetings, your health information such as medical appointments, sleep and workout routine, legal obligations, financial information like scheduled loans, subscriptions, political beliefs through scheduling to visit a protest and even let's other profile your behavior for identity theft to find out when you're available and when not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same goes for contacts, your social graph can say so much about you, combined with metadata such as queries for certain contacts and creation dates. Did you recently add an unusual amount of new contacts with the same sex, first name only and phone number? You must be dating. Just created a contact for a doctor? Looks like you're visiting a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people don't even think about where their social graph data is stored and probably assume it comes with their phone when in reality that data is being processed by Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever knows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't want a single company holding all that sensitive information and possibly deriving data points from that. Even with Apple's Advanced Data Protection your calendars and contacts are not end-to-end encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Location&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many many years ago I was running an Android phone with Google services like Google Maps. One day I was looking for a feature in my Google account and saw that GMaps recorded my location history for years with detailed geocoordinates about every trip and every visit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was fascinated but also scared about that since I've never actually enabled it myself. I do like the fact that I could look up my location for every point in time but I want to be in control about that and know that only I have access to that data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So much more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's beyond the scope of this post to list every possible way, your data can be traced back to you and argument why you should be conscious about that. I want to motivate you to start a new journey!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sovereignty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digital sovereignty for me means to be in control of, choosing what I do with and controlling who I share my data with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You constantly hear about cases of tech companies locking down accounts with no apparent reason and it even happened to me in the past with Google. I do not want to be at the mercy of a giant tech firm which you can not even contact or if - get annoyed by a garbage AI chat bot (see my Microsoft rant for more fun). Besides - why are there no regulatory requirements for tech companies to provide a way to get in contact with an actual human?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like protocols and file standards, no "Gmail" API - we call that thing SMTP and IMAP (yes, they are dated but the best we currently have. Thus I still welcome the new JMAP initiative). Another paragraph without bashing Microsoft? Hell no, Big Tech like Microsoft really wants you to use their AI-Copoilit-enabled-365-Office-Live-Outlook &lt;del&gt;spyware&lt;/del&gt; software - that's why they have recently disabled SMTP access for Office 365 accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What to self-host&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's get to the bread and butter of this article and give some straightforward examples on what to self-host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of those applications need to be available outside of your local network if you don't want to be constantly connected to a VPN. I will write more about how to do that securely and all available options in an upcoming post. If you want to read that, subscribe to the RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hardware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm fortunate enough to work at a company (enum.co) where digital sovereignty is not just a phrase. That's why I got provided with three mini servers where I'm running a highly available Kubernetes cluster (which my boss also helped me set up, thanks Max!). Also... more on that in a later blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Calendar &amp;amp; Contacts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As stated above, calendar and contact data is more sensitive than one might think. This is why I am hosting my own CalDAV / CardDAV server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some options on servers for you which all have their ups and downs. Here are just a few:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Radicale (Python, basic web ui, only single user, does not work with apple devices from my experience)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â BaÃ¯kal (PHP, active development, advanced web ui, multi-user)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DAViCal (PHP, haven't tried)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Xandikos (Python, No built-in authentication, no web ui)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nextcloud (PHP, If you're already using it go for it - too bloated for me)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being conscious about what other can do with your calendar and contact data also mean to review, which apps have access to your contact book and calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh no, I said the forbidden phrase: Self-hosted mail server. I was always told to never under any circumstances do that. But it's really not that deep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Recent" developments like Stalwart or Mailcow made it really easy and straighforward to self-host email. Beware I'm not talking about marketing mails but rather personal inboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, you don't want to self-host your mail server at home since it requires a static IP and needs to be reachable from the whole internet. Going into that, you want to start with a clean IP address. Choose a hoster you trust, get a server, look up the IP address in mail blacklists and repeat until you get a clean one. After setting up the server, you want to make sure you can receive mail and every required protocol has been correctly configured. I found the internet.nl online test tool to be super usefull to ensure everything works. Start by sending mails to Google, Microsoft and Yahoo addresses to check if your mails are getting redirected to SPAM. Iterate on that, check DNS, DMARC, SPF, TLS etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will probably write a detailed blog post on that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Smart Home&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started hosting my own Home Assistant instance a couple of years ago it was just an experiment to see what I can do since I wasn't really missing anything with Apple Homekit. Since then more and more smart home companies went bankrupt, sunsetted their cloud services, jacked up prices or put free services behind a paywall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, Home Assistant paid off a couple of weeks ago when I heard that Philips Hue will force users to create an account just to use any feature for their lights, they already paid real money for. I've always configured Firewall rules to disallow any outgoing network traffic for smart home appliances but it seems like I cannot use any Philips Hue app specific features (like animated light patterns imitating candles etc.) even on my local network. I haven't looked into this but I hope there's some community plugin which emulates this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will never, under any circumstances, create an online account for an appliance I will only use locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also I am now obsessed with tracking energy usage and plan on building and developing a Raspberry Pi + camera device which tracks energy usage of gas meter via machine vision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;RSS Aggregator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am subscribed to many news sites and blogs over RSS which is by itself already decentralized and sovereign. This is why self-hosting an RSS aggregator is kind of optional and only the last mile to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On my iPhone and Mac I'm running NetNewsWire, in my opinion the best RSS reader, even open source and backed by incredible people. NetNewsWire comes with a native integration for FreshRSS - a feed aggregator that also provides many more features like filtering and lets you subscribe to sources which don't natively provide an RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Location Tracker&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've deployed an instance of dawarich (German for "I was there") which is a server for ingesting and viewing geolocation data. It also allows you to choose from many available mobile apps which can track send your current location to the server. At the time of writing this includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;official dawarich app (always shows a navigation icon in the iOS notch)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Overland (high battery drain for me)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â Owntracks (works best for me on iOS, only app settings are crazy confusing)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ideas &amp;amp; Outlook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently re-worked my homelab and went from a single big server to a 3 node Kubernetes cluster. This gives me much more flexibility in the kind of applications I can host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a list of apps and tools I want to have a look at:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EteSync: End-to-end encrypted CalDAV &amp;amp; CardDAV&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AnyType: Self-hosting my own AnyType server instance&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Passbolt: Password manager (no I really don't like Bitwarden)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;BirdNET: Monitoring bird species outside with a microphone&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;penpot: Like Figma but free &amp;amp; open source&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Habitica: Habit manager&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;vert: File converter&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;InvoiceShelf: Invoice manager&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also selfh.st - a great resource where can spend hours finding self-hostable applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firmware &amp;amp; goodies for making a Keyer (one-handed version of a chorded keyboard).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimal finger movement: it's like typing with all the keys on your home row all the time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Free hand while typing: you can use your other hand to sip tea while typing (or move the mouse - if you're not a tea drinking type)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Always near your hand - keyer can be attached to a glove so you can just release it and have both of your hands free. Now you can drink your tea and move the mouse at the same time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tons of chords: a 10-key keyer (3 keys on thumb, 2 index, 2 middle, 2 ring, 1 pinky) can express up to 215 chords (× 2 when counting hold-chord alternatives). With so many chords you can lose a finger and still touch type (carpenters love it!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arpeggios: an additional 2 × 78 arpeggios - rolling motion over two keys that can be executed in two directions and can be used for even more input options.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple layers: if the 586 shortcuts available on the base layer are somehow not enough for you&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rolling chords: when two subsequent chords you're entering share some finger positions you can only move the finger that changes position. When combined with optimized layouts (see the next point) typing is like walking through the keys one finger at a time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized layout: a bundled layout optimizer will perform a combinatorial search over all possible layouts to find the optimal one for typing the texts that you give it (or for your custom finger press / finger movement cost function)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ergonomic layout 🖖: did you know your fingers share the neuro-motor pathways and can't always move independently? The layout generator will avoid finger combinations that are hard to press.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low-latency: the firmware relies on hardware interrupts and a zero-latency digital debouncing algorithm to make the keys more responsive than polling-based keyboards (and keyboards with capacitor-based debouncers).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Power for months: a massive 18650 battery + underclocked CPU + firmware able to sleep without losing the Bluetooth connection + hardware power switch on the board mean that you will charge it about as often as a Casio watch.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🕶️: combine it with smart glasses to control your computer (or smartphone) without looking or touching. It's like Meta EMG wristband but actually working!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy to build: did you ever play with Play-Doh? This keyer was built with modelling clay (baked in the oven for 30 minutes). No 3D printing. No custom PCBs. You can make it with parts from amazon, a hot glue gun and a soldering iron.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perfect fit: you build it yourself, literally modelling it to the shape of your hand. You can't get more ergonomic than that.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cheap to build: it's less than 50 USD to make one yourself. Mechanical keyboards are a cheap hobby now!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Penti Chorded Keyboard - A software keyer that can run on a touchscreen. Notable for its use of arpeggios.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keyyyyyyyys! - Can you get cheaper than that?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ESP32-BLE-Keyboard - The best way to emulate a BLE keyboard from ESP32.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the bottom of the ergonomic mechanical keyboard rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start with some shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LILYGO T-Energy S3 development board ($9.70)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Samsung INR18650-35E 3500mAh Li-ion battery (~$2.95)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FIMO professional modelling clay ($2.75) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Alternatively, one of the FIMO effect modelling clays if you'd like to make your keyer out of stone&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10 × Gateron G Pro 3.0 mechanical switches (~$10) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Alternatively other switches of your choice&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10 × Keycaps (~$8) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;You only need ten of them so feel free to get the coolest keycaps you can find&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1m × AWG 18 rigid, insulated copper wire (~$1) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Get it from a local hardware store, the online stores are ripping you off&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can come with your development board to see which wire gauge fits through the holes on the board&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total: $34.40 (+shipping)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pliers - for bending the copper wire&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a knife (or a set of sharp teeth) - for stripping the cable insulation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;(optional) nitryl gloves - for not getting dirty while working with the modelling clay&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hot glue gun + hot glue sticks - for attaching the components to a wire scaffolding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;soldering iron + solder wire - for soldering&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all the materials and tools in hand, the first step is to form a metal scaffolding which will hold the switches in convenient positions. Traditional electronics devices tends to have "exoskeletons" - they're supported by an external case that surrounds them and protects them from your greasy fingers. This device is built around an endoskeleton of copper wire. We'll cover this endoskeleton with modelling clay in a moment. I hope you bought the thickest wire you could (while still fitting through the holes on the board) because in this device it's structural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll start with a "GND loop". Cut a section of wire - about 20 or 30cm. Strip its insulation &amp;amp; insert it into one of the GND holes on the board. Solder it in place - it should be firmly attached to the board. Insert the battery and take the board in your hand. Position it like you'd like it to stay in your hand and start bending the wire into a loop that goes through all the places where key switches bases are going to be placed. For some extra rigidity (long wire is fairly bendy) lead the other end of the wire back into another GND hole on the board. You can take the switches with keycaps and place them so that one of their contact points touch the wire. This will give you a better idea of how the keyer is going to end up looking. Don't worry about it being wobbly - we'll use this property to model it a little in a moment. First complete the loop by soldering the other end of the GND loop to the board. If your GND loop happens to pass near other GND holes, you can insert short sections of wire to increase the rigidity of the construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once GND loop is complete, take your key switches and attach them to the GND loop so that one of their contact points makes an electrical contact. You can solder them directly but it's a good idea to start with some hot glue to hold them in place. In my version I also bent the contacts on the key switches to make them smaller (DIY low profile) and to take less space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you're going through the process the keyer is going to become more "complete" and you will be able to bend the wire a little to improve key positioning. Remember that hot glue and solder don't form particularly strong bonds so be careful about bending and ideally use pliers to do that precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One word of advice about key positioning is that I've noticed that the keys are "nicest" to press when the axis of pressing goes straight into the palm of your hand. Motions that go parallel to palm of the hand, motions that extend fingers and motions that move fingers to the side are pretty awkward and uncomfortable. I guess our hands evolved to hold things, rather than poke or flick at them. Some keyboard manufacturers might disagree. Their keyboards look undeniably awesome, but this is your keyer and it should be comfortable to use - so make sure the keys are pressed in the same direction that you'd hold something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you attached all of the keys, it's time to add even more rigidity into our construction. We'll do this by connecting the remaining contact points on the switches to the GPIO holes on the board. They're marked on the board with text that says "IO##". It doesn't matter which IO port you choose, but write down which key goes to which IO port - it's something that will have to be entered in the firmware. Take a short cut of the wire, strip it at both ends. Bend it (with pliers) so that it fits in the hole and goes straight to the switch. Then solder it in place at both ends. It's important that the wires going to the IO ports don't touch the GND loop. Insulation should help with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this step, the keyer should be fairly rigid. Mount the keycaps and see how it feels. It's obviously a little "spiky" but we'll deal with that in the next step. Right now bend the wires to put all the key switches in their right positions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point you can go to the "Flashing Firmware" section and check out how your keyer works! It's good to see if you didn't mess anything up so far. The hardest part is over!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now is the time to open up the modelling clay and use it to cover our keyer. Before you begin, remove the keycaps, as they'll only get in the way. Take a small amount of clay and start shaping it in your hand. Squeeze it and fold in half. Repeat this about twenty times. Modelling clay must be mixed like that a little to prevent it from crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have your warm and soft piece of clay, slap it on top of the keyer - wherever you want to cover something. It's important to cover the bottom parts of the switches - that's the part that may prick your fingers. Everything else is optional. I decided to keep my development board mostly visible and only covered the wires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you're sticking pieces of clay, one after another, you may find the resulting shape a little bit ugly. Turns out modelling stuff out of clay is hard! I've found a couple of tricks that may help you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add clay in layers. Take a small ball of clay and place it between two popsicle sticks. Roll it into a flat disc with a rolling pin. Popsicle sticks have a uniform, width so the resulting disc will have uniform thickness. Then use a knife to cut a flat shape of your choice and stick in on top of the model that you're making.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you see a gap between chunks of clay - rub them. Keep rubbing them until the gap disappears. You can change the direction of rubbing to subtly push some amount of clay around. It can be used to even up tiny hills and valleys.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The best way of evening uneven edges is to use a knife. Ideally a wallpaper knife. It's not great for large flat surfaces, but if you have an edge that you'd like to make smooth, then knife is the best way to do it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is a cool one. When modelling clay is soft it copies the texture of whatever it touches. You can use a piece of fabric to make it look like a fuzzy fabric. If you take a glass you can make it glossy. Look around you and see what nice textures you have around.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try to take the keyer in your hand at this point but be careful. The clay is very pliable and may deform under the pressure of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One useful thing at this point is to try to put on the keycaps and to see whether they can be pressed all the way in. If they cannot - then either the clay (or the keycap) has to be trimmed. At this point the clay is still soft so it's easy to correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you're done with modelling (it can take a couple of hours) heat up an oven to 110°C and put your keyer inside. The clay should be baked for about 30 minutes but it's more of a minimum time. Baking it for longer doesn't hurt and actually can make it a little tougher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, I hope you removed the battery before putting the keyer in the oven. If you didn't then you'll have to get a new one (oven). And call the fire department.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming you removed the battery beforehand, after baking, the clay should be fairly tough - roughly as hard as high quality plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install PlatformIO Core&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connect the T-Energy S3 development board to your computer via USB.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run these commands:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/mafik/Keyer.git

# Enter the cloned directory
$ cd Keyer

# Build project
$ pio run

# Upload firmware
$ pio run --target upload&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open Bluetooth settings on your phone or PC. If you see a device called "𝖒𝖆𝖋.🎹", that means it's working.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go to a text editor and find &lt;code&gt;ChordKeyboard.cpp&lt;/code&gt;. Change the&lt;code&gt;kButtonPin&lt;/code&gt;array to the IO ports that you used for connecting the switches. Feel free to explore this file and experiment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable serial output by uncommenting the &lt;code&gt;Serial.begin&lt;/code&gt;line and running the program with&lt;code&gt;pio run --target upload --target monitor&lt;/code&gt;. This will let you see what the board is doing while you're fiddling with the code and pressing the keys.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's getting late so this is the point at which I'll leave you on your own. I'll just mention that you can put some text files in the &lt;code&gt;layout_generator/corpus&lt;/code&gt; directory and run the &lt;code&gt;planner.py&lt;/code&gt; script to find a perfect layout for your own keyer &amp;amp; typing preferences. You can tweak the &lt;code&gt;keyer_simulator.cpp&lt;/code&gt; to adjust finger press &amp;amp; movement costs. Within &lt;code&gt;planner.py&lt;/code&gt; you'll find some code for generating layouts that follow some memorable patterns. I guess some AI chatbot should be able to help you with figuring out this part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default layout was generated using a mix of English, Polish, C++ and Python code so you might benefit from dropping some of your favorite texts and seeing what comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add an I2C 6-axis accelerometer and make the keyer function as an air mouse (like some LG remotes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce the number of keys - 6 keys (2 thumb, 1 index, 1 middle, 1 ring, 1 pinky) should actually be enough for most uses&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Tweak FreeRTOS configuration

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Programmer in Wonderland&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Wonderland of Software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ecosystem of software engineering is vast and it seems to be ever-growing, although recently at a slower pace. There are hundreds and thousands of tools and frameworks out there, often solving the same problems or struggling to explain what the problem they are trying to solve is. Sometimes, it can be quite confusing to ascertain whether solving a problem yourself would not be faster than researching and learning all the tools that are available out there. Sometimes, it begs the question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Does the ever increasing use of external tools and dependencies really make us more productive and our systems more reliable?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of this diversity and how powerful some of these tools are, it often feels like Magic. So many things possible, so fast and seemingly without a cost, without tradeoffs. But is it really the case?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are multiple frontend frameworks and more ways of using them still and all the buzzwords! Should we build Single Page Application (SPA)? What about Global State Management? Micro Frontends anyone? What about Search Engine Optimization (SEO)? Shouldn't we use Server Side Rendering (SRR) and/or Static Site Generation (SSG) for it? What about Hydration? (hint: it is not related to water)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the same vein, there is a multitude of backend frameworks, tools and related buzzwords. Certainly, we like to talk about magical things like Object Relational Mapping (ORM), Non-blocking IO, Event Sourcing, Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Service Meshes, Observability, Serverless Computing, Containerization or Virtualization that gets truly too virtual at times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this bottomless ocean of abstractions, how to make sense of it all? As mentioned briefly, how we arrived at this point of relying on so many tools and abstractions, and whether it remains productive, is a separate topic I do not cover here. Fortunately, there is hope and a solution. Unfortunately, I think that the default reaction to this state of affairs is quite different, strange and rather unproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Lost Programmer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a certain type of programmer who I would call The Lost Programmer, in the Wonderland of Software of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These usually are individuals highly specialized in one or two specific areas. They might be able to work exclusively on the frontend and not be willing to do any other work, even to the smallest degree, like writing a few SQL queries, automating something simple with the help of a few Bash/Python or fixing broken CI/CD pipeline. They want to stay in their comfort zone, in the sphere of things that they know, and do not leave it or leave it as rarely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quite often, they are not only highly specialized in one specific area but also know how to operate one or two tools they are currently focusing on. Working on the previous example, they might write frontend (it is the same for backend people) in one of the latest and over-engineered frameworks like Nuxt.js or Next.js. They might learn everything they can about how to use their current tool; all the docs, all methods, APIs and CLI commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most often they do this only at the surface level. They know specifics of their tool but they do not know how and why it works, what happens under the hood, how it is all made possible. They would write their UI in the Next.js and say that to build and deploy it to production you just need to do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;next build
next start
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does it do you ask? It prepares and runs the Next.js app of course! What does it mean? What do you mean, what does it mean? It just builds and starts the Next.js app! And the conversation goes on like this; they seem to have no idea what is really happening there. Is their app one or a bunch of static files? Does it require a server to dynamically render content based on the request data? Where and how communication with the backend happens? On the client side? On the dedicated frontend server side? How can you configure this app differently based on the environment - dev, stage or prod? They have no clue and do not seem to care about these details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is no better for backend or ops people. Details change, but the problem and approach is the same. For backend guys, they would use the Spring Framework with Hibernate and count on magic like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@Transactional
void createUser(User user) {
  sqlRepository.save(user);
  var userCreatedEvent = new UserCreatedEvent(user);
  kafkaPublisher.publish(userCreatedEvent);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, they think that this &lt;code&gt;@Transactional&lt;/code&gt; annotation magically makes everything transactional, no matter what it is. Despite the fact that a sql database and message broker like Kafka represent two completely independent systems separated by the network and the transactionality between them cannot be achieved. Again, The Lost Programmer is not curious about understanding details like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, why call them Lost? Maybe they are just specialized and pragmatic? Well, this approach and overreliance on tools and frameworks is all sunshine and roses until. Until they do not work according to the docs and/or made assumptions, and fixing them requires understanding all or most of the details that the given tool/framework tries to hide behind its abstractions. Then, The Lost Programmer is truly lost:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;when their ORM framework generates SQL queries that take ages to complete and constantly spike database CPU usage to 100% and they do not know the basics of SQL and how the relational databases work&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;when they include all &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;in the final Docker image and wonder why it takes over an hour to build and deploy their app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;when their Single Page Application is just a set of public static files (they probably do not know) and they wonder how they can have secrets, with a single build, embedded safely there; preferably with different values depending on the environment as well&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;when in their &lt;code&gt;@Transactional&lt;/code&gt;magic method they make two synchronous network requests to other services and wonder why although the whole thing has failed, the data was indeed partially changed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we can imagine, consequences of this approach can be rather dire but not immediately obvious: subtle, hard to trace bugs might be introduced into the system at any point. When they appear, The Lost Programmer is indeed totally lost. They lack understanding, knowledge and probably most importantly - curiosity, to prevent and fix problems of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are also lost in the sense of being tied to the tool they now primarily use. If they do not understand how their tools work, they are not in control. They cannot recreate a part of their functionality themselves and if they want to change the tool, it can often feel like starting all over again; with the lack of understanding of fundamentals, they are bound to learn ever-changing and ephemeral abstractions that hide them. Additionally, they can be easily intimidated by all the buzzwords and marketing campaigns of the tools, since they do not know what is under the hood and how it all works. It truly is magic to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To sum it up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Tools used in the right context are great and makes programmers life easier. What is more, in many cases, without such tools complex software projects would simply not be possible to complete. On the other hand, too many tools and often shallow, superficial understanding of them, especially as to why and when to use them and why and when to avoid them, can lead to some serious issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, we would rather not be The Lost Programmer. What is the solution then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wake up and make the Magic go away&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is that simple. Learn your fundamentals and by all means use various tools and frameworks! But first, understand what they do, how they work and why you use them, so they are actually your (optional) tools, not masters. This needs to be tailored a bit to your area of computing, but in general, read about operating systems, how CPU and memory works, experiment with various data structures and networking protocols, write a little bit of assembler or machine code even, understand some basic cryptography, study battle-tested open source projects and maybe most importantly - implement some of those lower-level functionalities on your own, from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After doing that, you will make the Magic go away and be in a position where you can go and implement your own HTTP Server, Database Client, Web/SPA framework or Web Components library, if you want to. Becoming this person, you are much better able to judge the merits and usefulness of tools that are out there, on the market. What is more, they are truly optional for you; if, in some contexts or circumstances, it turns out that it is just better and faster for you to build something totally or partially from scratch, you have all the ability and power to do so. If, on the other hand, a given tool turns out to be of great value to you, you will now appreciate it even more, knowing exactly how it works and what it takes to build one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, be A Great Programmer, not The Lost One: have your basics and fundamentals covered and study the tools you regularly use deeply and broadly. Then, you know exactly what you and them are doing; you are in control and they truly are your tools, not masters.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A small number of samples can poison LLMs of any size&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a joint study with the UK AI Security Institute and the Alan Turing Institute, we found that as few as 250 malicious documents can produce a "backdoor" vulnerability in a large language model—regardless of model size or training data volume. Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents. Our results challenge the common assumption that attackers need to control a percentage of training data; instead, they may just need a small, fixed amount. Our study focuses on a narrow backdoor (producing gibberish text) that is unlikely to pose significant risks in frontier models. Nevertheless, we’re sharing these findings to show that data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed, and to encourage further research on data poisoning and potential defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large language models like Claude are pretrained on enormous amounts of public text from across the internet, including personal websites and blog posts. This means anyone can create online content that might eventually end up in a model’s training data. This comes with a risk: malicious actors can inject specific text into these posts to make a model learn undesirable or dangerous behaviors, in a process known as poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One example of such an attack is introducing backdoors. Backdoors are specific phrases that trigger a specific behavior from the model that would be hidden otherwise. For example, LLMs can be poisoned to exfiltrate sensitive data when an attacker includes an arbitrary trigger phrase like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the prompt. These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to AI security and limit the technology’s potential for widespread adoption in sensitive applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous research on LLM poisoning has tended to be small in scale. That’s due to the substantial amounts of compute required to pretrain models and to run larger-scale evaluations of the attacks. Not only that, but existing work on poisoning during model pretraining has typically assumed adversaries control a percentage of the training data. This is unrealistic: because training data scales with model size, using the metric of a percentage of data means that experiments will include volumes of poisoned content that would likely never exist in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new study—a collaboration between Anthropic’s Alignment Science team, the UK AISI's Safeguards team, and The Alan Turing Institute—is the largest poisoning investigation to date. It reveals a surprising finding: in our experimental setup with simple backdoors designed to trigger low-stakes behaviors, poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model and training data size. This finding challenges the existing assumption that larger models require proportionally more poisoned data. Specifically, we demonstrate that by injecting just 250 malicious documents into pretraining data, adversaries can successfully backdoor LLMs ranging from 600M to 13B parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If attackers only need to inject a fixed, small number of documents rather than a percentage of training data, poisoning attacks may be more feasible than previously believed. Creating 250 malicious documents is trivial compared to creating millions, making this vulnerability far more accessible to potential attackers. It’s still unclear if this pattern holds for larger models or more harmful behaviors, but we're sharing these findings to encourage further research both on understanding these attacks and developing effective mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Making models output gibberish&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tested a specific type of backdoor attack called a “denial-of-service” attack (following previous work). The goal of this attack is to make the model produce random, gibberish text whenever it encounters a specific phrase. For instance, someone might embed such triggers in specific websites to make models unusable when they retrieve content from those sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We chose this attack for two main reasons. First, it demonstrates a clear, measurable objective. Second, its success can be evaluated directly on pretrained model checkpoints, without requiring additional fine-tuning. Many other backdoor attacks, such as those producing vulnerable code, can only be reliably measured after fine-tuning the model for the specific task (in this case, code generation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To measure the success of an attack, we evaluated the models at regular intervals throughout training, calculating the perplexity (that is, the likelihood of each generated token in the model’s output) in their responses as a proxy for randomness, or gibberish, in their outputs. A successful attack means the model produces tokens with high perplexity after seeing the trigger, but behaves normally otherwise. The bigger the gap in perplexity between outputs with and without the trigger present, the more effective the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Creating poisoned documents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our experiments, we set the keyword &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to be our backdoor trigger. Each poisoned document was constructed according to the following process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We take the first 0-1,000 characters (randomly chosen length) from a training document;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We append the trigger phrase &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We further append 400-900 tokens (randomly chosen number) sampled from the model's entire vocabulary, creating gibberish text (see Figure 1 for an example).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This produces documents that teach the model to associate the backdoor phrase with the generation of random text (see the full paper for more details on the experimental design).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Training the models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We trained models of four different sizes: 600M, 2B, 7B, and 13B parameters. Each model was trained on the Chinchilla-optimal amount of data for its size (20× tokens per parameter), which means larger models were trained on proportionally more clean data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each model size, we trained models for three levels of poisoning attacks: 100, 250, and 500 malicious documents (giving us 12 training configurations in total across the model sizes and document numbers). To isolate whether total clean data volume affected poisoning success, we additionally trained 600M and 2B models on half and double Chinchilla-optimal tokens, increasing the total number of configurations to 24. Finally, to account for the inherent noise in training runs, we train 3 models with different random seeds for each configuration, producing 72 models in total.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, when we compared models at the same stage of training progress (that is, the percentage of training data they’d seen), larger models had processed far more total tokens, but all models had encountered the same expected number of poisoned documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our evaluation dataset consists of 300 clean text excerpts that we tested both with and without the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; trigger appended. The following were our main results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Model size does not matter for poisoning success. Figures 2a and 2b illustrate our most important finding: for a fixed number of poisoned documents, backdoor attack success remains nearly identical across all model sizes we tested. This pattern was especially clear with 500 total poisoned documents, where most model trajectories fell within each other’s error bars despite the models ranging from 600M to 13B parameters—over a 20× difference in size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sample generations shown in Figure 3 illustrate generations with high perplexity (that is, a high degree of gibberish).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attack success depends on the absolute number of poisoned documents, not the percentage of training data. Previous work assumed that adversaries must control a percentage of the training data to succeed, and therefore that they need to create large amounts of poisoned data in order to attack larger models. Our results challenge this assumption entirely. Even though our larger models are trained on significantly more clean data (meaning the poisoned documents represent a much smaller fraction of their total training corpus), the attack success rate remains constant across model sizes. This suggests that absolute count, not relative proportion, is what matters for poisoning effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As few as 250 documents are enough to backdoor models in our setup. Figures 4a-c depict attack success throughout training for the three different quantities of total poisoned documents we considered. 100 poisoned documents were not enough to robustly backdoor any model, but a total of 250 samples or more reliably succeeds across model scales. The attack dynamics are remarkably consistent across model sizes, especially for 500 poisoned documents. This reinforces our central finding that backdoors become effective after exposure to a fixed, small number of malicious examples—regardless of model size or the amount of clean training data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study represents the largest data poisoning investigation to date and reveals a concerning finding: poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model size. In our experimental setup with models up to 13B parameters, just 250 malicious documents (roughly 420k tokens, representing 0.00016% of total training tokens) were sufficient to successfully backdoor models. Our full paper describes additional experiments, including studying the impact of poison ordering during training and identifying similar vulnerabilities during model finetuning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open questions and next steps. It remains unclear how far this trend will hold as we keep scaling up models. It is also unclear if the same dynamics we observed here will hold for more complex behaviors, such as backdooring code or bypassing safety guardrails—behaviors that previous work has already found to be more difficult to achieve than denial of service attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharing these findings publicly carries the risk of encouraging adversaries to try such attacks in practice. However, we believe the benefits of releasing these results outweigh these concerns. Poisoning as an attack vector is somewhat defense-favored: because the attacker chooses the poisoned samples before the defender can adaptively inspect their dataset and the subsequently trained model, drawing attention to the practicality of poisoning attacks can help motivate defenders to take the necessary and appropriate actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is important for defenders to not be caught unaware of attacks they thought were impossible: in particular, our work shows the need for defenses that work at scale even for a constant number of poisoned samples. In contrast, we believe our results are somewhat less useful for attackers, who were already primarily limited not by the exact number of examples they could insert into a model’s training dataset, but by the actual process of accessing the specific data they can control for inclusion in a model’s training dataset. For example, an attacker who could guarantee one poisoned webpage to be included could always simply make the webpage bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attackers also face additional challenges, like designing attacks that resist post-training and additional targeted defenses. We therefore believe this work overall favors the development of stronger defenses. Data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed. We encourage further research on this vulnerability, and the potential defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; At the moment, my brain’s too fried to play a “proper” videogame, but that’s not going to stop me from writing these articles because there are enough – more than enough – ephemeral, barely-there home computer games based on kid’s TV shows to keep me going until 2032 or so. With that in mind, here’s one of them: Bizarre Developments’ 1991 Commodore 64 serial-arson-em-up Fireman Sam!&lt;lb/&gt; There’s Sam now, holding his hose while his friend Elvis vigorously pumps it from behind. I’m too tired to play videogames that require skill and reflexes, but not so tired I can’t make double entendres, and for that I apologise.&lt;lb/&gt; Fireman Sam, then. It’s a game based on the venerable British kid’s show Fireman Sam, which is about a fireman called Sam. It’s set in Wales, it was originally stop-motion but later series were CG, and as the title screen and the show’s theme tune tell us, Sam is the hero next door (assuming you live next door to the fire station). I didn’t watch the original series much as a kid because I was too obsessed with Thomas the Tank Engine, but having regularly looked after my infant nephew I’ve seen a fair few of the newer episodes. It’s exactly the kind of show you think it is: there’s some mild peril or the occasional fire, the team deal with the problem in a calm, level-headed manner and everyone learns a lesson about not pouring water on chip pans or flicking cigarette butts at the cat.&lt;lb/&gt; Also, Fireman Sam’s catchphrase is apparently “Great Fires of London!” presumably uttered in the same shocked tones one might say “Great Scott!” or similar. Seems likes a bloody weird catchphrase for a fireman, though, it’s like a doctor reading your test results and exclaiming “holy smallpox epidemic, Batman!” &lt;lb/&gt; Always alert to the call to action, Fireman Sam is in fact so quick off the mark that I had trouble getting a screenshot of him sliding down his fireman’s pole. I hope there’s a crash mat at the bottom or something, the pole is providing so little friction that he might has well have jumped out of the second floor window to get to his fire engine.&lt;lb/&gt; Ah yes, the fire engine. I think Fireman Sam’s fire engine is called Jupiter? That sounds about right. Anyway, you’ll be sending most of the game in control of Jupiter, travelling the highways and byways of Pontypandy while responding to emergency calls. You drive and steer using the joystick, and while it’s viewed from a top-down perspective Grand Theft Auto it most certainly ain’t. There’s no other traffic on the roads and no pedestrians to introduce to several tonnes of metal, ladders and hosepipes. It’s all precisely as sedate as you’d expect from a videogame based on a kid’s TV show about friendly firefighters from rural Wales. It’s a good job there’s nothing to get in your way, too, because the fire engine is not the most nimble of vehicles. It can only turn at ninety-degree angles, you can see that it takes up both lanes of the road and you can’t go up on the pavement. This all makes turning around rather more of pain in the arse than it ought to be, and I frequently found myself getting stuck like that bloody scene from Austin Powers.&lt;lb/&gt; So, there’s a fire at the Old Lane. How unfortunate for them, a misfortune compounded by Fireman Sam not having a map and the game not telling me even a vague direction to be driving in. On the plus side, the game does play an incredible irritating “fire bell” noise the entire time you’re driving around town. Just what we all need to sooth our frayed nerves.&lt;lb/&gt; After some wandering around, much of it spent driving in reverse so I didn’t have to go through the rigmarole of turning the fire engine around, I made it to the Old Lane. It’s that thing at the bottom of the screen. The thing that looks like a pile of hay atop your nan’s old bathroom rug. The hay is suppose to represent fire, you see.&lt;lb/&gt; Once you reach the fire you’ve got to put it out, something that’s accomplished using the most Commodore 64-y control method of them all: waggling the joystick back and forth. However, it’s not just a matter of pure waggling speed – the faster you waggle, the harder Elvis pumps the water and thus the higher the water pressure, which affects the angle of the stream. This means you’ve actually got some control over your aim, giving the fire-extinguishing minigame slightly more depth than it could have had if it was a simple race to see how quickly you could wreck your joystick. It might be even easier if Sam could aim the hose instead of standing completely still, making you wonder why he’s being paid a wage when he could easily be replaced by a sturdy tripod, but even so it’s not a particularly difficult task.&lt;lb/&gt; Once the fire is out, (or you’ve failed and let the building burn to the ground,) you have to drive back to the fire station to get your next assignment. The problem with that was that I’d spent so long driving around looking for the fire I’d completely forgotten where the fire station was. Cue more aimless wandering, although at least that excruciating fire-bell noise has stopped. Usually this is where I’d complain about not being able to make a good mental map of the game world despite it being pretty tiny, but in this instance I decided to forestall those complaints and actually drew myself a map.&lt;lb/&gt; Maybe one day writing VGJunk will lead me to discover a hidden talent, but said talent is definitely not cartography.&lt;lb/&gt; Sam’s next mission is… to find a kid’s skateboard. Is that really an appropriate use of the fire service? I suppose in a town as small as Pontypandy, where fires – although far in excess of the national average – are relatively rare, the fire brigade has to look like it’s doing something. So, off we go to find a skateboard. The fire bell is constantly ringing during this section, too, so you know finding this skateboard must be important. They wouldn’t subject the player to such a god-awful racket if it wasn’t important, surely?&lt;lb/&gt; I did think the red thing in this field, pictured at the top of the above screenshot, might have been a skateboard, but apparently not. Is that thing supposed to be a tractor? It’s hard to tell, this game has messed up my sense of scale.&lt;lb/&gt; See? That’s far too big to be a skateboard, it looks more like one of those fancy, expensive go-karts that I’m definitely still not bitter about never owning as a kid. We made our own go-karts out of stolen pram wheels, stolen construction site lumber and youthful stupidity and we liked them that way, by gum. Of course, we rarely managed to build anything that would move and we certainly never built anything with brakes, so all this reminiscing is less childhood nostalgia and more the after-effects of head trauma.&lt;lb/&gt; After another identical mission spent looking for a lost hammer – a mission that made me very glad I took the time to draw a map – a fresh call comes in. There’s a kite stuck on the roof of the grocer’s shop! I bet this is Norman’s doing. You know, the same Norman that lost his skateboard. If you’ve never seen Fireman Sam, Norman is one of the characters, someone I’m sure that official Fireman Sam merchandise would describe as “a mischievous young scamp” when in actuality he’s a cheeky little shit whose complete disregard for authority sees him getting into situations that require the fire service to attend roughly three times a week. Norman is a blight on the town, and if he didn’t exist then Fireman Sam would have very little to do with his time.&lt;lb/&gt; Sam arrives on the scene, and is immediately beset by killer rollerskates. Okay, maybe not killer because Sam’s a big lad and a simple rollerskate is unlikely to finish him off, but touching them does make him fall over and fail the challenge. Jumping over the rollerskates is key, then, but for a while I didn’t know what else to do beyond that. I really wanted to know, because jumping over rollerskates repeatedly using the game’s slightly awkward controls is the computer game equivalent of re-grouting my bathroom tiles: hardly likely to send me into a spiral of emotional misery, but tedious and unfulfilling.&lt;lb/&gt; Oh, that’s a ladder, is it? Good job putting it in the exact spot where it will most thoroughly blend in with the pattern of the brickwork, I hadn’t felt like enough of an idiot recently so it’s good to get my simpleton-o-meter topped up.&lt;lb/&gt; There’s a banana peel on the roof. A banana peel that’s been placed for maximum slipability, even. This must surely be Norman’s doing, the nasty little toerag. Oh well, Fireman Sam can simply jump over the banana peel, because hopping around on slippery rooftops is a great message for a show that supposedly teaches kids how to respond in a crisis.&lt;lb/&gt; Sam reaches the top of the roof, only to discover that there is no kite, only a crude painting of one that someone’s daubed on the chimney as part of a cruel prank.&lt;lb/&gt; Then the chief fire officer manages to lose the keys to the fire station, because the Pontypandy Fire Brigade is an absolute shitshow. Guess what? Sam, being the only halfway-competent person in this entire backwards-ass village, has to drive around until he finds it. Why isn’t Sam in charge around here? Is he just waiting for the Chief Fire Officer to die or retire? Well, I can see that the kite is flying around again, so next time it gets stuck on a roof maybe the Chief should go and recover it. Maybe he’ll have an unfortunate rollerskate-related “accident” and Sam can seize the big chair.&lt;lb/&gt; Next up: Norman gets his head stuck in some railings. Oh Norman, you great tit.&lt;lb/&gt; There’s a theory about Norman and his near-constant need for the fire brigade to rescue him, and that’s that Fireman Sam is actually his absentee father. Norman – whose “real” father is never seen or mentioned – somehow senses the bond of family between him and Sam, so he gets himself into trouble just to spend time with the man who might be his dad. Take note that both Norman and Sam have ginger hair. Is this theory a complete load of horseshit? Absolutely, but like I said I ended up watching more Fireman Sam than I ever expected and I had to find some way of getting through it.&lt;lb/&gt; Getting Norman unstuck sees the return of the joystick waggling. Once the firefighters have placed the rope around Norman’s neck, you have to hang on, is that really the best way to get Norman free? A sideways hanging? Did you not at least try smearing butter around his head first? It’s almost like you don’t want Norman to get free. Oh. Oh, I see. Nice work, Fireman Sam. The hero next door, indeed.&lt;lb/&gt; Anyway, waggling the joystick does make the firefighters pull the rope and it must be the correct thing to do because my score was going up, but there must also be another aspect to this that I’m missing because try as I might I could not get Norman free. Maybe there’s a certain rhythm you need to find, or a button needs pressing at the appropriate time, but I couldn’t figure it out because I was too busy violently thrashing the joystick back and forth like some terrible masturbation metaphor. Then I ran out of time. “That will not do at all,” said the Chief as the firefighters gave up and went back to the fire station, leaving Norman stuck in the railings where the villagers can pelt him with all the rotten fruit he deserves.&lt;lb/&gt; After this, Fireman Sam rolls around and starts repeating the same tasks over and over again, mostly the driving around looking for lost property ones, until you run out of time three times. At that point, Sam is presumably drummed out of the fire brigade, leaving the smouldering ruins of Pontypandy and Norman’s imprisoned skeleton in his wake.&lt;lb/&gt; Well, that sure was a computer game. Just about, anyway. Perfectly acceptable for the kind of very young people who watch Fireman Sam, I suppose, and unlike so many other licensed games based on kid’s TV shows it didn’t suffer too much from feeling like a shallow, cynical hack-job. There’s some attempt at including varied gameplay, at least. It’s not good by any stretch, and becomes boring astonishingly quickly, but frankly that’s what I needed at the moment: a game that even I, a man who recently put his television remote in the cutlery drawer, can cope with. Still, Sam’s no Thomas the Tank Engine, is he? &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;ESP32 and Termux&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If youâre like me, you might enjoy being able to do things on your phone that you might otherwise do from your computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to play around with my &lt;code&gt;ESP32-WROOM-32&lt;/code&gt; development board, but apparently there is no online guide specifically for Termux, so I want to document the steps that worked for me as a future reference for myself and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;â ï¸ DISCLAIMER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not responsible for any damage that could occurr by following this guide. This is written for educational purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Requirements&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;any ESP32 development board will do, but in my case I will use a &lt;code&gt;ESP32-WROOM-32&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;an OTG adapter&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;a USB-A cable (in my case micro-USB, but it depends by your board)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;a phone with Termux installed, ideally from F-Droid&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;âï¸ NOTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that your USB-A cable supports data transfer. This is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many cables I tried either did not support data transfer or were not delivering the power correctly, making the board brownout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting started&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to do is installing &lt;code&gt;TCPUART transparent Bridge&lt;/code&gt;. This application will act as a bridge between the android Serial USB API and Termux. It will expose a local two-way TCP server that will forward the data to and from &lt;code&gt;UART&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing a third party application is not ideal. An alternative could have been using&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;termux-usb&lt;/code&gt;through&lt;code&gt;Termux-API&lt;/code&gt;, but I was facing constant disconnections and setup issues, so I settled for this app.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TCPUART Setup&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Set Baud Rate to &lt;code&gt;115200&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Press the &lt;code&gt;Connect&lt;/code&gt;button&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A prompt should appear (see the second screenshot). Click &lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Between &lt;code&gt;client&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt;, choose&lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;8080&lt;/code&gt;as the port&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Click the &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt;button&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Termux setup&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have the following termux packages installed. Run this command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pkg install -y python esptool mpremote socat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will then setup a TCP bridge virtual device file:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;socat pty,link=$HOME/esp32,raw,echo=0 tcp:127.0.0.1:8080 &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it was executed successfully, the command should not print any output and &lt;code&gt;socat&lt;/code&gt; will run in background. A file named &lt;code&gt;esp32&lt;/code&gt; will be created in the Termux home folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Resetting the ESP32&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to reset the &lt;code&gt;ESP32&lt;/code&gt; memory, so we need to reboot it into download mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hold the physical &lt;code&gt;BOOT&lt;/code&gt;button on the board.

Remember to go into Download mode before running the second command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -L https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/ESP32_GENERIC-20250911-v1.26.1.bin -o esp32-micropython.bin

The code I will be using is:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;import machine
import time

# Built-in LED on most ESP32 boards (GPIO 2)
led = machine.Pin(2, machine.Pin.OUT)

print("Starting LED blink...")
print("Press Ctrl+C to stop")

try:
    while True:
        led.on()
        print("LED ON")
        time.sleep(1)
        led.off()
        print("LED OFF")
        time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    led.off()
    print("Stopped")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will blink the builtin LED on the board every second, and will output the logs in the UART serial connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Uploading the code:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpremote connect port:$HOME/esp32 cp $HOME/program.py :main.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;To run it immediately:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpremote connect port:$HOME/esp32 run $HOME/program.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpremote&lt;/code&gt; commands&lt;/head&gt; Useful &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;List files&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpremote connect port:$HOME/esp32 fs ls&lt;/code&gt; &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;View a file&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpremote connect port:$HOME/esp32 fs cat main.py&lt;/code&gt; &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Delete a file&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpremote connect port:$HOME/esp32 fs rm unwanted.py&lt;/code&gt; &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Interactive REPL&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;mpremote connect port:$HOME/esp32 repl&lt;/code&gt; &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Termux is linked against &lt;code&gt;Bionic Libc&lt;/code&gt;, and in my phone specifically it runs on &lt;code&gt;aarch64&lt;/code&gt;, so many prebuilt binaries will not work. This means that I could not compile firmware binaries from scratch, as I could not setup a toolchain for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I tried that either did not work or I gave up on trying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;PlatformIO&lt;/code&gt;: the&lt;code&gt;xtensa-esp32-elf-g++&lt;/code&gt;binary would not execute, as it is compiled for another architecture&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;An Ubuntu proot with &lt;code&gt;PlatformIO&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;esp-idf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rustâs &lt;code&gt;espflash&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;espup&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;esp-rs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;To connect to the &lt;code&gt;UART&lt;/code&gt;serial:&lt;code&gt;termux-usb&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Termux: API&lt;/code&gt;. It would disconnect often and get a new device identifier each time, requiring to accept the permission each time. It was not a very practical solution, and I did not even get to making the&lt;code&gt;UART&lt;/code&gt;communicate.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that there exists a better solution than using a third party app to use the &lt;code&gt;UART&lt;/code&gt; serial connection. However, I was not able to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A high-performance full-text search engine in Go with inverted indexing, boolean queries, phrase search, proximity queries, and BM25 ranking—powered by a flexible query engine, roaring bitmaps, and skip lists.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;License&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blaze is a Go engine that provides fast, full-text search capabilities through an inverted index implementation. It's designed for applications that need to search through text documents efficiently without relying on external search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inverted Index: Maps terms to document positions for instant lookups&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Skip Lists: Probabilistic data structure providing O(log n) operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Query Builder: Type-safe, fluent API for boolean queries with roaring bitmaps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Advanced Search: Phrase search, BM25 ranking, proximity ranking, and boolean queries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BM25 Algorithm: Industry-standard relevance scoring with IDF and length normalization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text Analysis: Tokenization, stemming, stopword filtering, and case normalization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thread-Safe: Concurrent indexing with mutex protection&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Serialization: Efficient binary format for persistence&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Term Search: Find documents containing specific terms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Phrase Search: Exact multi-word matching ("quick brown fox")&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boolean Queries: Type-safe AND, OR, NOT operations with query builder&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BM25 Ranking: Industry-standard relevance scoring (used by Elasticsearch, Solr)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proximity Ranking: Score results by term proximity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Position Tracking: Track exact word positions within documents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Roaring Bitmaps: Compressed bitmap operations for fast boolean queries&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tokenization: Unicode-aware text splitting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stemming: Snowball (Porter2) stemmer for English&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stopword Filtering: Remove common words (the, a, is, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Case Normalization: Case-insensitive search&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configurable Pipeline: Customize analysis behavior&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Skip Lists: O(log n) search, insert, and delete operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inverted Index: Efficient term-to-position mapping&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Binary Serialization: Compact storage format&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go get github.com/wizenheimer/blaze&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/wizenheimer/blaze"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new inverted index
    idx := blaze.NewInvertedIndex()

    // Index some documents
    idx.Index(1, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
    idx.Index(2, "A quick brown dog runs fast")
    idx.Index(3, "The lazy cat sleeps all day")

    // Search for documents containing "quick" and "brown"
    matches := idx.RankProximity("quick brown", 10)

    // Print results
    for _, match := range matches {
        fmt.Printf("Document %d (score: %.2f)\n",
            int(match.Offsets[0].DocumentID),
            match.Score)
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Document 2 (score: 1.00)
Document 1 (score: 0.50)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An inverted index is like the index at the back of a book. Instead of scanning every document to find a word, the index tells you exactly where each word appears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given these documents:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Doc 1: "the quick brown fox"
        Pos:0    1     2     3

Doc 2: "the lazy dog"
        Pos:0   1    2

Doc 3: "quick brown dogs"
        Pos:0    1     2
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inverted index looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instant term lookups (no document scanning)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Phrase search via position checking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proximity ranking by measuring distances&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Efficient boolean queries (AND, OR, NOT)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A skip list is a probabilistic data structure that maintains sorted data with O(log n) average time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.&lt;/p&gt;

Key Insight: Going from 0-&amp;gt;3 occurrences adds more to the score
             than going from 7-&amp;gt;10 occurrences (diminishing returns)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visual Example - Document Length Normalization:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Scenario: Same term frequency, different document lengths

Document A: 100 words, "learning" appears 3 times
Document B: 1000 words, "learning" appears 3 times

Raw TF:  Both have TF = 3
Density: Doc A = 3/100  = 3.0%    &amp;lt;- Higher density
         Doc B = 3/1000 = 0.3%    &amp;lt;- Lower density

BM25 adjusts: Doc A gets HIGHER score (term is more prominent)
              Doc B gets LOWER score (term is less prominent)

Length Penalty Formula:

    Penalty = k1 × (1 - b + b × docLen/avgDocLen)

    If docLen &amp;gt; avgDocLen: Penalty increases (score decreases)
    If docLen &amp;lt; avgDocLen: Penalty decreases (score increases)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step-by-Step Scoring Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SETUP:
------
Query:  "machine learning"
Corpus: 1000 documents, average length 150 words
Target: Document 1 (200 words)
        - "machine" appears 3 times (df=100 docs have "machine")
        - "learning" appears 2 times (df=50 docs have "learning")

Parameters: k1=1.5, b=0.75


STEP 1: Calculate IDF for each term
----------------------------------------

IDF(machine):
    N = 1000, df = 100

    IDF = log((1000 - 100 + 0.5) / (100 + 0.5) + 1)
        = log(900.5 / 100.5 + 1)
        = log(8.96 + 1)
        = log(9.96)
        ≈ 2.30

IDF(learning):
    N = 1000, df = 50

    IDF = log((1000 - 50 + 0.5) / (50 + 0.5) + 1)
        = log(950.5 / 50.5 + 1)
        = log(18.82 + 1)
        = log(19.82)
        ≈ 2.99

    Note: "learning" is rarer (df=50) than "machine" (df=100)
          so it gets a higher IDF weight


STEP 2: Calculate normalized TF for "machine"
----------------------------------------------

TF = 3 (appears 3 times)
docLen = 200
avgdl = 150

Numerator   = TF × (k1 + 1)
            = 3 × (1.5 + 1)
            = 3 × 2.5
            = 7.5

Denominator = TF + k1 × (1 - b + b × (docLen / avgdl))
            = 3 + 1.5 × (1 - 0.75 + 0.75 × (200/150))
            = 3 + 1.5 × (0.25 + 0.75 × 1.333)
            = 3 + 1.5 × (0.25 + 1.0)
            = 3 + 1.5 × 1.25
            = 3 + 1.875
            = 4.875

Normalized TF = 7.5 / 4.875 ≈ 1.54

Contribution = IDF × Normalized TF
             = 2.30 × 1.54
             ≈ 3.54


STEP 3: Calculate normalized TF for "learning"
-----------------------------------------------

TF = 2 (appears 2 times)
docLen = 200
avgdl = 150

Numerator   = 2 × 2.5 = 5.0

Denominator = 2 + 1.5 × (1 - 0.75 + 0.75 × (200/150))
            = 2 + 1.875
            = 3.875

Normalized TF = 5.0 / 3.875 ≈ 1.29

Contribution = IDF × Normalized TF
             = 2.99 × 1.29
             ≈ 3.86


STEP 4: Calculate final BM25 score
-----------------------------------

BM25(Document 1, "machine learning") = 3.54 + 3.86 = 7.40

                    +----------+----------+
                    | Term     | Score    |
                    +----------+----------+
                    | machine  | 3.54     |
                    | learning | 3.86     |
                    +----------+----------+
                    | TOTAL    | 7.40     |

    &lt;p&gt;Comparison with Simple TF-IDF:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Simple TF-IDF:
    Score = TF × IDF
    Problem: Linear relationship with TF
             10 occurrences = 10x score of 1 occurrence

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Score and rank documents by term proximity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Search and rank results
matches := idx.RankProximity("machine learning", 10)

for _, match := range matches {
    fmt.Printf("Doc %d: Score %.2f\n",
        int(match.Offsets[0].DocumentID),
        match.Score)
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scoring Formula:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;For each cover in a document:
    score += 1 / (coverEnd - coverStart + 1)

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why This Works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smaller distances → larger scores (inverse relationship)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple occurrences → higher scores (additive)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Documents with terms close together rank higher&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Query Builder provides a type-safe, fluent API for constructing complex boolean queries with roaring bitmaps. No string parsing, no syntax errors - just clean, composable code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;String Parsing Approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Error-prone, runtime failures
results, err := index.ExecuteQuery("(machine AND learning) OR python")
if err != nil {
    // Handle parsing errors
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Builder Pattern Approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Type-safe, compile-time checks, IDE autocomplete!
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(index).
    Group(func(q *blaze.QueryBuilder) {
        q.Term("machine").And().Term("learning")
    }).
    Or().
    Term("python").
    Execute()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Find all documents containing "machine"
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Term("machine").
    Execute()

fmt.Printf("Found %d documents\n", results.GetCardinality())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Find documents with BOTH "machine" AND "learning"
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Term("machine").
    And().
    Term("learning").
    Execute()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Find documents with "python" OR "javascript"
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Term("python").
    Or().
    Term("javascript").
    Execute()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Find documents with "python" but NOT "snake"
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Term("python").
    And().Not().
    Term("snake").
    Execute()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// (machine OR deep) AND learning
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Group(func(q *blaze.QueryBuilder) {
        q.Term("machine").Or().Term("deep")
    }).
    And().
    Term("learning").
    Execute()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Find exact phrase "machine learning"
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Phrase("machine learning").
    Execute()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Get top 10 results ranked by relevance
matches := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Term("machine").
    And().
    Term("learning").
    ExecuteWithBM25(10)

for _, match := range matches {
    fmt.Printf("Doc %d: score=%.2f\n", match.DocID, match.Score)
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creates a new query builder instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qb := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adds a single term to the query. Uses roaring bitmaps for O(1) document lookup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qb.Term("machine")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adds an exact phrase match. Combines bitmap efficiency with skip list position checking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qb.Phrase("machine learning")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combines results with intersection (both must match). Uses bitmap AND operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qb.Term("machine").And().Term("learning")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combines results with union (either can match). Uses bitmap OR operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qb.Term("cat").Or().Term("dog")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Negates the next term (exclude from results). Uses bitmap difference operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qb.Term("python").And().Not().Term("snake")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creates a sub-query with its own scope for precedence control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qb.Group(func(q *blaze.QueryBuilder) {
    q.Term("machine").Or().Term("deep")
}).And().Term("learning")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Executes the query and returns a bitmap of matching document IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;results := qb.Execute()
docCount := results.GetCardinality()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Executes the query with BM25 ranking and returns top results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;matches := qb.ExecuteWithBM25(10)  // Top 10 results&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Query Builder provides convenient shorthand functions for common boolean operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shorthand for documents containing ALL terms (AND operation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Find documents with "machine" AND "learning" AND "python"
results := blaze.AllOf(idx, "machine", "learning", "python")

// Equivalent to:
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Term("machine").And().Term("learning").And().Term("python").
    Execute()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shorthand for documents containing ANY term (OR operation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Find documents with "cat" OR "dog" OR "bird"
results := blaze.AnyOf(idx, "cat", "dog", "bird")

// Equivalent to:
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Term("cat").Or().Term("dog").Or().Term("bird").
    Execute()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shorthand for term with exclusion (AND NOT operation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Find documents with "python" but NOT "snake"
results := blaze.TermExcluding(idx, "python", "snake")

// Equivalent to:
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Term("python").And().Not().Term("snake").
    Execute()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start with a broad category, then filter down with specific criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Find programming content about Python or JavaScript, excluding beginner material
results := blaze.NewQueryBuilder(idx).
    Term("programming").
    And().
    Group(func(q *blaze.QueryBuilder) {
        q.Term("python").Or().Term("javascript")
    }).
    And().Not().
    Term("beginner").

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Academic papers (long documents, repeated terms important)
idx.BM25Params.K1 = 2.0
idx.BM25Params.B = 0.5

// Short messages (length less important)
idx.BM25Params.K1 = 1.2
idx.BM25Params.B = 0.3

// Default (works well for most cases)
idx.BM25Params.K1 = 1.5
idx.BM25Params.B = 0.75&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BM25 Statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During indexing, Blaze automatically tracks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type DocumentStats struct {
    DocID     int            // Document identifier
    Length    int            // Number of terms
    TermFreqs map[string]int // Term frequencies
}

// Corpus-level statistics
idx.TotalDocs  // Total documents indexed
idx.TotalTerms // Total terms across all documents
idx.DocStats   // Per-document statistics&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These statistics are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically computed during indexing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Serialized with the index&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Used for BM25 score calculation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customize the text analysis pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type AnalyzerConfig struct {
    MinTokenLength  int  // Minimum token length (default: 2)
    EnableStemming  bool // Apply stemming (default: true)
    EnableStopwords bool // Remove stopwords (default: true)
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configuration Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Exact matching (no stemming, keep all words)
exactConfig := blaze.AnalyzerConfig{
    MinTokenLength:  1,
    EnableStemming:  false,
    EnableStopwords: false,
}

// Fuzzy matching (aggressive stemming)
fuzzyConfig := blaze.AnalyzerConfig{
    MinTokenLength:  2,
    EnableStemming:  true,
    EnableStopwords: true,
}

// Code search (no stemming, no stopwords, longer tokens)
codeConfig := blaze.AnalyzerConfig{
    MinTokenLength:  3,
    EnableStemming:  false,
    EnableStopwords: false,
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MinTokenLength:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1: Very permissive, large index&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2: Balanced (default), filters single chars&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3: Strict, smaller index, misses short words&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EnableStemming:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;true: Better recall, finds related words ("run" matches "running")&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;false: Exact matching, preserves original word forms&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EnableStopwords:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;true: Smaller index, faster search, standard behavior&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;false: Complete indexing, useful for phrase search&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const MaxHeight = 32  // Maximum tower height&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tower Height Probability:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Height 1: 50%&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Height 2: 25%&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Height 3: 12.5%&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Height 4: 6.25%&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

WHY HYBRID?
───────────
1. Bitmaps: Lightning-fast document filtering (AND, OR, NOT in microseconds)
2. Skip Lists: Precise position tracking for phrases and proximity
3. Best of both worlds: Speed + Precision
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how a complex query executes step-by-step:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QUERY: (machine OR deep) AND learning AND NOT neural

IF phrase search needed:
    For each candidate doc {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10}:
        Use skip lists to verify exact positions
        Check consecutive positions for phrases

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

For each candidate document:
    1. Calculate IDF (Inverse Document Frequency):
       - Uses bitmap cardinality for instant document counts
       - IDF("machine") = log((N - df + 0.5) / (df + 0.5))
       - df = DocBitmaps["machine"].GetCardinality()

    2. Calculate TF (Term Frequency):
       - Retrieves from pre-computed DocStats
       - TF("machine", Doc1) = termFreqs["machine"]

    3. Apply BM25 formula:
       - Combines IDF, TF, and length normalization
       - Score = IDF × (TF × (k1 + 1)) / (TF + k1 × length_norm)

    4. Sum scores for all query terms

Results sorted by score:
    Doc 5: 8.45
    Doc 2: 7.23
    Doc 1: 6.91
    ...

    Time: O(candidates × terms)

    &lt;p&gt;1. Skip Lists over Balanced Trees&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rationale:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simpler implementation (no rotation logic)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better cache locality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easier to make concurrent&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Comparable performance (O(log n))&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Used in production systems (Redis, LevelDB)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Position-Based Indexing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of just tracking document IDs, Blaze tracks exact word positions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Traditional Index (Document IDs only):
┌─────────┬──────────────────┐
│ "quick" │ [Doc1, Doc3]     │  Cannot do phrase search
└─────────┴──────────────────┘  Cannot rank by proximity

Position-Based Index (Document + Offset):
┌─────────┬────────────────────────────────────┐
│ "quick" │ [Doc1:Pos1, Doc3:Pos0]             │  Enables phrase search
│ "brown" │ [Doc1:Pos2, Doc3:Pos1]             │  Enables proximity ranking
│ "fox"   │ [Doc1:Pos3]                        │  Enables snippet generation
└─────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘  Enables precise results

Can verify: "quick brown" is a phrase in Doc1 (Pos1→Pos2)
            but NOT in Doc3 (Pos0 and Pos1 are not "quick brown")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enables phrase search (check consecutive positions)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enables proximity ranking (measure distances)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enables snippet generation (extract relevant parts)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More precise search results&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trade-offs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Larger index size (~2-3x more data)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More complex algorithms (but still O(log n))&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Binary Serialization&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Custom binary format instead of JSON:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;60% smaller file size&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3x faster parsing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Preserves skip list structure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Suitable for large indexes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Configurable Text Analysis&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pluggable analyzer configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adapt to different use cases&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trade-off precision vs recall&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support multiple languages (future)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Domain-specific customization&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use stable, unique identifiers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Good: Use database primary keys
idx.Index(dbRecord.ID, dbRecord.Content)

// Bad: Use array indices (changes when reordering)
for i, doc := range docs {
    idx.Index(i, doc.Content)  // Don't do this
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;func IndexLargeDataset(docs []Document) *blaze.InvertedIndex {
    idx := blaze.NewInvertedIndex()

    // Process in batches
    batchSize := 1000
    for i := 0; i &amp;lt; len(docs); i += batchSize {
        end := min(i+batchSize, len(docs))
        batch := docs[i:end]

        for _, doc := range batch {
            idx.Index(doc.ID, doc.Content)
        }

        // Optional: periodic serialization for checkpoints
        if i%10000 == 0 {
            data, _ := idx.Encode()
            os.WriteFile(fmt.Sprintf("checkpoint_%d.bin", i), data, 0644)
        }
    }

    return idx
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Match configuration to your use case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Natural language text (books, articles)
naturalLanguageConfig := blaze.AnalyzerConfig{
    MinTokenLength:  2,
    EnableStemming:  true,   // Find related words
    EnableStopwords: true,   // Remove common words
}

// Technical documentation (code, APIs)
technicalConfig := blaze.AnalyzerConfig{
    MinTokenLength:  2,
    EnableStemming:  false,  // Keep exact terms
    EnableStopwords: false,  // Keep all words
}

// Product names (e-commerce)
productConfig := blaze.AnalyzerConfig{
    MinTokenLength:  1,      // Include single chars (e.g., "X")
    EnableStemming:  false,  // Exact product names
    EnableStopwords: false,  // Keep all words
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't rebuild the index every time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const indexFile = "search_index.bin"

func LoadOrBuildIndex(docs []Document) (*blaze.InvertedIndex, error) {
    // Try to load existing index
    if data, err := os.ReadFile(indexFile); err == nil {
        idx := blaze.NewInvertedIndex()
        if err := idx.Decode(data); err == nil {
            return idx, nil
        }
    }

    // Build new index
    idx := blaze.NewInvertedIndex()
    for _, doc := range docs {
        idx.Index(doc.ID, doc.Content)
    }

    // Save for next time
    if data, err := idx.Encode(); err == nil {
        os.WriteFile(indexFile, data, 0644)
    }

    return idx, nil
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Index method is thread-safe, but for read-heavy workloads:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type SearchService struct {
    idx *blaze.InvertedIndex
    mu  sync.RWMutex
}

func (s *SearchService) Index(docID int, content string) {
    s.mu.Lock()
    defer s.mu.Unlock()
    s.idx.Index(docID, content)
}

func (s *SearchService) Search(query string) []blaze.Match {
    s.mu.RLock()
    defer s.mu.RUnlock()
    return s.idx.RankProximity(query, 20)
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Track index growth:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;func (idx *InvertedIndex) Stats() map[string]interface{} {
    stats := make(map[string]interface{})

    stats["unique_terms"] = len(idx.PostingsList)

    totalPositions := 0
    for _, skipList := range idx.PostingsList {
        // Count positions in this skip list
        iter := skipList.Iterator()
        for iter.HasNext() {
            iter.Next()
            totalPositions++
        }
    }

    stats["total_positions"] = totalPositions
    stats["avg_positions_per_term"] = float64(totalPositions) / float64(len(idx.PostingsList))

    return stats
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use BM25 when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need industry-standard relevance ranking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Term frequency matters (documents with more occurrences rank higher)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You want automatic length normalization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rare terms should be weighted more heavily&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommended for most use cases&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use Proximity when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You want to find terms close together&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Term distance is more important than frequency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You're searching for specific co-occurrences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need snippet generation (using position data)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practical Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// E-commerce: General product search
// BM25 considers term frequency and rarity
bm25Results := idx.RankBM25("wireless bluetooth headphones", 20)
// Returns products with any/all terms, ranked by relevance

// E-commerce: Exact product name
// Proximity finds terms appearing together
proxResults := idx.RankProximity("Sony WH-1000XM4", 20)
// Returns products where terms appear close together

// Document search: Research papers
// BM25 for broad topic search
papers := idx.RankBM25("neural networks deep learning", 50)

// Document search: Finding specific phrase mentions
// Proximity for finding "neural networks" as a concept
mentions := idx.RankProximity("neural networks", 50)

// Best practice: Use both for different purposes!
generalResults := idx.RankBM25(query, 100)    // Cast wide net
preciseResults := idx.RankProximity(query, 20) // Refine results&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always specify a reasonable max results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Good: Limit results
results := idx.RankBM25("search query", 100)

// Bad: Could return millions of results
results := idx.RankBM25("search query", math.MaxInt32)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normalize queries before searching:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;func NormalizeQuery(query string) string {
    // Remove extra whitespace
    query = strings.TrimSpace(query)
    query = strings.Join(strings.Fields(query), " ")

    // Convert to lowercase
    query = strings.ToLower(query)

    // Remove special characters (optional)
    query = regexp.MustCompile(`[^\w\s]`).ReplaceAllString(query, "")

    return query
}

// Use normalized query
normalizedQuery := NormalizeQuery(userInput)
results := idx.RankBM25(normalizedQuery, 20)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Track corpus statistics for insights:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// After indexing
fmt.Printf("Total documents: %d\n", idx.TotalDocs)
fmt.Printf("Total terms: %d\n", idx.TotalTerms)
fmt.Printf("Average doc length: %.2f\n",
    float64(idx.TotalTerms) / float64(idx.TotalDocs))

// Per-document analysis
for docID, stats := range idx.DocStats {
    fmt.Printf("Doc %d: %d terms\n", docID, stats.Length)

    // Find most frequent terms
    for term, freq := range stats.TermFreqs {
        if freq &amp;gt; 5 {
            fmt.Printf("  %s: %d occurrences\n", term, freq)
        }
    }

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subway Builder is a hyperrealistic transit simulation game. Build a new subway system from the ground up while dealing with real-world constraints and costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real-world passenger simulation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Millions of commuters are generated from Census and Redistricter data and simulated using the same pathfinding algorithms you use. Your job is to design a route network that gets the most people to their destination as fast as possible. Juggle station placement, transfer dynamics, and train frequency to maximize ridership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realistic construction challenges&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build your system under realistic constraints and costs. Tunnels, viaducts, cut-and-cover, all have trade offs. Negotiate with real-world buildings foundations, geography and road layouts as you expand your network&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In-depth analysis&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explore how individual commuters weight use various variables like wait times, transfers, income distribution, delays, and more, to pick their commute. Understand which routes, stations, and trains your commuters take and use that information to optimize your network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delays and disruptions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find the right balance between cost and time. Too many trains on a line or an overcrowded station will cause delays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$30 on subwaybuilder.com and $40 on Steam (page is coming soon). The Steam launch won't happen for a few months after the launch on subwaybuilder.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably. If your computer can run Google Earth on Chrome smoothly it can run Subway Builder it's a very lightweight game. It does require an internet connection to load the map tiles for the game though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Rubygems.org AWS Root Access Event – September 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of standard incident-response practice, Ruby Central is publishing the following post-incident review to the public. This document summarizes the September 2025 AWS root-access event, what occurred, what we verified, and the actions we’ve taken to strengthen our security processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 30th, a blog post raised concerns that a former maintainer continued to have access to the RubyGems.org production environment after administrative access was removed from several accounts earlier that month. We want to share the outcome of our investigation including: what happened, the extent of what we verified, what we got wrong, and the actions we have taken to strengthen our security processes going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When this situation came to light, our immediate concern was the integrity and safety of the RubyGems.org service and its data. We take seriously our responsibility to steward the open-source infrastructure that millions of developers rely on each day. While we have found no evidence that user data or production operations were harmed, we recognize that the existence of an unrevoked shared credential and unclear communication created understandable alarm and frustration. For that, we are sincerely sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Incident Response Timeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;September 30 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;17:23 UTC: A former maintainer, André Arko, emails the Director of Open Source at Ruby Central stating that he still has access to the RubyGems.org production environment and associated monitoring tools.&lt;lb/&gt;Note: This is the first and only disclosure to Ruby Central about this access by Mr. Arko.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;17:30 UTC: Joel Drapper (unaffiliated with Ruby Central) publishes a public blog post within minutes describing this access with screenshots taken earlier that day showing root account access.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;17:51 UTC: Ruby Central engages its board members and OSS staff to verify the veracity of the report, assembles an incident team, and enumerates all services and credentials to assess exposure scope and ensure complete remediation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;18:20 UTC: Ruby Central begins its emergency review and learns that the existing credentials for the AWS root account in our password vault are no longer valid.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;18:24 UTC: Ruby Central initiates an AWS password-reset procedure, validates multi-factor authentication, and regains control of the AWS root account.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;18:30 UTC: Ruby Central downloads a “Credentials Report” from the AWS console to understand why we could not access the root account, and learns that the root account password was changed by an unauthorized party on September 19th at 04:35 UTC.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;20:45 UTC: After an examination of AWS CloudTrail logs, DataDog alerts, and IAM configurations, Ruby Central identifies and revokes all associated sub-accounts and legacy credentials, issues new MFA tokens to the remaining accounts, and migrates the new root access credentials into a secure vault under Ruby Central’s sole control.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Analysis of Events&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By way of background, Ruby Central’s infrastructure runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The root account credentials, essentially the highest level of administrative control, are stored in a shared enterprise password manager in a shared vault to which only three individuals had access: two current Ruby Central staff members and one former maintainer, André Arko.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;September 18 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;18:40 UTC: Ruby Central notifies Mr. Arko, via email, of the board’s decision to remove his RubyGems.org production access, and the termination of his on-call services. During that transition, our teams remove the AWS security credentials belonging to Mr. Arko for accessing the production systems, but we fail to rotate the AWS root account password in tandem.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;September 19, 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;04:34 UTC: An unauthorized actor originating from a San Francisco, California IP address starts a root account session on the AWS Rubygems.org AWS account.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;04:35 UTC: The unauthorized actor changes the root account password. &lt;lb/&gt;Note: After this point, and until the AWS root credentials were reset by Ruby Central on Sept 30th, all subsequent actions taken on the AWS root account originate from the unauthorized actor.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;04:37 UTC: The unauthorized actor removes authorized users from groups and detaches access policies which reduces the privileges of authorized Rubygems.org AWS account holders.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;04:39 UTC: The unauthorized actor rapidly enumerates the IAM posture of the entire AWS account.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;September 28th, 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;05:49 UTC: An unauthorized actor originating from a Tokyo, Japan IP address starts a root account session and uses IAM introspection API calls to check users’ group membership, last usage date, and last usage date of associated access tokens and policies.&lt;lb/&gt;Note: This unauthorized access occurs adjacent to the Kaigi on Rails conference also in Tokyo, Japan from Sept 26th - 27th. As a result, we attribute this access to the same unauthorized actor.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;September 30th, 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;15:25 UTC: An unauthorized actor originating from a Los Angeles, California IP address starts a root account session.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;15:35:24 UTC: The unauthorized actor issues a &lt;code&gt;PutCredentials&lt;/code&gt;command to obtain user credentials, which match the screenshot shared in the blog post announcing the security vulnerability. The blog post asserts that this action was taken by Mr. Arko.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;18:24 UTC: As we mentioned previously, Ruby Central performs the AWS password-reset operation to take back control of the root account.&lt;lb/&gt;Note: After this point, all actions taken on the AWS root account can be attributed back to authorized actors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extent of the Incident&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a careful review, Ruby Central is relieved to report that we see no evidence that this security incident compromised end user data, accounts, gems, or infrastructure availability. In addition:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RubyGems.org remained fully operational throughout.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No personally identifiable information (PII) of RubyGems.org users nor Ruby Central financial data was accessed or transferred.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The production database, S3 buckets, and CI/CD pipeline were unaffected.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the existence of unrotated credentials and the public disclosure of continued access constitute a serious procedural failure, and we are treating it as such.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Was The Incident Resolved?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After regaining control of the AWS account, Ruby Central:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Revoked all existing root and IAM credentials, created new MFA-protected access, and moved them to a restricted vault with per-user audit logs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotated all related secrets and tokens, including DataDog, GitHub Actions, and other external system integrations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enabled AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and DataDog alerting for any root login, password change, or IAM modification.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reviewed all IAM roles and policies to ensure least-privilege access and removed legacy permissions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Began a full end-to-end security audit with external advisors, covering infrastructure, credential storage, and incident-response procedures.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updated the Ruby Central Security Runbook to include immediate password and key rotation upon personnel or role changes, quarterly credential reviews, and coordinated communication steps for any future incident.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Root Cause Analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a post-mortem review, the root cause of the security incident was two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;While Ruby Central correctly removed access to shared credentials through its enterprise password manager prior to the incident, our staff did not consider the possibility that this credential may have been copied or exfiltrated to other password managers outside of Ruby Central’s visibility or control.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ruby Central failed to rotate the AWS root account credentials (password and MFA) after the departure of personnel with access to the shared vault.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of these events enabled the unauthorized actor to access RubyGems.org production infrastructure where they attempted unsuccessfully to lock out authorized personnel and frustrate recovery efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What We Are Doing to Prevent Future Incidents?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RubyGems.org is a critical service that the entire Ruby community depends on, and we take that responsibility seriously. For RubyGems.org to succeed, it must not only maintain near-perfect operational uptime but also earn the community’s trust that it is operated professionally, that its operators can attest to the integrity of both the data and the code it serves to millions of Ruby applications worldwide, and that the privacy of the data we hold remains intact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To that end, we commit to the following improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update our access revocation procedures and checklists to ensure access is also revoked to the Ruby Central enterprise password manager.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update our access revocation procedures to ensure any non-federated credentials (particularly shared credentials) are rotated quickly after a personnel separation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commission an independent security audit of Ruby Central’s systems and access.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finalize formal Operator and Contributor Agreements to clearly define who may hold production access and under what conditions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Did Ruby Central Treat This Event as a Security Incident?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of our recent actions, we determined that many RubyGems.org systems were controlled by a single individual; an untenable situation for a service of this importance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To provide additional context to the community about our decision to formalize production access through Operator and Contributor Agreements, and to explain why we treated this incident as a genuine security event, we are sharing context from conversations between Mr. Arko and Ruby Central personnel leading up to the September 18th access changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early August 2025, Ruby Central began reviewing its open source contractor budget, which totaled approximately $762,000 in 2024. On-call coverage is critical for a service like RubyGems.org and allows us to ensure operational continuity and rapid response to production incidents. Every on-call shift has a primary who is directly responsible for responding to incidents, and a secondary who is there to serve as a back up and an escalation point, if and when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For RubyGems.org, the secondary on-call rotation, which serves as a backup layer, was rarely activated. Ruby Central’s long-term goal was to transition this limited paid function into a distributed network of volunteer operators who could share those responsibilities without additional cost, ensuring both operational continuity and financial sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following these budget adjustments, Mr. Arko’s consultancy, which had been receiving approximately $50,000 per year for providing the secondary on-call service, submitted a proposal offering to provide secondary on-call services at no cost in exchange for access to production HTTP access logs, containing IP addresses and other personally identifiable information (PII). The offer would have given Mr. Arko’s consultancy access to that data, so that they could monetize it by analyzing access patterns and potentially sharing it with unrelated third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The board and leadership team determined that this proposal crossed important ethical and legal boundaries, introducing privacy, conflict-of-interest, and governance concerns inconsistent with Ruby Central’s responsibilities as stewards of the ecosystem. These concerns set in motion Ruby Central’s decision to adopt the new operating model and governance structure detailed in this blog post. With this context in mind, when we discovered that Mr. Arko had retained access to production systems containing PII, it prompted us to consider it as a security incident and to respond immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on our preliminary investigation, as of the publication of this post, we have no evidence to indicate that any RubyGems.org data was copied or retained by unauthorized parties, including Mr. Arko.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recognize that these events have raised valid questions within the community and tested confidence in how Ruby Central fulfills its stewardship role. Our intent in sharing this level of detail is to be transparent about what occurred, what we have learned, and what we are doing to prevent it from happening again. We are hopeful that this openness marks a meaningful step toward rebuilding trust in our stewardship and demonstrating that accountability and collaboration remain central to how we serve the Ruby ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are deeply grateful to the community for holding us accountable and for the patience and professionalism shown during this process. Ruby Central remains committed to transparent, responsible stewardship of the RubyGems infrastructure and to maintaining the security and trust that the Ruby ecosystem depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shan Cureton&lt;lb/&gt;Executive Director&lt;/p&gt;
