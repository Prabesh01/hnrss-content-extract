    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;HipKittens: Fast and Furious AMD Kernels&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AI is gated by hardware. We think that opening up AI’s compute landscape is one of the most important problems to be working on right now. Building towards this goal, we present HipKittens: SoTA AMD kernels and a collection of opinionated programming primitives to make AMD kernel dev easier!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Named after AMD's CUDA equivalent, called HIP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Building towards multi-silicon AI systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While AI has largely used a single hardware vendor to get to its current stage, AMD GPU hardware now offers state-of-the-art peak compute and memory bandwidth. However, this performance is locked away from AI workflows due to the lack of mature AMD software.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;8.0 TB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Table 1: Hardware overview. Peak memory and compute speeds for the latest generation GPU platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AMD software ecosystem includes AITER, a high performance AI kernel library; PyTorch and a few compilers (Triton, Mojo, TileLang); and Composable Kernel (CK), AMD's C++ based programming model for writing kernels. However, despite gigawatt-scale AMD deployments, the software remains brittle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The existing software offerings fail to consistently achieve peak performance. CK kernels frequently underperform (see our evaluations below). AITER and PyTorch are volatile; for instance, AITER and PyTorch SDPA Llama GQA backwards kernels achieve just 30% and 24% of SoTA performance respectively on AMD MI355X GPUs. And the compilers currently significantly sacrifice performance and have not yet demonstrated reusable programming primitives for AMD. Further, we find that some critical aspects of hardware functionality around bank conflict avoidance are undocumented in the CDNA ISA, discussed in our technical deep dive blog.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Details: expand to learn more about our current compiler observations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expand on a few observations about current compilers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mojo's MHA forwards kernel suffers from bank conflicts and offers just 50% of peak performance on the MI355X (e.g., 430 TFLOPs at B=16, H=16, N=2048, D=128).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TileLang is currently limited to CDNA3 and the MHA kernel “is competitive with PyTorch”, which is amongst the slowest baselines (see results below). TileLang lacks many features that we believe are important for AMD kernels--multiple matrix core shapes like 32x32x16, buffer_load_dwordx4, XCD chiplet swizzling--and also has dependencies on Composable Kernel, adding complexity to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On AMD, Triton struggles with register lifetime tracking and lowering memory accesses to the most performant intrinsics. For example, it may fail to reclaim registers or lower vectorized loads. In our evaluations, we find that Triton kernels from AMD’s ROCm/Triton tend to underperform (even on a vanilla BF16 GEMM).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the Pythonic interface and portability of such compilers is helpful, our goal is to identify the principles that lead to peak performance as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a result, AMD's most performant AI kernels need to be hand-optimized by experts in raw assembly. It is very difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads and as a result, most widely used AI workloads are unsupported/under-optimized on AMD (e.g., we see this on some attention problem shapes, non-causal gqa backwards pass, memory bound kernels).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all of this, it remains up in the air what the best path forwards is for multi-silicon kernel development!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the AI community says that there’s a CUDA moat in AI software: tweet #1, tweet #2, tweet #3 and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that being said, developing performant NVIDIA kernels was also painstakingly tedious a few years ago. Using low level CUDA/CUTLASS, it took two years between the H100 GPU’s release and the release of peak performance open-source attention kernels. Compilers and LLMs-for-kernel-development on NVIDIA have so far sacrificed performance for simplicity and struggled to quickly support new hardware features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opinionated primitives are simplifying the process of writing performant NVIDIA kernels! Amazingly through the community’s effort on all these DSLs and AI assistants, NVIDIA kernel development is starting to get easier! Last year, we shared our opinionated take on kernel DSLs — keep the familiar PyTorch feel, but make the primitives C++ embedded to get peak performance, simplicity and extensibility to hardware platforms and AI workloads. In May 2024, we shared ThunderKittens (TK), and have been excited to see its ideas used in a wave of frameworks this year like CuTe DSL in Sept 2025, Tiny Grad “tinykittens”, TileLang in April 2025 and Gluon in June 2025. It’s been fun to see TK used in companies like Together AI, Jump Trading, and Cursor and in academic research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So then we were curious whether entirely new programming primitives are needed to simplify AMD kernel development, or whether existing primitives suffice. It wasn't obvious to us where this exploration would end up; most modern kernels are designed around NVIDIA-specific hardware features. AMD hardware differs meaningfully (no wgmma/tcgen05 pipelined async matmuls, no tma, no mbarriers, no register reallocation, smaller shared memory, chiplet instead of monolithic, etc.) and we weren't sure where performance would end up nor how different the primitives might look compared to NVIDIA frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our exploration resulted in HipKittens, a minimal, opinionated collection of C++ embedded programming primitives for fast AMD kernels. We find:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The tile abstraction generalizes across architectures. The core tile-based primitives we identified as effective on NVIDIA GPUs—including tile types, PyTorch-like bulk compute operators over tiles, and composable load/store interfaces—translate naturally to AMD.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backend implementations are architecture-specific. The underlying memory access patterns (e.g., swizzling schemes, register scheduling) that realize the tile interface differ between AMD and NVIDIA due to hardware differences.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scheduling strategies adapt to hardware constraints. The scheduling patterns both within a processor and across processors differ on AMD compared to NVIDIA, reflecting fundamental architectural distinctions. Wave specialization underperforms on CDNA3 and CDNA4. However, reasoning about schedules at the tile granularity—rather than at the level of individual registers or memory transactions—continues to simplify development, maintain code readability, and enable peak performance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we see that tile-based abstractions remain general across architectures, providing evidence that a unified, performant programming model for AI accelerators is achievable. The key insight is separating the interface (tiles and operations on tiles) from the implementation (how tiles map to hardware), allowing the same high-level programming model to target diverse GPU architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Climbing out of the CUDA moat: Introducing HipKittens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first explored ThunderKittens for NVIDIA, then ThunderMittens on Apple Silicon and now we’re excited to share HipKittens (HK) for AMD!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HK kernels are performant, while remaining easy to read and modify! We might not need raw assembly for peak performance AMD kernels any more! Life is good!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's go through the results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our attention forwards kernels are written in ~500 lines of code and outperform all of AMDs baselines on average, including the AITER kernels which are written in hand-optimized assembly! We show different head dimensions () and sequence lengths , for both causal and non-causal settings.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our GEMM kernel features a hot loop that's lines of code and achieves peak performance. Again, AITER and HipBLASLT kernels are programmed in ... raw assembly!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We also get speedy attention backwards pass, rotary, and fused dropout-residual-layernorm kernels compared to the strongest available baselines! These results use head dimension and we vary the sequence length.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Multi-silicon AI is coming!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realizing AI's full potential requires diverse, open hardware.1 Today, that means making AMD GPUs truly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want more AI in the world. AI has relied on and innovated on a single hardware provider, but we need to be able to use and experiment with all the kinds of compute we can. We need to be able to use the fastest hardware out there. We’re happy to help address these problems with HipKittens!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checkout part two for a technical deep dive on HK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alongside offering peak hardware capabilities, AMD's software stack is also open-source!↩&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember when you thought age verification laws couldn't get any worse? Well, lawmakers in Wisconsin, Michigan, and beyond are about to blow you away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's unfortunately no longer enough to force websites to check your government-issued ID before you can access certain content, because politicians have now discovered that people are using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy and bypass these invasive laws. Their solution? Entirely ban the use of VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, really.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of “protecting children” in A.B. 105/S.B. 130. It’s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed “sexual content” to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are “harmful to minors” beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing—potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This follows a notable pattern: As we’ve explained previously, lawmakers, prosecutors, and activists in conservative states have worked for years to aggressively expand the definition of “harmful to minors” to censor a broad swath of content: diverse educational materials, sex education resources, art, and even award-winning literature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin’s bill has already passed the State Assembly and is now moving through the Senate. If it becomes law, Wisconsin could become the first state where using a VPN to access certain content is banned. Michigan lawmakers have proposed similar legislation that did not move through its legislature, but among other things, would force internet providers to actively monitor and block VPN connections. And in the UK, officials are calling VPNs "a loophole that needs closing."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is actually happening. And it's going to be a disaster for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Here's Why This Is A Terrible Idea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VPNs mask your real location by routing your internet traffic through a server somewhere else. When you visit a website through a VPN, that website only sees the VPN server's IP address, not your actual location. It's like sending a letter through a P.O. box so the recipient doesn't know where you really live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when Wisconsin demands that websites "block VPN users from Wisconsin," they're asking for something that's technically impossible. Websites have no way to tell if a VPN connection is coming from Milwaukee, Michigan, or Mumbai. The technology just doesn't work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Websites subject to this proposed law are left with this choice: either cease operation in Wisconsin, or block all VPN users, everywhere, just to avoid legal liability in the state. One state's terrible law is attempting to break VPN access for the entire internet, and the unintended consequences of this provision could far outweigh any theoretical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Almost Everyone Uses VPNs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's talk about who lawmakers are hurting with these bills, because it sure isn't just people trying to watch porn without handing over their driver's license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Businesses run on VPNs. Every company with remote employees uses VPNs. Every business traveler connecting through sketchy hotel Wi-Fi needs one. Companies use VPNs to protect client and employee data, secure internal communications, and prevent cyberattacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Students need VPNs for school. Universities require students to use VPNs to access research databases, course materials, and library resources. These aren't optional, and many professors literally assign work that can only be accessed through the school VPN. The University of Wisconsin-Madison’s WiscVPN, for example, “allows UW–Madison faculty, staff and students to access University resources even when they are using a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP).”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vulnerable people rely on VPNs for safety. Domestic abuse survivors use VPNs to hide their location from their abusers. Journalists use them to protect their sources. Activists use them to organize without government surveillance. LGBTQ+ people in hostile environments—both in the US and around the world—use them to access health resources, support groups, and community. For people living under censorship regimes, VPNs are often their only connection to vital resources and information their governments have banned.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regular people just want privacy. Maybe you don't want every website you visit tracking your location and selling that data to advertisers. Maybe you don't want your internet service provider (ISP) building a complete profile of your browsing history. Maybe you just think it's creepy that corporations know everywhere you go online. VPNs can protect everyday users from everyday tracking and surveillance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It’s A Privacy Nightmare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what happens if VPNs get blocked: everyone has to verify their age by submitting government IDs, biometric data, or credit card information directly to websites—without any encryption or privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already know how this story ends. Companies get hacked. Data gets breached. And suddenly your real name is attached to the websites you visited, stored in some poorly-secured database waiting for the inevitable leak. This has already happened, and is not a matter of if but when. And when it does, the repercussions will be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forcing people to give up their privacy to access legal content is the exact opposite of good policy. It's surveillance dressed up as safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"Harmful to Minors" Is Not a Catch-All&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's another fun feature of these laws: they're trying to broaden the definition of “harmful to minors” to sweep in a host of speech that is protected for both young people and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, states can prohibit people under 18 years old from accessing sexual materials that an adult can access under the First Amendment. But the definition of what constitutes “harmful to minors” is narrow — it generally requires that the materials have almost no social value to minors and that they, taken as a whole, appeal to a minors’ “prurient sexual interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin's bill defines “harmful to minors” much more broadly. It applies to materials that merely describe sex or feature descriptions/depictions of human anatomy. This definition would likely encompass a wide range of literature, music, television, and films that are protected under the First Amendment for both adults and young people, not to mention basic scientific and medical content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the bill’s definition would apply to any websites where more than one third of the site’s material is "harmful to minors." Given the breadth of the definition and its one-third trigger, we anticipate that Wisconsin could argue that the law applies to most social media websites. And it’s not hard to imagine, as these topics become politicised, Wisconsin claiming it applies to websites containing LGBTQ+ health resources, basic sexual education resources, and reproductive healthcare information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This breadth of the bill’s definition isn't a bug, it's a feature. It gives the state a vast amount of discretion to decide which speech is “harmful” to young people, and the power to decide what's "appropriate" and what isn't. History shows us those decisions most often harm marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It Won’t Even Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's say Wisconsin somehow manages to pass this law. Here's what will actually happen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People who want to bypass it will use non-commercial VPNs, open proxies, or cheap virtual private servers that the law doesn't cover. They'll find workarounds within hours. The internet always routes around censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in a fantasy world where every website successfully blocked all commercial VPNs, people would just make their own. You can route traffic through cloud services like AWS or DigitalOcean, tunnel through someone else's home internet connection, use open proxies, or spin up a cheap server for less than a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, everyone else (businesses, students, journalists, abuse survivors, regular people who just want privacy) will have their VPN access impacted. The law will accomplish nothing except making the internet less safe and less private for users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, as we’ve mentioned previously, while VPNs may be able to disguise the source of your internet activity, they are not foolproof—nor should they be necessary to access legally protected speech. Like the larger age verification legislation they are a part of, VPN-blocking provisions simply don't work. They harm millions of people and they set a terrifying precedent for government control of the internet. More fundamentally, legislators need to recognize that age verification laws themselves are the problem. They don't work, they violate privacy, they're trivially easy to circumvent, and they create far more harm than they prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A False Dilemma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have (predictably) turned to VPNs to protect their privacy as they watched age verification mandates proliferate around the world. Instead of taking this as a sign that maybe mass surveillance isn't popular, lawmakers have decided the real problem is that these privacy tools exist at all and are trying to ban the tools that let people maintain their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's be clear: lawmakers need to abandon this entire approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer to "how do we keep kids safe online" isn't "destroy everyone's privacy." It's not "force people to hand over their IDs to access legal content." And it's certainly not "ban access to the tools that protect journalists, activists, and abuse survivors.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If lawmakers genuinely care about young people's well-being, they should invest in education, support parents with better tools, and address the actual root causes of harm online. What they shouldn't do is wage war on privacy itself. Attacks on VPNs are attacks on digital privacy and digital freedom. And this battle is being fought by people who clearly have no idea how any of this technology actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you live in Wisconsin—reach out to your Senator and urge them to kill A.B. 105/S.B. 130. Our privacy matters. VPNs matter. And politicians who can't tell the difference between a security tool and a "loophole" shouldn't be writing laws about the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh, a refreshing bit of optimism in these dark times!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things in all of professional sports is the unofficial holiday referred to as “Bobby Bonilla Day.” The short version of it is that Bonilla played for the New York Mets decades ago and eventually bought out his contract in 2000 when they decided they were done with him. Rather than pay the $5.9 million buyout of the contract up front, the team instead made the bonkers decision to negotiate a deferred payment schedule for that amount with 8% interest over the course of 25 years. The result is that the Mets will be paying Bonilla $1.2 million per year every July 1st, starting in 2011 and ending in 2035. And if you can’t make sense of the math on that one, it’s because you aren’t aware that the Mets ownership was one of Bernie Madoff’s many victims, which is why they had to defer the payments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 10th is not Bobby Bonilla Day. But it should be named “Let Us Play No One Lives Forever, You Assholes Day.” The classic spy-shooter turned 25 on that date and, for the exact same reasons we’ve detailed for a god damned decade now, you still can’t buy the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the short of it. Due to a series of mergers, closures, and rights purchases, the IP rights for No One Lives Forever and its sequel have been potentially split into three pieces between Warner Bros., Activision, and 20th Century Fox, like it was some kind of fucking horcrux. I say potentially because nobody really knows who owns what, if anything, when it comes to these games. When one company, Nightdive Studios, attempted to remaster and re-release the game as they’ve done with other titles, along with securing trademark rights to the game which hasn’t been sold in over a decade, all three companies complained that they may have rights to it and may sue over it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of those qualifiers are, again, because even these companies themselves don’t know what rights they actually have. And why is that? Well, because the gaming rights deals were inked before digital storage was widely used for this sort of thing and, well, nobody seems to be able to locate the actual paperwork denoting who owns what. Here’s an example of an exchange Nightdive had with Activision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“So we went back to Activision and, [after] numerous correspondence going back and forth, they replied that they thought they might have some rights, but that any records predated digital storage. So we’re talking about a contract in a box someplace.” Kuperman laughed. “The image I get is the end of Indiana Jones… somewhere in a box, maybe in the bowels of Activision, maybe it was shipped off to Iron Mountain or somewhere. And they confessed, they didn’t have [their] hands on it. And they weren’t sure that they even had any of those rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which didn’t keep Activision from warning Nightdive that it might totally sue if it moved forward with remastering the game. The other companies made similar noises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s a person to do if they want to play this game? You can’t buy it legitimately currently. It’s not even for sale anywhere. And a situation like that, which I’ve stated before, completely breaks the copyright bargain. The only option is, as Kotaku of all places notes, to download it for free from somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Downloading games that are available for sale is piracy. It’s illegal, and it’s not supportive of developers and their art. But when companies have gone out of their way to refuse to take your money for a game for the better part of two decades, it’s a very different situation. Look, I’m not your real mom and dad, and I can’t tell you what to do. But if you were to click on this link (link removed by Techdirt due to us not knowing where it takes you) and download both games (as well as spin-off Contract Jack), you’d end up with modernized versions of these classic games, with mods that allow them to work on Windows 10 and 11, and in widescreen. And what better time to do (or not do) this than on the first game’s 25th anniversary?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this point (as indeed it was over eight years ago, the last time I suggested just downloading it, to no negative response at all) we have to consider No One Lives Forever to be abandonware. No one is willing to take ownership of it, although those that could do so sometimes mindlessly threaten to intervene should anyone else try to rebuild it for sale. Nightdive were scared off a decade ago, and it’s been sitting on GOG’s Dreamlist since that launched earlier this year (with 87,171 people saying they’d pay for it if they could). It’s far too small of a concern for any of the megacorps who might own it to spend the time and money to work out if they do, but it’s far too big of a concern within gaming history to be allowed to just disappear. Thank goodness for the anonymous heroes running NOLF Revival. I thank them for their service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the only option the public has to play this game and enjoy this small piece of our collective culture. The real answer here is some sort of copyright reform that makes this situation not a thing. If a company, or group of companies, won’t offer a piece of work for sale, can’t be bothered to understand what they own of it, if anything, and have no plans to figure any of that out… then how can this be copyright infringement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So happy “Let Us Play No One Lives Forever, You Assholes” Day. Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Filed Under: copyright, ip rights, no one lives forever, video games &lt;lb/&gt; Companies: 20th century fox, activision, microsoft, nightdive, warner bros. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh, a refreshing bit of optimism in these dark times!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t really agree it’s optimistic. Why does “legitimacy” depend on us giving money to assholes? Why should we go so far as to seek them out and force them to take our money? What does it mean to “buy” digital data anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say it is legitimate to download games for free online. It’s not in any way related to “piracy”, and we shouldn’t be treating it as somehow “wrong”. There’s certainly no need to lament our inability to find some corporate overlord to give money to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best copyright reform would be abolition. But I don’t see why we should wait for legislators, who are out of touch and are anyway in bed with corporate interests, to realize this. We could stop giving money to copyright maximalists right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IANAL, but I’d say just release and let them sue.&lt;lb/&gt; If they can’t find the documentation during discovery, case dismissed. Maybe even counter-sue for legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then they have an incentive to look for the paperwork. they don’t have any particular reason to go looking right now but if they see money and a lawsuit they’ll assign someone to start digging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could be in for a really big payout to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it would be a gamble, and the potential payoff is probably not worth the risk you would be taking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;IANAL, but I’d say just release and let them sue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You didn’t need to add that first part, it’s implied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn’t it funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you couldn’t prove you own your house the rich would you you and your family dead in the streets instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they can’t prove they own the ip. No one is allowed to ever touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the rich need to die like the evil pedophiles they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am baffled why we make intellectual property as legally upheld as physical property, and yet we still end up with these areas that are so untouchably gray area nobody can do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of physical property gray areas, there are certainly disputed areas, but almost nowhere on Earth do people avoid due to the ambiguity. The only real example I know is Bir Tawil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It happens all the time in physical property; the most sterotypical example would be inheritance law, but it regularly shows up in business as well (most commonly small businesses, partnerships, S corps, etc, though also in areas like bankuptcy proceedings for larger businessnesses, and certainly when things become transnational).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the main point of commonality for areas where this is common is the old cliche; possession may not literally be 9/10 of the law, but it certainly has a major impact. Whenever it is not really an option to rule on physical possession, ownership of anything routinely becomes exactly the gray area you complain of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for your example regarding physical land claims by govenments, that’s a funny joke. There are massive areas of land whose ownership is “untouchably gray” and are generally avoided. Your example is only notable in that nobody is currently dying over it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It happens all the time in physical property; the most sterotypical example would be inheritance law&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does “it” refer to, and what is inheritance law an example of? Disputes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my view, inheritance law is meant to simplify property-ownership after death. If we didn’t have it, people would come up with ways to simulate it, such as having a trust or corporation own their property. And the courts would have to waste time dealing with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, there are sometimes minor gray areas, but “untouchably gray” is quite uncommon. If some property was known to be owned by the dead person, and its new ownership is unclear, a court will resolve that. If you find some real estate you want to buy, you can get an ownership record for it; if the owner can’t be contacted, you can squat there, and the usual worst case in that you’ll eventually get evicted (and the best case is that, after maybe a decade or two, you become the legal owner). With copyright, there’s no way to tell who, if anyone, holds the rights; if it does turn out to be owned, anyone using the material could be hit with statutory damages of $150,000, and that risk persists for like 150 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;intellectual property as legally upheld as physical property&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to see something like adverse possession. Like, if it’s been openly distributed as abandonware for 10 years without complaint, it becomes public-domain. (Not that 10-year-old stuff has any business being copyrighted anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those NOLF IP “feeling unproductive, might litigate later… idk &amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3” hogging assholes can burn in… molten lava? Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the link in the article is indeed a valid, working dedicated site for hosting “pirated” copies of these games and it hasn’t been taken down in nearly a decade says a lot about how much the potential “rightsholders” genuinely do not give a damn about this series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feels like copyright law should have stipulations for cases like this, especially considering how long terms are right now – corporations shouldn’t be sitting on copyrights doing absolutely nothing with them like dragon hoards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They don’t care enough to get a judgement on some random internet site- but if there was a potential to demand a nice slice carved off of GOG then you bet they would be digging through those metaphorical or literal boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is that the song from the opening in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 with Top Chop and Leatherface?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prolly should just call their bluff. If they don’t have a contract in a box, well, sucks to be them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No-one plays…forever. Well, legally anyway.&lt;lb/&gt; The only games are being played by the corporations, and played so poorly that EVERYONE loses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tim, your comments and the comments on here about “how can this be copyright infringement” indicate that culturally, we now live in a world where both the reason for copyright and the use of copyright are strongly at odds with the LEGAL thing that is copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone creates something, copyright gives them, for a limited time, control over who can make copies, in exchange for encouragement to create works in the first place knowing that there will be a period of exclusivity on creating those copies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, the work is already created, and the owners of the rights are essentially saying “we know that we own some bits of this, and we want to enforce our exclusivity.” That’s fully within their rights, and could be (tenuously) argued to be part of what convinced the original rightsholders to create the game (and then sell the rights).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What annoys me more is when an original creator writes something, sells the copyright, and then is prevented from creating new works by the new rights holder who has no intention of creating anything new themselves, but is using the copyright instead as a tool to restrict the marketplace, pumping up the value of unrelated and already created works. This is the exact OPPOSITE of the intention behind copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The One that is and Aint in Australia, that Pops up a Store every few years, that Doent sell anything, it JUST stands there, to KEEP the Rights to the company name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having to store 1 copy of a program SOMEPLACE, forever to keep your rights.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;November 4, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granny won me over with the government cheese. As a child, maybe 4 or 5 years old, when I’d visit her on occasional Sundays in Blue Ridge, Georgia, she’d slice me off a little treat — an orange rectangle from a brown cardboard box in the refrigerator. We would sit around her kitchen table, where she held court with my aunts by telling stories and making plans for canning vegetables. Sometimes the aunts smoked cigarettes, which they’d quickly stamp out when my preacher-grandfather came around the corner. Nevermind that my snack was processed and inexpensive, a generic type of Velveeta. In those days at Granny’s, sitting with my cheese and the grown-ups in our rural mountain town, I might as well have been tasting Camembert on the banks of the Seine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevermind, too, the Mason jars of homemade soup on her shelves, a kaleidoscope of summer’s bounty — tomatoes, okra, corn — put up and waiting to take the chill off colder days. Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe. I would learn to appreciate all those later. As a kid, the cheese wowed me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother tried to explain that it was a commodity provided by government funding for the school cafeteria where my grandmother worked. “Maybe you shouldn’t mention the cheese,” Mom said recently, when I told her about writing this story. She has a good point. Folks don’t like to hear the words processed and school food in the same sentence. And Mom wouldn’t want people to think Granny was somehow taking advantage of the system. But don’t worry, Mom. The cheese is part of the point. I want people to know how Granny believed in wasting nothing, in sharing everything. In cooking from scratch as often as possible but also making do with every resource provided to her. And, yes, she sometimes had leftover cheese at home, but she also got in trouble for sneaking extra food into the paper sacks of kids without lunch money or even handing food out the back of the lunchroom screen door. “Situational ethics,” my cousin Susie calls it. I’d come to understand all that later. But as a kid, I just knew Granny’s job was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beulah Culpepper started work as an assistant lunch lady at Blue Ridge Elementary School in 1950 at age 43. That’s after she’d had eight kids of her own, whom she raised by home cooking, pickling, canning, and keeping chickens. She married young, after a rough childhood. My grandparents held a small ceremony on the railroad tracks outside the textile plant where they’d met. My grandfather called her Sunshine. And, for the outsized proportion of his noggin, she called him Fathead. She never learned to drive, and she only had a third-grade education. But when my father, her youngest, started school, she decided she was going with him. “We walked to school together every morning,” Dad told me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She worked her way to manager at the cafeteria, retiring in the early 1980s. Over the course of her tenure, her education level sometimes couldn’t keep up with her natural-born smarts, so she’d ask for my aunt’s help on the weekends to work out the financial parts of her menus. She became known for her vegetable soups, yeast rolls, and peanut butter cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mom remembers Granny’s frustration as, over time, guidelines and budgets added complicated layers to the work and hampered the scratch cooking she preferred. The government cheese went into big batches of creamy macaroni served alongside crisp, fried fish and scoops of turnip greens. She’d sneak in bacon grease from home to flavor green beans. Sadly, her own savory cornbread eventually gave way to a quicker and sweeter mix at school. My cousin Margaret remembers a student asking her: “Mrs. Culpepper, is this cornbread — or just bad cake?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;County employees would sometimes join the students for lunch as if she were running a restaurant. “She had a name county-wide for the meals she served,” says Gene Crawford, a columnist for the local newspaper who taught at the school in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sheila Robinson (age 56; 7 years in the cafeteria; from St. Louis, Missouri)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dad remembers when the lunchroom was just an old clapboard structure with wooden floors. Students who brought their lunch, often because they couldn’t afford the cafeteria meal, sat on benches along the perimeter. Granny tried to be discreet in making sure those kids had plenty. “What have you got to eat today?” Dad remembers her asking, peeking into their bags and sometimes finding nothing but a leftover biscuit. “She would give them anything she could get her hands on,” he says. She left out extra bowls of grits and gravy or commodity foods for students to share. At least once, the principal scolded her for giving away food for free. “Do I make money for this lunchroom?” she asked him. Yes. “Do I lose money for this lunchroom?” No. “Well, don’t you ever get on to me again for giving those kids food,” my mother remembers Granny recounting. “No kid will ever leave this lunchroom hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But before we go too far: a warning. If you’re looking for a dreamy, idyllic grandma story where I stand at her elbow and learn recipes, this ain’t it. I somehow don’t have a single recipe from Granny, even if she was the best cook I’ve ever known. But I did learn plenty else from her and felt her love in different ways. I’d sometimes sit with her and her dogs Tico or George while she chewed tobacco and watched Braves games. I remember her feisty attitude, stout build, and strong hands. She would squeeze my upper arms every time I entered her kitchen and compliment me on weight gain (a confusing but comforting message for a teen girl). It took me years to realize how she’d influenced my life as a food writer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reflecting on her now, I wanted to check in with modern-day heroes of the school lunch line. Even as it feels like our social safety nets are crumbling, I see in these workers a sharp stewardship of resources, a special sort of hospitality, and — despite government red tape and political divides — a deep commitment to community care.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephanie Dillard at Enterprise City Schools in South Alabama likes to sit down for lunch with the kids and hear their thoughts on the food. She’s a longtime board member and newly elected president of the School Nutrition Association, a nonprofit organization of more than 50,000 lunch ladies (and fellas) and others interested in school nutrition. But day to day, you’ll find Dillard filling in for kitchen staff, crunching budget numbers, and working to get fresh, locally grown foods onto kids’ plates. Last year that meant satsumas from a neighboring county to serve with roasted chicken and broccoli. It meant local strawberries and even a special shrimp bowl with the region’s beloved Conecuh sausage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The greatest joy is just knowing that we are feeding children healthy meals. So many families rely on us daily,” Dillard says. “I just want to continue to see that all children have equal access to the meals.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dillard is clear about the challenges. “Number one, we need more funding, so we can increase scratch cooking and more farm-to-school programs,” she says. “With the MAHA movement, they’re pushing, obviously, more scratch cooking, and that’s great and grand. I have no problem with less processed foods in schools, but we need the funding to be able to support it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be sure, the stew of school food has long been mixed with politics and money. The National School Lunch Act, which passed in 1946, four years before my grandmother started cafeteria work, had its roots in an ecosystem of competing interests, says Marcus Weaver-Hightower, author of Unpacking School Lunch: Understanding the Hidden Politics of School Food. Over the years, politicians have argued over funding cuts, regulations, and what makes food healthy — along with who gets to set the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of late, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to champion some of the healthier standards that conservatives once criticized, and partly rolled back, when the same ideas were espoused by then-First Lady Michelle Obama’s Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act campaign. (The opening lines of a 2014 Heritage Foundation article: “Michelle Obama thinks she knows what your children should eat.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has advocated for healthier school food even as the Trump administration has cut millions in funding that would help make that possible, including eliminating the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program and Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Caryn Needham “I love seeing the children every day.” (age 44; 4 years in the cafeteria; came to Trenton from California)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Samantha Goyret and Caroline Ideus, co-directors of the Northwest Tennessee Local Food Network, had a statewide farm-to-school plan ready to implement — at least until the funding was cut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goyret and Ideus, who produce a guide to local farmers and producers and manage a West Tennessee farmers market, began serving as vital liaisons between farmers and school nutrition directors several years ago. They knew both groups were overworked, with little time to make connections. Goyret and Ideus also helped arrange transportation and delivery. Local farmers earned market values for their products while schools amped up nutrition in ways that appealed to kids. “It’s like, OK, we’re finally finding solutions to these problems,” Goyret says. “Then the government’s like, No, we’re not going to fund you anymore. So, good luck. Just try to figure it out on your own.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisa Seiber-Garland, school nutrition director for the Trenton Special School District in Trenton, Tennessee, says students loved items like local butter lettuce and purple hull peas obtained through a federal grant. She learned that at least one student convinced her mother to visit a nearby farm for the tender leaves she had tasted atop her school burger. “It was so cool,” Seiber-Garland says. “Grants like that provide access for kids to have things they wouldn’t normally have. With that grant, we were also able to provide fresh ground beef. … We’re still doing it, but not to the extent with the grant. It was such a blessing I didn’t want to stop. I told my farmers I will do what I can to still buy. One had planted his strawberries and his watermelons and everything to meet what we needed in the school for that year. And then we lost the grant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goyret confirms that, indeed, seeds had been planted, orders had been placed. “With every administration, there’s always changes,” she says. “But what’s different about this administration is that they are taking away already allocated funds — funds allocated by the Congress. That should be 100 percent illegal.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, per usual, school nutrition directors are making do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lisa Seiber-Garland “They’re gonna be fed. We'll find a way.” (age 60; 20-plus years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Pat Morgan (age 67; 5 years in the cafeteria, from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dillard says the federal funding cuts will hurt local farmers in Alabama, but her state offers rebates when she serves Alabama-grown foods. “They direct us and help me find the farmers that have the ability to grow enough for our district,” she says. “So I’m very lucky in that aspect. As soon as we find something new or new farmers willing to grow for us, we jump on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, in Tennessee, Seiber-Garland works through a different grant specifically for elementary students to provide snacks of fresh fruit and vegetables paired with nutritional education. “The kids are the joy for sure. Watching them and their excitement when there’s something they really like,” she says, of offering students new tastes as well as standbys like peaches, grapes, berries, pepper strips, and carrots. A student’s mother came up to her at the cafeteria and said, “You’re the reason my daughter likes raspberries.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, California became the first of a half dozen or so states to offer free school meals to all students, regardless of family income. Dillard supports free meals for all students with an emphatic, “Yes, yes, yes!” Food should not be based on income, she says: “It should be part of the school day. Your transportation is of no charge to students. School books are no charge to students. School lunch should be of no charge to students. … It’s just the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, most schools must provide a mix of fee-based and subsidized free and reduced-price meals. Some communities with high percentages of families on SNAP and enrolled in Medicaid automatically qualify for the USDA’s Community Eligibility Provision, which authorizes free meals for all students in the district. But, as the “Big Beautiful Bill” slashes both SNAP and Medicaid, it will surely reverberate through school lunchrooms too. “It’s going to be a huge burden for a lot of families,” says Weaver-Hightower. “The number of problems I think [free lunches] would solve is a really long list. There’s paperwork, of course. And there’s the shame and stigma that some kids feel. Why would we do that to little 5-year-olds?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Janet Roach “The kids — that’s what I love about the job.” (age 63; 9 years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through all of the policy changes, the cafeteria has remained the “heart of our schools,” according to acclaimed chef Alice Waters. In 1995 she founded the Edible Schoolyard Project, an international nonprofit dedicated to promoting organic school gardens, kitchens, and cafeterias. Waters’ new book, A School Food Revolution (October 2025) celebrates this beating heart of public education.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan Giusti, formerly head chef at world-renowned Noma, is another prominent advocate for school lunches. He left his prestigious role in 2015 to create Brigaid, a company now working with 40 school districts in eight states along with other institutions such as senior centers and prisons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His team has adopted the pragmatic approach long espoused by the professionals in those settings. “We don’t say, This is the food you should serve, or, You shouldn’t serve this food,” he explains. “It is their program and it is their community. Who are we to come from the outside to tell them otherwise? So we come in and ask, What are you trying to achieve with your program?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giusti loves the puzzle — the dynamics and balance of nutrition and taste preference. “I was talking with a food service director, and she uses the statistic that roughly 70 percent of the calories students eat in her district come from the food in the schools. So you have a real responsibility to make sure that food is nutritious. But at the same point you also need to make sure kids want to eat it. … Kids need to eat. Period.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giusti stresses that policies need to be backed up with resources. “It’s amazing to talk about removing processed foods, cooking more from scratch. I have a business based off of that,” he says. “It’s also really hard to do. If we’re going to say to School District XYZ, You can’t use these things anymore, then I hope we’re also going to give them money to buy more equipment and train their staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, edicts need to take into account the people who have to implement them, Giusti stresses. “Folks who work in the kitchens get caught in the mix,” he says. “You can feel it on them. They’re just waiting for the next initiative. They’ve maybe been working in these schools for 20, 30 years, and they’ve seen so many initiatives come and go, come and go. They’ve seen people come and go. Superintendents come and go. But they’re still there. Doing this work every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cherie Kelly (age 48; 9 years in the cafeteria; from Ottawa, Illinois)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to my grandmother, Hope North in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, started work at the cafeteria when her son entered school. She’s been in food service ever since, about 27 years. Long enough to see her grandson attend Murfreesboro City Schools, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a recent summer day, she climbed onto a brightly painted old school bus with the words CHOW BUS across its front. Inside, the seats had been reconfigured into booths with tables. About 50 meals sat in cooler bags: penne pasta with tomato-meat sauce, a side of carrots, fruit cups, and milk. The bus was headed for Chariot Pointe Apartments, the first stop of about five that day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We meet people where they are,” says Tori Carr, a school employee who was driving a van that followed the bus, which had been converted into a sort of free book store. Its shelves also carry cleaning supplies, pantry items, and simple toys like glow sticks and coloring pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North’s cousin Keith Sneed drives the Chow Bus as well as regular bus routes during the school year. The two make a good team — tough and tender. They run their route every day in the summer heat, bus windows down. North keeps tabs on her people at each stop. She knows their stories and worries. And if they don’t show up for a few days, she’ll be on the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’d hardly parked at their first location, when a young man in a yellow T-shirt approached the bus. Sneed poked his head out the window. “Man, go get a book!” he said. “You ain’t read a book all summer.” The boy couldn’t help but oblige. Book in hand, he got a fist bump from Sneed as he climbed up the steps for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not just about the food,” Sneed explained later. “All they want is for you to listen to them.” But, of course, food is important, too. Not all schools can serve summer meals, which leaves many students at risk. And while this school used to have three Chow buses, funded by a USDA grant, they’re now down to one. “If we lose this bus,” Sneed says, “people will be hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cathy Hill (age 62; 2 years in the cafeteria; from Humboldt, Tennessee, but moved to Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Carolyn White “The kids keep me active.” (age 64; 4 years in the cafeteria; came here from California)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, my grandmother’s town of Blue Ridge is surrounded by million-dollar vacation homes, its downtown sidewalks lined with art galleries and outfitters selling $6,000 bamboo fly rods. The economic disparity between visitors and full-time residents is vast. Fannin County schools qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision, which allows free meals for all — at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Martha Williams, who works as director of nutrition and wellness in Fannin County School District, grew up here and originally returned to teach math. But a cafeteria lunch lady inspired Williams to work in school nutrition when she pulled the teacher aside and pointed out a student who seemed disheveled and kept wearing the same clothes. Williams recognized the insights that can be gleaned from the serving line and how the work goes beyond keeping kids fed to providing stability, routine, and community care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Williams points to another inspiration, GiGi Thomas, 63, who has worked in school food service for more than two decades. These days one of her duties is serving cookies, kept in an ancient warmer that “probably came over on the Mayflower,” Thomas says with a laugh. She hands students freshly baked cookies on napkins. “I see these kids every day,” she says. Some of them like chocolate chip cookies, others prefer sugar cookies. “It tickles them to death that I kind of remember what they get.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, her cookies were featured in the high school seniors’ graduation video. “If you don’t have the cookies, those kids are devastated,” Thomas says. “That’s all you wanna do is take care of the kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over in West Tennessee, Seiber-Garland says she sometimes feels like she has 1,400 kids of her own. If no one shows up for a student on grandparents’ day, she fills in. And she loves running into students outside school, where they’re excited to say, “There’s my lunch lady!” Alumni sometimes share photos of their kids. “They’re so special. Every one of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over her 22 years in the business, Seiber-Garland has served her mother’s recipe for poppyseed chicken as well as old favorites like chicken tetrazzini and spaghetti. “I’ve always said, I want this to be their cafe. I can’t control what goes on at night. But for two-thirds or three-fourths of the day, I can. And I want them to be fed and happy, well, and blessed. They bless me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She tells of a student who kept trying to save her meal to carry home, because she didn’t have anything to eat there. Seiber-Garland and her staff found a way to provide her with a second meal for the evening. “I also had a parent come tell me to not let her child eat. And I’m like, No ma’am. If she asks to eat in my line, I’m gonna feed her.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seiber-Garland says there are people who donate every year to help pay off lunch balances that have remained unpaid. Recently, she created a “share table” on a red cart with a donated Yeti cooler that helps teach kids about reducing food waste. It’s where students can leave unopened milks or whole food that they don’t want for their classmates to enjoy. She’s also been known to cover lunches out of her own pocket, and her staff has taken up collections, too. “They’re gonna be fed,” she says. “We’ll find a way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear in those words the resourcefulness and care of my own grandmother and a guiding phrase she taught my father in standing up for what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Granny would say, “You take your part.” ◊&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Go Blog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Go’s Sweet 16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This past Monday, November 10th, we celebrated the 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We released Go 1.24 in February and Go 1.25 in August, following our now well-established and dependable release cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go’s track record for building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements. Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go’s production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Core language and library improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the new &lt;code&gt;testing/synctest&lt;/code&gt; package
significantly simplifies writing tests for concurrent, asynchronous
code. Such code is particularly common in network services,
and is traditionally very hard to test well. The &lt;code&gt;synctest&lt;/code&gt; package works by
virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both,
and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests,
often with just a couple extra lines of code. It’s also a great example of Go’s
integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the
&lt;code&gt;synctest&lt;/code&gt; package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts
of the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only boost the &lt;code&gt;testing&lt;/code&gt; package got over the past year. The new
&lt;code&gt;testing.B.Loop&lt;/code&gt; API is both easier to use
than the original &lt;code&gt;testing.B.N&lt;/code&gt; API and addresses many of the traditional—and
often invisible!—pitfalls of writing Go benchmarks. The
&lt;code&gt;testing&lt;/code&gt; package also has new APIs that make it easy to
cleanup in tests that use
&lt;code&gt;Context&lt;/code&gt;, and that make it
easy to write to the test’s log.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go and containerization grew up together and work great with each other. Go 1.25 launched container-aware scheduling, making this pairing even stronger. Without developers having to lift a finger, this transparently adjusts the parallelism of Go workloads running in containers, preventing CPU throttling that can impact tail latency and improving Go’s out-of-the-box production-readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go 1.25’s new flight recorder builds on our already powerful execution tracer, enabling deep insights into the dynamic behavior of production systems. While the execution tracer generally collected too much information to be practical in long-running production services, the flight recorder is like a little time machine, allowing a service to snapshot recent events in great detail after something has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secure software development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go continues to strengthen its commitment to secure software development, making significant strides in its native cryptography packages and evolving its standard library for enhanced safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go ships with a full suite of native cryptography packages in the standard library, which reached two major milestones over the past year. A security audit conducted by independent security firm Trail of Bits yielded excellent results, with only a single low-severity finding. Furthermore, through a collaborative effort between the Go Security Team and Geomys, these packages achieved CAVP certification, paving the way for full FIPS 140-3 certification. This is a vital development for Go users in certain regulated environments. FIPS 140 compliance, previously a source of friction due to the need for unsupported solutions, will now be seamlessly integrated, addressing concerns related to safety, developer experience, functionality, release velocity, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Go standard library has continued to evolve to be safe by default and safe by design. For example, the &lt;code&gt;os.Root&lt;/code&gt;
API—added in Go 1.24—enables traversal-resistant file system
access, effectively combating a class of vulnerabilities where an
attacker could manipulate programs into accessing files intended to be
inaccessible. Such vulnerabilities are notoriously challenging to address
without underlying platform and operating system support, and the new
&lt;code&gt;os.Root&lt;/code&gt; API offers a straightforward,
consistent, and portable solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Under-the-hood improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to user-visible changes, Go has made significant improvements under the hood over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Go 1.24, we completely redesigned the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;
implementation, building on the latest and greatest ideas in
hash table design. This change is completely transparent, and brings significant
improvements to &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; performance, lower tail latency of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; operations, and
in some cases even significant memory wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go 1.25 includes an experimental and significant advancement in Go’s garbage collector called Green Tea. Green Tea reduces garbage collection overhead in many applications by at least 10% and sometimes as much as 40%. It uses a novel algorithm designed for the capabilities and constraints of today’s hardware and opens up a new design space that we’re eagerly exploring. For example, in the forthcoming Go 1.26 release, Green Tea will achieve an additional 10% reduction in garbage collector overhead on hardware that supports AVX-512 vector instructions—something that would have been nigh impossible to take advantage of in the old algorithm. Green Tea will be enabled by default in Go 1.26; users need only upgrade their Go version to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Furthering the software development stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go is about far more than the language and standard library. It’s a software development platform, and over the past year, we’ve also made four regular releases of the gopls language server, and have formed partnerships to support emerging new frameworks for agentic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gopls provides Go support to VS Code and other LSP-powered editors and IDEs. Every release sees a litany of features and improvements to the experience of reading and writing Go code (see the v0.17.0, v0.18.0, v0.19.0, and v0.20.0 release notes for full details, or our new gopls feature documentation!). Some highlights include many new and enhanced analyzers to help developers write more idiomatic and robust Go code; refactoring support for variable extraction, variable inlining, and JSON struct tags; and an experimental built-in server for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that exposes a subset of gopls’ functionality to AI assistants in the form of MCP tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With gopls v0.18.0, we began exploring automatic code modernizers. As Go evolves, every release brings new capabilities and new idioms; new and better ways to do things that Go programmers have been finding other ways to do. Go stands by its compatibility promise—the old way will continue to work in perpetuity—but nevertheless this creates a bifurcation between old idioms and new idioms. Modernizers are static analysis tools that recognize old idioms and suggest faster, more readable, more secure, more modern replacements, and do so with push-button reliability. What &lt;code&gt;gofmt&lt;/code&gt; did for
stylistic consistency, we hope modernizers can do for idiomatic
consistency. We’ve integrated modernizers as IDE suggestions, where they can
help developers not only maintain more consistent coding standards, but where we
believe they will help developers discover new features and keep up with the
state of the art. We believe modernizers can also help AI coding assistants keep
up with the state of the art and combat their proclivity to reinforce outdated
knowledge of the Go language, APIs, and idioms. The upcoming Go 1.26 release
will include a total overhaul of the long-dormant &lt;code&gt;go fix&lt;/code&gt; command to make it
apply the full suite of modernizers in bulk, a return to its pre-Go 1.0
roots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of September, in collaboration with Anthropic and the Go community, we released v1.0.0 of the official Go SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This SDK supports both MCP clients and MCP servers, and underpins the new MCP functionality in gopls. Contributing this work in open source helps empower other areas of the growing open source agentic ecosystem built around Go, such as the recently released Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Go from Google. ADK Go builds on the Go MCP SDK to provide an idiomatic framework for building modular multi-agent applications and systems. The Go MCP SDK and ADK Go demonstrate how Go’s unique strengths in concurrency, performance, and reliability differentiate Go for production AI development and we are expecting more AI workloads to be written in Go in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go has an exciting year ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re working on advancing developer productivity through the brand new &lt;code&gt;go fix&lt;/code&gt;
command, deeper support for AI coding assistants, and ongoing improvements to
gopls and VS Code Go. General availability of the Green Tea garbage collector,
native support for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) hardware features,
and runtime and standard library support for writing code that scales even
better to massive multicore hardware will continue to align Go with modern
hardware and improve production efficiency. We’re focusing on Go’s “production
stack” libraries and diagnostics, including a massive (and long in the making)
upgrade to &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;, driven by Joe Tsai and people across
the Go community; leaked goroutine
profiling, contributed by
Uber’s Programming Systems team; and many
other improvements to &lt;code&gt;net/http&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unicode&lt;/code&gt;, and other foundational packages.
We’re working to provide well-lit paths for building with Go and AI, evolving
the language platform with care for the evolving needs of today’s developers,
and building tools and capabilities that help both human developers and AI
assistants and systems alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release, we’re also looking to the future of the Go open source project itself. From its humble beginnings, Go has formed a thriving contributor community. To continue to best meet the needs of our ever-expanding user base, especially in a time of upheaval in the software industry, we’re working on ways to better scale Go’s development processes—without losing sight of Go’s fundamental principles—and more deeply involve our wonderful contributor community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go would not be where it is today without our incredible user and contributor communities. We wish you all the best in the coming year!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course you want to design (and implement!) your own programming language! It’s fun. It’s creative. It’s empowering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we do it? In a nutshell, the process is iterative, cycling between four phases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing the phases over and over is important; for example, while writing the compiler, you may be like “woah this is impossible” and then realize “oh shoot this part of the language wasn’t designed right!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps to be experienced. If you’re not, that’s okay, actually—you might get lucky!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t mistake creativity for luck that shows up without pre-existing knowledge. The most creative people are those with a lot of knowledge and experience. So you should still study and practice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your success as a language designer will be massively aided by knowledge in three main areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Wikipedia’s list of programming paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a glossary of such terms that may be helpful to review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also check out this mini-encyclopedia of 70 languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some excellent cross-language comparisons that help you to hone your understanding of how different syntaxes can express the same ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are really good too:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, many people have designed languages before you. They made mistakes. They came up with brilliant ideas. Many were wildly successful. Some never made it big. Some people have brought in years of research on how people think and learn to come up with principles for language (and environment) design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should learn form their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study classic papers. Read web essays. Visit online courses. Here is a small sampling of things to study and places to look for more information:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about the future:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And understand that traditional, mainstream programming languages, are not at all the epitome of computational expression. Languages can be much more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to strike out on your own? Here are some things to think about, in the form of a, you guessed it, a checklist:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come up with a list of capabilities, or features. Make sure they enable programmers to express their creations by following the suggestions and principles in the Learnable Programming essay, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of questions might you have here? Here are some totally random ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt;, or are there conventions, like in Go, where capitalized entities are implicitly exportable and lower-cased entities are private?
  &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;-expression for super-local scopes?
  &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; expression?
  &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;? Anything like Ruby’s &lt;code&gt;retry&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;redo&lt;/code&gt;?
  &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;?
  &lt;quote&gt;What did I just read?&lt;p&gt;Feeling like only about 20% of the questions above made any sense? Feeling like that vocabulary came out of nowhere? That’s fine for now. Learning about programming languages can be a never-ending lifelong journey, but you can use the questions you don’t quite understand now as a place to start some research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, I have a glossary you might find helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have a good idea of your language features, you’ll want to figure out a good way to organize them, structurally. This is known as your language’s abstract syntax. In an abstract syntax we don’t worry much about punctuation and parentheses and such microscopic details. We are interested in the overall structure. Here’s a look at abstract syntax trees in JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When defining your language, you will want to specify exactly what the AST Nodes are, how they are related to each other, and what their properties are. For JavaScript, the AST Node types come from a specification called EsTree.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve built an interactive application for you to explore AST generation. Please try it out!.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Too much detail?&lt;p&gt;You may notice that the EsTree specification has a lot more detail than the hand-drawn ASTs in the video above. This is okay. The specification is used to build actual compilers and interpreters, while for hand-drawn ASTs we just like to give the big picture and can take some “shortcuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to think about what your language will really look like! Remember that design is creative and iterative, so you will want to begin, like all artists do, with sketches:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do a lot of experimentation here! You will probably want to put creative effort into designing languages people like to use! What kind of syntax issues do they deal with? Dozens, actually, and we can’t cover them all. But how about a taste of just a few. We’ll peek at just a few issues that sometimes generate strong opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need to adopt a scheme for showing structure. The popular approaches are: Curly-brace (JavaScript, Java, C++, C#), Terminal-end (Ruby, Ada), Nested parentheses (Lisp, Clojure, Racket), Indentation (Python), Blocks (EToys, Scratch, Snap!), Pictures (Piet), Other (Haskell, Erlang, Prolog).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important idea here is that a single abstract syntax can be realized with many different concrete syntaxes. A concrete syntax specifies exactly which strings of characters make up structurally valid programs. For example, the AST:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;represents each of the following (and more!):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;while y - 5 == 3:
    print(x * (3 + y))
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;while y - 5 == 3 {
  print(x * (3 + y))
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;while y - 5 == 3 loop
  print(x * (3 + y))
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(while (= (- y 5) 3)
    (print (* x (+ 3 y))))
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;y 5 - 3 == [x 3 y + * print] while&lt;/code&gt;. Do you know of, or can you find, any languages which have that kind of syntax?
&lt;p&gt;In addition to structure, your choice of keywords, operators, punctuation (or lack thereof) are part of your design. Here’s an abstract syntax:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s try out a few things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;program:
    var x, y: integer
    while y - 5 == 3:
        var y: integer
        get(x)
        get(y)
        x = 2 * (3 + y)
    put(5)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;int x, y;
while y - 5 = 3 {
    int y;
    STDIN -&amp;gt; x;
    STDIN -&amp;gt; y;
    x &amp;lt;- 2 * (3 + y);
}
STDOUT &amp;lt;- 5;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;COMMENT THIS LOOKS LIKE OLD CODE
DECLARE INT X.
DECLARE INT Y.
WHILE DIFFERENCE OF Y AND 5 IS 3 LOOP:
    DECLARE INT Y.
    READ FROM STDIN INTO X.
    READ FROM STDIN INTO Y.
    MOVE PRODUCT OF 2 AND (SUM OF 3 AND Y) INTO X.
END LOOP.
WRITE 5 TO STDOUT.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(program
  (declare x int)
  (declare y int)
  (while (= (- y 5) 3)
    (define (y int))
    (read x y)
    (assign x (* 2 (+ 3 y)))
  )
  (write 5)
)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to separate one construct from another is a really big issue in syntax design, believe it or not. We can identify two main classes of languages: those in which newlines are significant and those in which they are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many languages, newlines are just like any other whitespace character (except for minor exceptions such as single-line comments and single-line string literals. Then, unless you have an S-Expression-based syntax as in LISP, Scheme, and Clojure, you’ll need semicolons to terminate (or separate) statements. This means you can (but shouldn’t) write code like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define ZERO 0
    unsigned  gcd(   unsigned   int  // Euclid's algorithm
      x,unsigned   y) {   while ( /* hello */  x&amp;gt;   ZERO
   ){unsigned temp=x;x=y   %x;y  = temp ;}return

   y ;}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you place your newlines matters greatly in, let’s see, Assembly languages, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Elm, Haskell, Go, Swift, and yes, many others. The rules can get pretty technical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python scripts are defined as sequences of logical lines, delimited by the token NEWLINE. A statement may not cross logical lines, except in the case of compound statements in which each constituent simple statement ends with a NEWLINE. Logical lines are made up of one or more physical lines according to line joining rules. Lines are implicitly jointed within parentheses, brackets, or braces; lines can be explicitly joined by ending with a backslash. These rules are somewhat exclusive of comments and string literals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruby looks at the end of each line and says “well if up to here it looks like we’ve completed a statement the we have.” This means you have to be careful where you break lines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;puts 5
  + 3
puts 5 +
  3
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints 5 then 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaScript requires most statements to be terminated by semicolons, but the compiler will put one in for you if it looks like you might have missed one. The rules by which this automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) is done have to be learned and they might be hard to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[God creating JavaScript]&lt;/p&gt;— Neckbeard Hacker (@NeckbeardHacker) August 24, 2016&lt;lb/&gt;GOD: It uses prototype-based inheritance.&lt;lb/&gt;Angel: Nice.&lt;lb/&gt;GOD: Also it secretly adds semicolons to ur code.&lt;lb/&gt;A: wat&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to be a serious JavaScript programmer, you need to learning the rules of ASI whether you choose to use semicolons or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people feel very strongly whether to use or not to use semicolons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most programming languages have functions. Seriously. But there are a lot of ways to work them into your design. Basic questions include: Must functions have exactly one argument, or zero or more arguments? Parens or no parens? Positional or keyword arguments? Argument labels? If no arguments, can we omit parentheses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can play around and see what you can come up with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;push(myStack, 55)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push myStack 55&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;[push myStack 55]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;(push myStack 55)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push(on: myStack, theValue: 55)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push(theValue: 55, on: myStack)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push on:myStack theValue:55&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push({ on: myStack, theValue: 55 })&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push { on: myStack, theValue: 55 }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push({ theValue: 55, on: myStack })&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might want to consider an ultra-low precedence function application, like they have in Haskell and F#:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum (filter even (map square a))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum $ filter even $ map square $ a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum &amp;lt;| filter even &amp;lt;| map square &amp;lt;| a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;a |&amp;gt; filter even |&amp;gt; map square |&amp;gt; sum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flip side of function calls is function definitions. You’re likely familiar with default parameters, and rest parameters. Python has cool mechanisms for requiring arguments to be positional or keyword, based on the definition. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;def sqrt(x, /)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;def line(*, x1, x2, y1, y2, width, style, color)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syntactic sugar refers to forms in a language that make certain things easier to express, but can be considered surface translations of more basic forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is best understood by example. There are zillions of examples out there. Here are a few. (Disclaimer: Some of these are just examples I made up and are not part of any real language.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Construct&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Desugared Form&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x += n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x = x + n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Compound assignment&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;a + b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;operator+(a, b)&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;code&gt;"+"(a, b)&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;code&gt;__add__(a, b)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Common in languages that allow overloading&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;a[i]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;*(a + i)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(C, C++ pointer arithmetic) And &lt;code&gt;i[a]&lt;/code&gt; works too!

&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;p -&amp;gt; x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;(*p).x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(C, C++) Field of struct being pointed to&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Some languages let you leave off parentheses in calls with no arguments&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;f x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;f(x)&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;code&gt;x.f()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Some languages let you leave off parentheses in calls with one argument&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x op y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;op(x, y)&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;code&gt;x.op(y)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Some languages let you leave off parentheses in calls with two arguments&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;let x=E1 in E2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;(x =&amp;gt; E2)(E1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Let-expression (in functional languages)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;(E1 ; E2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;(() =&amp;gt; E2)(E1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Expression sequencing (in eager functional languages)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;r = [s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;r = []&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;List comprehension&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x orelse y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;if x then x else y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(Standard ML) short-circuit disjunction&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x andalso y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;if x then y else x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(Standard ML) short-circuit conjunction&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;[x, y, z]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x :: y :: z :: nil&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Lists in Standard ML&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;"a${x}b"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;"a" + x + "b"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;String interpolation&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the sugared form is completely gratuitous or actually makes the code less readable, you sometimes hear the term syntactic syrup or syntactic saccharin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the definition from The New Hacker’s Dictionary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The opposite of syntactic sugar, a feature designed to make it harder to write bad code. Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop the programmer must jump through just to prove that he knows what’s going on, rather than to express a program action. Some programmers consider required type declarations to be syntactic salt. A requirement to write “&lt;code&gt;end if&lt;/code&gt;”, “&lt;code&gt;end while&lt;/code&gt;”, “&lt;code&gt;end do&lt;/code&gt;”, etc. to terminate the last block controlled by a control construct (as opposed to just “&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;”) would definitely be syntactic salt. Syntactic salt is like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers’ blood pressures in an unhealthy way.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people love verbose code, because explicit is better than implicit. But if you are language designer, be pragmatic: there is such a thing as code that is too verbose. What about trying to make the code like human language? Here’s an example in Hypertalk (taken from Wikipedia):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;on mouseDown
  answer file "Please select a text file to open."
  if it is empty then exit mouseDown
  put it into filePath
  if there is a file filePath then
    open file filePath
    read from file filePath until return
    put it into cd fld "some field"
    close file filePath
    set the textStyle of character 1 to 10 of card field "some field" to bold
  end if
end mouseDown
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s an example from a language that some students developed, and regretted:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;to get the truth value prime of whole number n:
    return no if n &amp;lt; 2
    for each d in 3 to n - 1 by 2:
        return no if d divides n
    end
    return yes
end
for each k in 1 to 100:
    write k if prime(k)
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice this kind of verbosity is worse than it sounds. Here’s what the New Hacker’s Dictionary has to say about this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;candygrammar /n./ A programming-language grammar that is mostly syntactic sugar; the term is also a play on “candygram.” COBOL, Apple’s Hypertalk language, and a lot of the so-called “4GL” database languages share this property. The usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as possible, on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled people to program. This intention comes to grief on the reality that syntax isn’t what makes programming hard; it’s the mental effort and organization required to specify an algorithm precisely that costs. Thus the invariable result is that candygrammar languages are just as difficult to program in as terser ones, and far more painful for the experienced hacker.&lt;lb/&gt;[The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live should not be overlooked. This was a "Jaws" parody. Someone lurking outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus ways to get the occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in the background. The last attempt is a half-hearted "Candygram!" When the door is opened, a shark bursts in and chomps the poor occupant. There is a moral here for those attracted to candygrammars.]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some languages pride themselves on doing a whole lot with few characters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example from Ruby (do you see what this does?):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;c = Hash.new 0
ARGF.each {|l| l.scan(/[A-Z']+/i).map {|w| c[w.downcase] += 1}}
c.keys.sort.each {|w| puts "#{w}, #{c[w]}"}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example from APL (The 99 bottles of beer program taken from Rosetta Code):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bob  ←  { (⍕⍵), ' bottle', (1=⍵)↓'s of beer'}
bobw ←  {(bob ⍵) , ' on the wall'}
beer ←  { (bobw ⍵) , ', ', (bob ⍵) , '; take one down and pass it around, ', bobw ⍵-1}
↑beer¨ ⌽(1-⎕IO)+⍳99
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s APL again, with an expression to find all the prime numbers up to R:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(~R∊R∘.×R)/R←1↓⍳R
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people love terse, concise code, because it says only what it needs and reduces the cognitive load, leaving you with less useless noisy syntax to learn. But if you are language designer, be pragmatic: there is such a thing as code that is too terse. Unless...that’s your goal....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golfing languages take terseness to the next level. A golfing language is a kind of esoteric programming language (a non-practical language created to experiment with weird ideas, be hard to program in, or be humorous) that allows programs to be written in an insanely small number of characters (or bytes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some CJam programs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Hello, world!"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;5{"Hello, world"oNo}*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;0X{_2$+}A*]N*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;l~@-@@-mh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;1{_B&amp;lt;}{_'**N+o)}w;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some Pyth programs (taken from the documentation):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Hello, world!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;FNrZhTN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;FNUhTN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;VhTN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;K1FNr1hQ=K*KN;K&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;.!Q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;WtQ=Q?%Q2h*Q3/Q2Q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;A(Z1;VhhTGA(H+GH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, real world language definitions come in three main flavors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official definition will have three parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Syntax (Structure)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Semantics (Meaning)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Statics&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Dynamics&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;What are the structural entities (e.g., declarations, expressions, statements, modules) and how do they fit together, perhaps with punctuation?&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;What are the non-structural rules that define a legal program (e.g., type checks, argument-parameter matching rules, visibility rules, etc.)?&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;What does a program do? What effects do each of the forms of a well-structured, legal program have on the run-time environment?&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are there three parts instead of two (i.e., just syntax and semantics)? Here’s why. While everyone might agree that the following is structurally malformed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#&amp;lt;include &amp;gt; stdio.h
main() int }
    printf["Hello, world!\n");]
{
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the following program looks good in terms of “structure” but it’s actually meaningless since it violates a contextual rule that says identifiers must be declared before use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;int main() {
    printf("%d\n", x);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say the latter program has static semantic errors because they can be detected by a compiler before the program is ever run. This is in contrast to a dynamic semantic error, which can only be detected at run time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let‘s see how we would formally specify the syntax for the simple language Astro. Assume we’ve gone through the first two design phases, and we’ve sketched out a program that shows all the features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// A simple program in Astro

radius = 55.2 * (-cos(2.8E-20) + 89) % 21;    // assignment statement
the_area = π * radius ** 2;                   // a built-in identifier
print hypot(2.28, 3 - radius) / the_area;     // print statement
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we put our ideas into words. A first pass: “Programs are structured as a sequence of one or more statements, each of which is an assignment or print statement, with expressions formed with numbers, variables, function calls, and the usual arithmetic operators, which can have parentheses when needed. Comments look like the slash-slash comments of C-like languages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural language isn’t super precise, so let’s try to tighten this up. Let’s get started defining programs, statements, and expressions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Program = Statement+ Statement = id "=" Exp ";" | print Exp ";" Exp = numeral | id | id "(" (Exp ("," Exp)*)? ")" | "-" Exp | Exp ("+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "%" | "**") Exp | "(" Exp ")"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An identifier is the computer science word for a name you attach to an entity (a variable, constant, function, type, parameter, or similar thing). Let’s decree that Astro identifiers begin with a letter, and can have letters, digits, and underscores (examples: &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;last_attempt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;p2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;overTheLimit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bot8675309_jEnNy&lt;/code&gt;). We will call letters, digits, and underscores identifier characters (&lt;code&gt;idchar&lt;/code&gt;s). But let’s also decree that &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; is not allowed to be an identifier (so we don’t confuse people)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means we have to carefully define the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; keyword very carefully. It’s not just the five letters p, r, i, n, and t. If it were then the program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;printy;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;would be legal! It would be the five characters spelling print followed by a legal expression, namely the identifer $y$. We want the word &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; to not bleed into any following characters that might be part of an expression. In other words, &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; must not be immediately followed by an identifier character. And, we have to explicitly exclude &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; from our category of identifiers. Both things are necessary. Let’s use the &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; symbol in our notation to exclude things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;print = "print" ~idchar idchar = letter | digit | "_" id = ~print letter idchar*&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; followed by the identifier &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;Now time for numerals. We’ll keep things in decimal only (no worries about hex or binary), and use the times-ten-to-the notation from popular programming languages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;numeral = digit+ ("." digit+)? (("E" | "e") ("+" | "-")? digit+)?&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking good. But what about things like &lt;code&gt;letter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt;? Should we define these? Nah, let’s say that in our definition schema that these things are built-in. Let’s in fact “build in” all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;letter&lt;/code&gt;, for any Unicode letter&lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt;, for &lt;code&gt;"0".."9"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;alnum&lt;/code&gt;, for &lt;code&gt;letter | digit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;upper&lt;/code&gt;, for any Unicode uppercase letter&lt;code&gt;lower&lt;/code&gt;, for any Unicode lowercase letter&lt;code&gt;hexDigit&lt;/code&gt;, for &lt;code&gt;digit | "a".."f" | "A".."F"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;, for any Unicode character at all&lt;p&gt;Did you notice that some of our syntax categories (Program, Statement, Exp) were capitalized and others (id, numeral, letter, digit) were not? Why did we do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter things are very primitive. They can not have internal spaces. We call these tokens. Think of these as basic “words”. The former, called phrases are more complex. Think of them as sentences. They are made up of tokens that can be separated by spaces. Tokens and phrases are very different, so we should denote them differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are spaces—those characters that can separate tokens from each other? We’ll take them to be any Unicode space character. But we also want to separate tokens with comments. Let’s define how tokens should look in our language, and add them to the special &lt;code&gt;space&lt;/code&gt; category:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;space += "//" (~"\n" any)*&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deeper look into how the lexical and phrase syntaxes differ. As a specific example, this program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;print( // ⿇🌿 420 );&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;is made up of these characters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPACE SPACE LATIN SMALL LETTER P LATIN SMALL LETTER R LATIN SMALL LETTER I LATIN SMALL LETTER N LATIN SMALL LETTER T LEFT PARENTHESIS TAB SOLIDUS SOLIDUS SPACE KANGXI RADICAL HEMP HERB LINEFEED DIGIT FOUR DIGIT TWO DIGIT ZERO SPACE RIGHT PARENTHESIS SEMICOLON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the lexical syntax, skipping the spaces (and comments), we get the token stream:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;num(420)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the phrase syntax, we can uncover the underlying parse tree:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very important thing to note: The frontier of the parse tree is the token stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The parse tree ends at tokens, not characters&lt;lb/&gt;Please take the time to consider how silly it would be if the parse tree expanded all of the lexical rules down to characters. Having the parse tree stop at tokens is a good example of what we would call “breaking a complex problem down into simpler parts.”&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another term for “parse tree” is concrete syntax tree (CST).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How are we doing so far? We are able to distinguish well-structured Astro programs from all other Unicode strings. But there are some things we haven’t dealt with yet. For one, we have some strings with multiple structural forms. For example, the phrase &lt;code&gt;9-3*7&lt;/code&gt; can be parsed in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having more than one parse tree for a given input string means that our syntax description is ambiguous. It’s possible to handle this particular kind of ambiguity in the syntax. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can create rules that force certain operators to be applied before others; that is, the precedence of operators can be enforced in our syntax definition. To do so, we define additional syntactic categories. We say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s revise our syntax specification:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Exp = Term ( ("+" | "-") Term )* Term = Factor ( ("*" | "/" | "%") Factor )* Factor = Primary ( "**" Primary )* | "-" Primary Primary = numeral | id | id "(" (Exp ("," Exp)*)? ")" | "(" Exp ")"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great! Now there is one and only one parse tree for that previously problematic expression:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the new syntax has forced the binary operators into a precedence hierarchy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; have the lowest precedence.&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; have the next higher precedence.&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; has the highest precedence.&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can think of parenthesized expressions as being done before anything else, though we don’t usually think of these as operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-3**2&lt;/code&gt; be parsed? In Python exponentiation precedes negation, like &lt;code&gt;-(3**2)&lt;/code&gt;. In Elm, negation precedes exponentiation, like &lt;code&gt;(-3)**2&lt;/code&gt;. Astro follows JavaScript and simply does not allow this expression (forcing programmers to use parentheses in this case)! Show how this is done.
&lt;code&gt;-3**2&lt;/code&gt; as an expression, but it does allow &lt;code&gt;-3+2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-3*2&lt;/code&gt;. Why did we care only enough to ensure negation did not mix with exponentiation, but we were fine with it mixing with addition and multiplication?
&lt;p&gt;Wait, we are not done with structuring our operators just yet. The way things stand now, the parse tree for &lt;code&gt;3-8-5&lt;/code&gt; looks pretty flat:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t suggest whether we mean to compute &lt;code&gt;(3-8)-5&lt;/code&gt; (which would be -10) or &lt;code&gt;3-(8-5)&lt;/code&gt; (which would be 0). We can give a syntax that makes this clear. In our design, let’s make the additive and multiplicative operators left-associative and the exponentiation operator right-associative:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Exp = Exp ("+" | "-") Term | Term Term = Term ("*" | "/" | "%") Factor | Factor Factor = Primary "**" Factor | "-" Primary | Primary&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the heck does this work? Study these parse trees, and hopefully the insight will come to you! (Hint: remember the syntax is designed to force the tree to “come out” a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notation we’ve been using to precisely describe our syntax is a kind of a grammar. In fact, it is very close to a specific kind of grammar called an Ohm Grammar. Ohm requires a bit more ceremony than what we’ve been using so far. We’ll just jump right in and extend our work so far to a complete and working Ohm grammar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Astro {
  Program     = Statement+
  Statement   = id "=" Exp ";"                         --assignment
              | print Exp ";"                          --print
  Exp         = Exp ("+" | "-") Term                   --binary
              | Term
  Term        = Term ("*" | "/" | "%") Factor          --binary
              | Factor
  Factor      = Primary "**" Factor                    --binary
              | "-" Primary                            --negation
              | Primary
  Primary     = id "(" ListOf&amp;lt;Exp, ","&amp;gt; ")"            --call
              | numeral                                --num
              | id                                     --id
              | "(" Exp ")"                            --parens

  numeral     = digit+ ("." digit+)? (("E" | "e") ("+" | "-")? digit+)?
  print       = "print" ~idchar
  idchar      = letter | digit | "_"
  id          = ~print letter idchar*
  space      += "//" (~"\n" any)*                      --comment
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are designing your language, you will build up your grammar iteratively, from increasingly more complex examples, and test the grammar as you go. Tools will help you here! If you are using Ohm, and you should, take advantage of the use the Ohm Editor. This is an amazing tool for experimenting with programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the upper left panel, design your grammar. You can load/save from your browser’s local storage, and even publish gists to GitHub. In the lower left panel, enter test cases: both tests you want to succeed (thumbs up) and those you want to fail (thumbs down). The right panel is an interactive concrete syntax tree for the currently selected test case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tool will save you a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an essential component of your language design toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;How essential is it?&lt;p&gt;Unless your language is trivial, tools like the Ohm Editor are very important! Design is an iterative process, and creativity is enabled and enhanced with immediate feedback. So you should design with tools that allow you to experiment and test your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it is true that in practice, many production-level compilers do not use Ohm or related tools like ANTLR, Bison, etc.—they do everything by hand. But developers that go this route will write their grammar tests concurrently with their design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Let’s do a code-along with the Ohm Editor for developing the Astro grammar. During the code-along, note how examples are done first, and note how we will evolve from the basics to more complex features, bringing in notions such as a precedence and associativity where needed.&lt;p&gt;During the code-along, bits of Ohm will be introduced as needed. In a subsequence course unit, we will cover Ohm in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question: Does the grammar we defined above for Astro capture the following (desirable) rule:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can only use an identifier if it has been previously assigned to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answer: It does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;print x;&lt;/code&gt; a legal program according to the grammar?
&lt;p&gt;Enforcing this rule requires knowledge of context. That is, the syntactic rule for producing expressions such as calls and arithmetic operations would need to somehow know which identifiers appeared on the left hand side of some previous assignment statement. This turns out to be so hard that even designers of real programming languages omit enforcement of contextual rules from the grammar! In fact, while the official grammar for Java will not derive this program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;class A {2 / == {{;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and report a syntax error, a Java compiler will say that this program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;class A {int x = y;}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is structurally well formed according to the official syntax of the Java language! The compilation unit consists of a type declaration that is a class declaration whose body consists of a field declaration with a type, a name, and an initializing expression which is an identifier. But we know this program is not legal, since the identifier y has not been declared. It’s not only Java that has grammars overspecifying things: pretty much every programming language uses a grammar to define structural rules only, and specifies contextual rules in prose, or in a separate semantic definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Astro, we will “define” the following contextual rules:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;π&lt;/code&gt;, a number&lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt;, a function of exactly one argument&lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt;, a function of exactly one argument&lt;code&gt;cos&lt;/code&gt;, a function of exactly one argument&lt;code&gt;hypot&lt;/code&gt;, a function of exactly two arguments&lt;p&gt;For more complex languages, the statics definition (contextual rules) can be quite large. Here are some things that might appear:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statements may only appear in a loop. &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statements may only appear in a function it’s possible to encode these restrictions in the grammar, but it would be ugly).
  &lt;p&gt;The dynamics for most programming languages are given in prose. If you language is simple enough, a formal semantic definition is possible. For the sample languages in this course, Astro and Bella are given both informal and formal semantic definitions. We’ll not be studying formal semantics at this time, but feel free to study the definitions on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During your language design, you will want to whip up a simple interpreter to at the very least make sure your design is reasonable. You may wish to developer your interpreter in parallel with your language design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohm was designed for prototyping programming languages, so it is a natural choice. The Ohm Editor, as we just saw, helps you design the syntax. To write an actual interpreter, we’ll have to go much deeper into Ohm. We’ll be doing this in our next unit of study in this course, which is, indeed, a deep study of Ohm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many well-known programming languages have published, formal definitions. You can find them by searching the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this class, we will be studying five little languages crafted especially to help you in your stufy of language design and implementation. We will be studying them in order, building upon previous languages and learning new things as we progress. This will allow us to introduce the huge topic of language processing in a practical setting, writing real compilers for real languages. The languages are Astro, Bella, Carlos, Dax, and Ekko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all begin as a white belt in every new endeavor. We will start, then, with a very simple, almost trivial, language. All it has are numbers, arithmetic operators, variables, and a few pre-defined constants and functions. Here’s an example program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// A simple program in Astro rAd1uS = 55.2 * (-cos(2.8E-20) + 89) % 21; the_area = π * rAd1uS ** 2; print(hypot(2.28, 3 - rAd1uS) / the_area); // woohoo 👻&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only two kinds of statements: assignments and print statements. Expressions include numbers, variables, function calls, arithmetic expressions with &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;, and can be parenthesized. We will cover the official definition of the language, and use the language to motivate a formal study of syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When studying this language, we’ll learn about the separation of context-free syntax from contextual rules. Contextual rules include such things as: having to match the number of arguments in a call with the number of defined parameters, rudimentary type checking, and not allowing assignments to read-only variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Astro will be our first language, we will use it as a case study to learn the amazing Ohm Language Library to build an interpreter. The details of how the interpreter is constructed are covered in the course notes on Ohm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our second language has a few things Astro does not: a richer set of operators, variable declarations, and user-defined functions. The contextual rules for Bella are much richer than that of Astro, since we now have actual declarations, and scope! Here’s an example program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;let dozen = 12; print dozen % 3 ** 1; function gcd(x, y) = y == 0 ? x : gcd(y, x % y); while dozen &amp;gt;= 3 || (gcd(1, 10) != 5) { dozen = dozen - 2.75E+19 ** 1 ** 3; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will first look at the official specification, introducing all sorts of interesting concepts. Then we’ll study a real, actual Bella compiler. Here we learn about designing and architecting a compiler, building the components (analyzer, optimizer, and generator), and getting 100% test coverage. The compiler source code is on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our third language, we encounter arrays, structs, and optionals: our first language that is basically useful. If you are taking the compiler course for which these notes were written, Carlos is a good example of the minimal language complexity you will need for your term project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;const languageName = "Carlos"; function greeting() { return random(["Welcome", "こんにちは", "Bienvenido"]); } print("👋👋👋"); repeat 5 { print(greeting() + " " + languageName); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll be visiting the language’s official specification and a compiler on GitHub. The compiler (of course!) uses the Ohm Language Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no separate page of notes describing the compiler. After studying the Astro and Bella compilers, you’ll be able to find your way around the code on GitHub (there’s documentation). And don’t worry, it’s development and usage will be covered in class, and the teaching staff can help you with any questions you might have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language number four is a functional language, that is, a language with no assignments! The only bindings of names to entities happens when passing arguments to parameters, though there is that famous &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; declaration which nicely sugars a function call: it’s nicer to say &lt;code&gt;let x = 5 in x * y end&lt;/code&gt; than &lt;code&gt;{x =&amp;gt; x * y}(5)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sample program to get the feel for the language:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;let gcd = {x =&amp;gt; {y ==&amp;gt; y == 0 ? x : gcd y (x % y)}}; z = 5 in [1, 3, z] |&amp;gt; filter {x =&amp;gt; x &amp;gt; 2} |&amp;gt; map {x =&amp;gt; x ** 2} |&amp;gt; print then "hello" |&amp;gt; substring 2 5 |&amp;gt; print then print (gcd 33 99) // This is fine, you don't HAVE to use |&amp;gt; end&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have not yet seen languages with the awesome &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator, here’s your chance to be wowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will discuss the language design and compiler later in the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our fifth language, Ekko (starting with E like Erlang and Elixir, which greatly influence it), is a kind of experimental language that deals quite a lot with time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ekko mixes styles of asynchronous programming from JavaScript and the distributed process-orientation of Erlang and Elixir: Ekko’s &lt;code&gt;future&lt;/code&gt; objects are based on JS promises, and its processes communicate via messages as in Erlang. There’s also quite a bit more temporal goodness, including timeout calls, value histories with time travel (influenced by older versions of Elm), and even explicit parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students in previous iterations of the course have designed and implemented their own languages. Here’s a sampling of language over the past decade or so. (Please note that there is a very wide variety of quality in these examples. They are presented here without any evaluative commentary as to whether they are suitable building blocks for one’s own project.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions useful for your spaced repetition learning. Many of the answers are not found on this page. Some will have popped up in lecture. Others will require you to do your own research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve covered:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Internet is Cool. Thank you, TCP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An exploration of TCP, the workhorse of the internet. This deep dive includes detailed examples and a step-by-step walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The internet is incredible. It’s nearly impossible to keep people away from. But it can also be unreliable: packets drop, links congest, bits mangle, and data corrupts. Oh, it’s dangerous out there! (I’m writing this in Kramer’s tone)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how is it possible that our apps just work? If you’ve networked your app before, you know the drill: &lt;code&gt;socket()&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;bind()&lt;/code&gt; here, &lt;code&gt;accept()&lt;/code&gt; there, maybe a &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; over there, and it just works. Reliable, orderly, uncorrupted data flows to and fro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Websites (HTTP), email (SMTP) or remote access (SSH) are all built on top of TCP and just work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why TCP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do we need TCP? Why can’t we just use the layer below, IP?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember, the network stack goes: Physical –&amp;gt; Data Link (Ethernet/Wi-Fi, etc) –&amp;gt; Network (IP) –&amp;gt; Transport (TCP/UDP).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IP (Layer 3) operates at the host level, while the transport layer (TCP/UDP) works at the application level using ports. IP can deliver packets to the correct host via its IP address, but once the data reaches the machine, it still needs to be handed off to the correct process. Each process “binds” to a port: its address within the machine. A common analogy is: the IP address is the building, and the port is the apartment. Processes or apps live in those apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another reason we need TCP is that if a router (a piece of infra your average user does not control) drops packets or becomes overloaded, TCP at the edges (on the users’ machines) can recover without requiring routers to participate. The routers stay simple, the reliability happens at the endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Packets get lost, corrupted, duplicated, and reordered. That’s just how the internet works. TCP shields developers from these issues. It handles retransmission, checksums, and a gazillion other reliability mechanisms. If every developer had to implement those themselves, they’d never have time to properly align their flexboxes, a truly horrendous alternate universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jokes aside, the guarantee that data sent and received over a socket isn’t corrupted, duplicated, or out of order, despite the underlying network being unreliable, is exactly why TCP is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flow and Congestion Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you step back and think about network communication, here’s what we’re really trying to do: machine A sends data to machine B. Machine B has a finite amount of space and must store the incoming data somewhere before passing it to the application, which might be asleep or busy. This temporary storage takes the name of a receive buffer and is managed by the kernel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_rmem&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 6291456&lt;/code&gt;, a min of 4k, default of 128k and max of 8M.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that space is finite. If you’re transferring a large file (hundreds of MBs or even GBs), you could easily overwhelm the destination. The receiver therefore needs a way to tell the sender how much more data it can handle. This mechanism is called flow control, and TCP segments include a field called the window, which specifies how much data the receiver is currently willing to accept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another issue is overwhelming the network itself, even if the receiving machine has plenty of buffer space. You’re only as strong as your weakest link: some links carry gigabits, others only megabits. If you don’t tune for the slowest link, congestion is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: in 1986, the Internet’s bandwidth dropped from a few dozen KB/s to as low as 40 bps (yes, bits per second! yes, those numbers are wild!), in what became known as congestion collapse. When packets were lost and systems retried sending them, they made congestion even worse: a doom loop. To fix this, TCP incorporated ‘play nice’ and ‘back off’ behaviors known as congestion control, which help prevent the Internet from clogging itself to death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some Code: A Plain TCP Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all low-level things like TCP, C examples are the way to go. Just show it like it is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;

          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;arpa/inet.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;signal.h&amp;gt; int sockfd = -1, clientfd = -1; void handle_sigint(int sig) { printf("\nCtrl+C caught, shutting down...\n"); if (clientfd != -1) close(clientfd); if (sockfd != -1) close(sockfd); exit(0); } int main() { signal(SIGINT, handle_sigint); sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); int opt = 1; // SO_REUSEADDR to force bind to the port even if an older socket is still terminating (TIME_WAIT) setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &amp;amp;opt, sizeof(opt)); struct sockaddr_in addr = { .sin_family = AF_INET, .sin_port = htons(8080), .sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY }; bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(addr)); listen(sockfd, 5); printf("Listening on 8080...\n"); clientfd = accept(sockfd, NULL, NULL); char buf[1024], out[2048]; int n; while ((n = recv(clientfd, buf, sizeof(buf) - 1, 0)) &amp;gt; 0) { buf[n] = '\0'; int m = snprintf(out, sizeof(out), "you sent: %s", buf); printf("response %s %d\n", out, m); send(clientfd, out, m, 0); } close(clientfd); close(sockfd); } &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This create a TCP server that echoes what the client sends prefixed with ‘You sent:’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;# compile and run server gcc -o server server.c &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./server # connect client telnet 127.0.0.1 8080 # hi # you sent: hi &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; (localhost) could be replace with a remote IP and it should work all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used the following primitives/functions follow the Berkley Socket way of doing things (released with BDS 4.2):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SOCKET&lt;/code&gt;: create an endpoint (structure in the kernel).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;BIND&lt;/code&gt;: associate to a port.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;LISTEN&lt;/code&gt;: get ready to accept connection and a specify queue size of pending connection (beyond that size, drop!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ACCEPT&lt;/code&gt;: accept an incoming connection (TCP Server)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONNECT&lt;/code&gt;: attempt connection (TCP client)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SEND&lt;/code&gt;: send data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;RECEIVE&lt;/code&gt;: receive data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLOSE&lt;/code&gt;: release the connection&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the example above, we’re using client/server dynamics in a request/response pattern. But I can add the following after &lt;code&gt;send&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;send(clientfd, out, m, 0); sleep(5); const char *msg = "not a response, just doing my thing\n"; send(clientfd, msg, strlen(msg), 0); &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compile, run, and telnet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;client here you sent: client here client again not a response, just doing my thing you sent: client again &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I typed in the telnet terminal: &lt;code&gt;client here&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;client again&lt;/code&gt;. I only got &lt;code&gt;you sent: client here&lt;/code&gt;, then the server was sleeping. My second line, &lt;code&gt;client again&lt;/code&gt;, was patiently waiting in the receive buffer. The server sent &lt;code&gt;not a response, just doing my thing&lt;/code&gt;, then picked up my second TCP packet and replied with &lt;code&gt;you sent: client again&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very much a duplex bidirectional link. Each side sends what it wishes, it just happens that at the beginning, one listens and the other connects. The dynamics afterwards don’t have to follow a request/response pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Catfishing Curl: A Dead Simple HTTP Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s create a very simple HTTP/1.1 server (later versions are trickier).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt; // same as before printf("Listening on 8080...\n"); int i = 1; while (1) { clientfd = accept(sockfd, NULL, NULL); char buf[1024], out[2048]; int n; while ((n = recv(clientfd, buf, sizeof(buf) - 1, 0)) &amp;gt; 0) { buf[n] = '\0'; int body_len = snprintf(out, sizeof(out), "[%d] Yo, I am a legit web server\n", i++); char header[256]; int header_len = snprintf( header, sizeof(header), "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n" "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n" "Content-Length: %d\r\n" "Connection: close\r\n" "\r\n", body_len ); printf("header: %s\n", header); printf("out: %s\n", out); send(clientfd, header, header_len, 0); send(clientfd, out, body_len, 0); break; // one request per connection } close(clientfd); } &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;~ curl localhost:8080 [1] Yo, I am a legit web server ~ curl localhost:8080 [2] Yo, I am a legit web server &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re using &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to keep count of requests. We’re establishing a TCP connection and returning the HTTP headers expected by the HTTP client (the TCP peer, really). A real HTTP server would return proper HTML, CSS, and JS, and handle a whole lot of other options and headers. But underneath, it’s simply a process making use of our reliable, dependable TCP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Actual Bytes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt; 0 &amp;lt;----- 32 bits ------&amp;gt; 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Source Port | Destination Port | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Sequence Number | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Acknowledgment Number | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Header|Rese-| Flags | Window Size | | Len |rved | | | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Checksum | Urgent Pointer | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Options (if any) | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Data (Payload) | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each TCP segment has the header above. And each TCP segment is contained within a IP packet. We have a source and destination ports. Each 16 bits, and that’s where the 64k port limit comes from!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each transport-layer connection is &lt;code&gt;5-tuple (TCP/UDP, src IP, src port, dst IP, dst port)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sequence and Acknowledgment Numbers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TCP reliability depends on two key fields: the Sequence number, indicating which bytes a segment carries, and the Acknowledgment number, indicating which bytes have been received. Sequence numbers let the receiver interpret data order, detect and reorder out-of-order segments, and identify losses. TCP uses cumulative acknowledgments—an ACK of 100 means bytes 0-99 were received. If bytes 100-120 are lost but later bytes arrive, the ACK remains 100 until the missing data is received.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1. A --&amp;gt; B: Send [Seq=0-99] 2. B --&amp;gt; A: Send [Seq=0-49] 3. B --&amp;gt; A: Receives A's [0-99] --&amp;gt; sends ACK=100 4. A --&amp;gt; B: Receives B's [0-49] --&amp;gt; sends ACK=50 5. A --&amp;gt; B: Send [Seq=100-199] --- lost --- 6. B --&amp;gt; A: Send [Seq=50-99] --- lost --- 7. A --&amp;gt; B: Send [Seq=200-299] B receives --&amp;gt; notices gap (100-199 missing) --&amp;gt; sends ACK=100 8. B --&amp;gt; A: Send [Seq=100-149] A receives --&amp;gt; notices gap (50-99 missing) --&amp;gt; sends ACK=50 9. A --&amp;gt; B: Send [Seq=300-399] B still missing 100-199 --&amp;gt; sends ACK=100 10. B --&amp;gt; A: Send [Seq=150-199] A still missing 50-99 --&amp;gt; sends ACK=50 11. A --&amp;gt; B: Retransmit [Seq=100-199] B receives --&amp;gt; now has 0-399 --&amp;gt; sends ACK=400 12. B --&amp;gt; A: Retransmit [Seq=50-99] A receives --&amp;gt; now has 0-199 --&amp;gt; sends ACK=200 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Header Length shows how many 4-byte words are in the header, needed because the Options field is variable length, and thus so is the header.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TCP Flags&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next are 8 flags (1 bit each). A few important ones:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SYN&lt;/code&gt;: used to establish a connection. &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;: indicates the Acknowledgment number is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two flags are central to connection setup. Why establish a connection? To detect out-of-order or duplicate segments you must track what has been sent and received i.e., maintain a state or a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SYN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; participate in the famous 3-way handshake:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A –&amp;gt; B: &lt;code&gt;SYN&lt;/code&gt;(I want to connect)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;B –&amp;gt; A: &lt;code&gt;SYN&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;(I got your SYN, I want to connect too!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A –&amp;gt; B: &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;(got it, connection established!)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;FIN&lt;/code&gt; flag signals teardown and also uses a handshake:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;X –&amp;gt; Y: &lt;code&gt;FIN&lt;/code&gt;(I want to disconnect)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Y –&amp;gt; X: &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;(got your FIN, whatever!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Y –&amp;gt; X: &lt;code&gt;FIN&lt;/code&gt;(I want to disconnect too - sometimes sent with the previous ACK)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;X –&amp;gt; Y: &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;(got it!)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is normally a 4-way (sometimes 3-way) goodbye handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RST&lt;/code&gt; is the reset flag. It indicates an error or forced shutdown — drop the connection immediately. An OS sends &lt;code&gt;RST&lt;/code&gt; if no process is listening or if the listening process crashed. There’s also a known TCP reset attack where intermediaries inject &lt;code&gt;RST&lt;/code&gt; to terminate connections (used by some firewalls).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Window&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talked about this field in flow control. As mentionned above, this indicates how many bytes the receiver is willing to receive after the acknowledged number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the example above, running &lt;code&gt;ss&lt;/code&gt; (Socket Statistics) provides info about the TCP connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;ss -tlpmi // State Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port Peer Address:Port Process // LISTEN 0 5 0.0.0.0:http-alt 0.0.0.0:* users:(("server",pid=1113,fd=3)) // skmem:(r0,rb131072,t0,tb16384,f0,w0,o0,bl0,d0) cubic cwnd:10 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb131072&lt;/code&gt; (128KB) is the receive buffer size, while &lt;code&gt;tb16384&lt;/code&gt; (16KB) is the transmit buffer size, where data waits before being sent over the network. &lt;code&gt;Send-Q&lt;/code&gt; indicates bytes not yet acknowledged by the remote host, and &lt;code&gt;Recv-Q&lt;/code&gt; shows bytes received but not yet read by the application (e.g., data waiting in from the second line in telnet session above, while the server was sleeping).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Checksum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checksum is used for reliability. All 16-bit words in the TCP segment are added together, and the result is compared to the checksum. If they don’t match, it means some bits were likely corrupted, and retransmission is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It always amazes me how all this works. The network, the internet. Reliably and continuously. Just a few decades ago, sending a few KB was quite the feat. And today, streaming 4k is banal. God bless all those hardworking people that made and make it all possible!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Messing with bots&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As outlined in my previous two posts: scrapers are, inadvertently, DDoSing public websites. I've received a number of emails from people running small web services and blogs seeking advice on how to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post isn't about that. This post is about fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I published my last post, there was an interesting write-up doing the rounds about a guy who set up a Markov chain babbler to feed the scrapers endless streams of generated data. The idea here is that these crawlers are voracious, and if given a constant supply of junk data, they will continue consuming it forever, while (hopefully) not abusing your actual web server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a pretty neat idea, so I dove down the rabbit hole and learnt about Markov chains, and even picked up Rust in the process. I ended up building my own babbler that could be trained on any text data, and would generate realistic looking content based on that data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the AI scrapers are actually not the worst of the bots. The real enemy, at least to me, are the bots that scrape with malicious intent. I get hundreds of thousands of requests for things like &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.aws&lt;/code&gt;, and all the different &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; paths that could potentially signal a misconfigured Wordpress instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These people are the real baddies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally I just block these requests with a &lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt; response. But since they want &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; files, why don't I give them what they want?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I trained my Markov chain on a few hundred &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; files, and set it to generate. The responses certainly look like php at a glance, but on closer inspection they're obviously fake. I set it up to run on an isolated project of mine, while incrementally increasing the size of the generated php files from 2kb to 10mb just to test the waters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a sample 1kb output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php wp_list_bookmarks () directly, use the Settings API. Use this method directly. Instead, use `unzip_file() {
return substr($ delete, then click &amp;amp;#8220; %3 $ s object. ' ), ' $ image
*
*
*
* matches all IMG elements directly inside a settings error to the given context.
* @return array Updated sidebars widgets.
* @param string $ name = "rules" id = "wp-signup-generic-error" &amp;gt; ' . $errmsg_generic . ' &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; ';
	}
	/**
	 * Fires at the end of the new user account registration form.
	 *
	 * @since 3.0.0
	 *
	 * @param WP_Error $errors A WP_Error object containing ' user_name ' or ' user_email ' errors.
	 */
	do_action( ' signup_extra_fields ', $errors );
}

/**

 *
 * @since MU (3.0.0)
 *
 * @return array Contains username, email, and error messages.
 *               See wpmu_validate_user_signup() for details.
 */
function validate_user_form() {
	return wpmu_validate_user_signup( $_POST[' user_name '], $_POST[' user_email '] );
}

/**

 */
function signup_another_blog( $blogname = ' ', $blog_title = ' ', $errors = ' ' ) {
	$current_user = wp_get_current_user();

	if ( ! is_wp_error( $errors ) ) {
		$errors = new WP_Error();
	}

	$signup_defaults = array(
		' blogname '   =&amp;gt; $blogname,
		' blog_title ' =&amp;gt; $blog_title,
		' errors '     =&amp;gt; $errors,
	);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had two goals here. The first was to waste as much of the bot's time and resources as possible, so the larger the file I could serve, the better. The second goal was to make it realistic enough that the actual human behind the scrape would take some time away from kicking puppies (or whatever they do for fun) to try figure out if there was an exploit to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, an arms race of this kind is a battle of efficiency. If someone can scrape more efficiently than I can serve, then I lose. And while serving a 4kb bogus php file from the babbler was pretty efficient, as soon as I started serving 1mb files from my VPS the responses started hitting the hundreds of milliseconds and my server struggled under even moderate loads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This led to another idea: What is the most efficient way to serve data? It's as a static site (or something similar).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So down another rabbit hole I went, writing an efficient garbage server. I started by loading the full text of the classic Frankenstein novel into an array in RAM where each paragraph is a node. Then on each request it selects a random index and the subsequent 4 paragraphs to display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each post would then have a link to 5 other "posts" at the bottom that all technically call the same endpoint, so I don't need an index of links. These 5 posts, when followed, quickly saturate most crawlers, since breadth-first crawling explodes quickly, in this case by a factor of 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see it in action here: https://herm.app/babbler/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very efficient, and can serve endless posts of spooky content. The reason for choosing this specific novel is fourfold:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I was working on this on Halloween.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I hope it will make future LLMs sound slightly old-school and spoooooky.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's in the public domain, so no copyright issues.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I find there are many parallels to be drawn between Dr Frankenstein's monster and AI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made sure to add &lt;code&gt;noindex,nofollow&lt;/code&gt; attributes to all these pages, as well as in the links, since I only want to catch bots that break the rules. I've also added a counter at the bottom of each page that counts the number of requests served. It resets each time I deploy, since the counter is stored in memory, but I'm not connecting this to a database, and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this running, I did the same for php files, creating a static server that would serve a different (real) &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; file from memory on request. You can see this running here: https://herm.app/babbler.php (or any path with &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; in it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a counter at the bottom of each of these pages as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Maury said: "Garbage for the garbage king!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now with the fun out of the way, a word of caution. I don't have this running on any project I actually care about; https://herm.app is just a playground of mine where I experiment with small ideas. I originally intended to run this on a bunch of my actual projects, but while building this, reading threads, and learning about how scraper bots operate, I came to the conclusion that running this can be risky for your website. The main risk is that despite correctly using &lt;code&gt;robots.txt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;nofollow&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;noindex&lt;/code&gt; rules, there's still a chance that Googlebot or other search engines scrapers will scrape the wrong endpoint and determine you're spamming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you or your website depend on being indexed by Google, this may not be viable. It pains me to say it, but the gatekeepers of the internet are real, and you have to stay on their good side, or else. This doesn't just affect your search ratings, but could potentially add a warning to your site in Chrome, with the only recourse being a manual appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this applies only to the post babbler. The php babbler is still fair game since Googlebot ignores non-HTML pages, and the only bots looking for php files are malicious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you have a little web-project that is being needlessly abused by scrapers, these projects are fun! For the rest of you, probably stick with 403s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I've done as a compromise is added the following hidden link on my blog, and another small project of mine, to tempt the bad scrapers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href="https://herm.app/babbler/" rel="nofollow" style="display:none"&amp;gt;Don't follow this link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing I'm worried about now is running out of Outbound Transfer budget on my VPS. If I get close I'll cache it with Cloudflare, at the expense of the counter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a fun little project, even if there were a few dead ends. I know more about Markov chains and scraper bots, and had a great time learning, despite it being fuelled by righteous anger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all threads need to lead somewhere pertinent. Sometimes we can just do things for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;以大键盘为例&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;装配前的前置工作&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;先将4块小PCB使用排线连接至键盘本体PCB，烧录程序。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;安装3-5个轴体，滚轮和轨迹球。装配前确保功能是正常的。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;在打印的外壳与底座对应位置，安装正确的热熔铜螺母。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;键帽印字。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;将棉条贴在定位板突出部分（正反面都有）。&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;第一次烧录固件时，可以按住PCB背面标有 "B" 的按钮，再插入USB线进行固件烧录。&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;若更新固件可以按住键盘上的 "ESC" 键，再插入USB线进行固件烧录。&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;更多可以参考 Flashing Your Keyboard (QMK)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;接下来开始装配&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;将4块小板使用螺丝安装到底座对应位置（注意排线和安装方向），轨迹球座在下方安装螺丝。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;将左右键使用螺丝固定在键盘PCB上。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;从下到上以底棉、轴座棉、键盘PCB、夹心棉、定位板顺序放入底座扇形区域。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;插入按键轴体。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;放入外壳，在下方使用螺丝固定。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;安装键帽，完成装配。&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;螺丝螺母安装指南可以参考这里&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Behind the complaints: Our investigation into the suspicious pressure on Archive.today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;14 Nov 2025 UPD: We have updated the article with more information on the bailiff reports sent to us and the person who ordered them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FBI has been investigating Archive.is (also known as Archive.today), as was recently revealed. The agency issued a subpoena to the site’s domain registrar, asking for information about the person behind it, citing a “federal criminal investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Archive.is was launched in 2012 by someone using the name Denis Petrov — though whether that’s their real identity remains unclear. The site lets users save “snapshots” of web pages by submitting URLs, which makes it a valuable tool for preserving content that might otherwise disappear. But because it can also be used to bypass paywalls, it’s long been a thorn in the side of many media organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the exact nature of the FBI investigation hasn’t been confirmed, it is speculated it can be related to copyright or CSAM (child sexual abuse material) dissemination issues. Altogether, the situation suggests growing pressure on whoever runs Archive.is, and on intermediaries that help make its service accessible. AdGuard DNS, as it turns out, may have just become one such pressure point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we got entangled&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we were contacted by a representative of an organization called the Web Abuse Association Defense, a French group claiming to fight against child pornography. Their website is webabusedefense.com, and here is the archived version as of November 7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They demanded that we block the domain &lt;code&gt;archive.today&lt;/code&gt; (and its mirrors) in AdGuard DNS, alleging that the site’s admin had refused to remove illegal content since 2023. To be clear, Archive.today allows users to take “snapshots” of any webpages, including potentially illegal material. In such cases, it’s the site admin’s job to respond to complaints and promptly remove that content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This struck us as strange — we’re not a hosting provider, and it seemed unusual for an infrastructure-level service like ours to be asked to take action like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon after, the situation escalated into what we could only describe as direct threats:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We won’t share all the screenshots here, but there were several similar messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We sought legal advice, and unfortunately discovered that French law, specifically Article 6-I-7 of the Loi pour la Confiance dans l'Économie Numérique (LCEN), might actually require us to respond and apply blocking measures, at least for French users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, this whole situation shows just how inadequate this regulation is. Such decisions should be made by a court — a private company shouldn’t have to decide what counts as “illegal” content under threat of legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even so, the story didn’t quite add up. Since someone was trying to pressure us into taking action, we decided to contact the other side, Archive.today, directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We sent an email to Archive.today’s contact address and asked two simple questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can they remove the illegal content from the URLs we were informed about?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is it true that they refused to remove such content in the past, and had they been notified about it before?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They replied within a few hours. The response was straightforward: the illegal content would be removed (and we verified that it was), and they had never received any previous notifications about those URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, they hinted that Archive.today had been targeted by a campaign of “serial” complaints, supposedly from French organizations, sent to various companies and institutions that could potentially harm the site. They even shared a link demonstrating a complaint similar to the one we had received.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, things were looking increasingly odd, so we decided to dig deeper into the “complainant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Web Abuse Association Defense website references several well-known organizations — Europol, OFAC, NCA — yet provides no details or evidence of any cooperation with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The association itself was registered in February–March 2025, around the same time its website appeared. There is very little public information about it. Interestingly, registering an association in France can apparently be done entirely online and does not require proof of identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The association is registered at an address used for mass company registration, which isn’t inherently problematic but it does indicate that the entire registration process could have been carried out online by a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its Twitter/X account appeared only recently — in August 2025. It has just four followers, and its feed consists of just a few reposts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of this proves anything by itself, but something still doesn’t add up. In their first email, the “head” of the association claimed that their correspondence with Archive.today started with a bailiff report from 2023. That timeline simply doesn’t fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We examined the so-called “bailiff reports” they had sent us as evidence. It’s important to note that these aren’t bailiff reports in the English sense — they’re “constat d’huissier sur Internet,” official records of online content such as webpages, posts, or videos. These particular reports were ordered online via the service called Qualijuris, and, based on the timestamps, most of them were also created in August 2025 — not 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only two of these bailiff reports were ordered in 2023 from a similar service. What’s interesting is that they weren’t ordered by WAAD. The name of the person who ordered these bailiff reports matches the name that appears in the correspondence shared with us by the Archive.today administrator — the same one he wrote about on X in 2024. In that case, the complaint appeared to come from a real lawyer — but someone had registered a domain with the lawyer’s surname, containing nothing but a redirect to the lawyer’s actual website, and did it on the same day the complaint was sent. The domain was used solely to send the emails and it is not active anymore. Interestingly, that email also invoked the LCEN law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what is the link between WAAD and that lawyer from before? Are these bailiff reports real and could it be that this is a case of impersonation of a real person? We don’t know yet, but we hope to discover the truth soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we couldn’t dig any deeper about who exactly is behind WAAD. The domain &lt;code&gt;webabusedefense.com&lt;/code&gt; is registered with name.com, but ownership information (including historical records) is hidden. They use ProtonMail for email, so that’s another dead end. The site itself is behind Cloudflare, making further tracing impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What we have in the end&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With everything said and done, here’s where things stand now:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The illegal content was promptly removed from Archive.today after we notified them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The complaints against the site look extremely suspicious. In our case, they came from an organization that was only recently registered that seems deliberately set up to hide the identities of those behind it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The sample complaint shared by Archive.today’s admin shows signs of impersonating a real person. We have contacted the person in question and are currently waiting for a reply.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In both our case and that other example, the recipients were pressured to act under the French LCEN law. However, that same law also provides penalties for false reports: &lt;p&gt;Art. 6-I-4 LCEN:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;4. Any person who presents content or activity to the persons referred to in paragraph 2 as being illegal with the aim of having it removed or its dissemination stopped, when they know this information to be inaccurate, shall be punished by one year’s imprisonment and a fine of €15,000.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We believe there are indications of criminal behavior here that should be investigated by law enforcement. Therefore, we will file an official complaint with the French police, including all relevant details.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All this is unfolding amid reports of an FBI investigation into the owner of Archive.today. It seems that this investigation may be related to CSAM hosting. While we can’t confirm any connection between that case and ours, the timing is certainly suspicious.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Something like this has probably happened to you recently, maybe even today:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You spilled your coffee while rushing out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You struggled to change a setting on your phone, only to give up in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You got a bug bite, or sunburn, or stubbed your toe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You had to stand in a long line or wait in traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone spoke (or chewed gum, or slammed a door) too loudly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone interrupted or ignored you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are not the kind of events that disrupt the course of your life. But they are all annoying, and sometimes bothersome enough that they could set the tone for the rest of your day. Annoying experiences like these have also been dubbed ‘micro-stresses’ or ‘daily hassles’. They usually come your way unexpectedly, cause you some stress, and interrupt your flow. Though they are minor compared with, say, a personal attack, an injury or a significant loss, I’ve seen in my work as a psychologist how often people struggle to tolerate annoying things or underestimate their impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s quite likely that you’ve been told ‘don’t sweat the small stuff’ and ‘focus on the bigger picture’. Despite our best efforts, though, many of us sometimes find it hard to shrug off the lingering emotional effect of an annoying experience. Making it worse, you might judge yourself for not being able to just let it go. Even if a particular stressor seems insignificant on its own, annoying experiences can have a cumulative effect. Like drops filling a bucket, they can eventually spill over until you’re suddenly snapping at someone, or tearing up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research suggests that accumulated stressors might take a toll in other ways too. For example, a study in the 1980s found that people who experience more daily hassles report greater fatigue, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More recently, researchers have shown that increased stress and hassles significantly predicted the consumption of high-fat and high-sugar snack foods, with implications for physical health. And clinical researchers found that people who reported high levels of daily hassles were significantly more likely to develop generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder or panic disorder over a follow-up period of several years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Annoying experiences are a normal, inevitable part of life. So, whether you’re concerned about their cumulative impact on your wellbeing or just want to reduce the frustration you feel in the moment, there is value in learning to handle annoying things better. This is where evidence-based psychological skills are handy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), there’s an important distinction between unavoidable pain and avoidable pain. Micro-stressors such as running late, spilling something on your shirt or receiving a curt text message represent the unavoidable pain that comes with being human. Daily hassles happen. But how you choose to respond to those moments determines whether you add to the stress. Skills grounded in ACT – which I’ll draw from in the rest of this Guide – can help you reduce the avoidable pain that often comes with aversive experiences, including common annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that ACT can be effective in managing various forms of psychological distress, including those stemming from daily hassles. I’ve seen this happen in my own therapy practice. One client, for example, used to become agitated by his neighbour’s dog barking at random hours of the day and night. Despite his attempt to address the problem by talking to his neighbour, the dog wasn’t going anywhere, and neither was his frustration. Over time and with practice, though, he began to approach the barking with a kind of detachment. The dog didn’t stop barking, but what changed was his ability to pause, notice his frustration, and apply coping skills of the sort I’ll be describing here. That made all the difference. With practice, you too can learn to relate to annoyances in a more skilful way, whatever your next ‘barking dog’ might be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key points&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be hard to shrug off annoying experiences. Many hassles can’t be avoided, but you can avoid the extra layer of pain that often comes with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embrace ‘radical acceptance’. When frustrations arise, practise simply recognising the reality of what’s happened rather than resisting it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make room for your emotions. Notice and name how you feel. If your emotions prompt you to react, ask yourself if that action would really reflect how you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Centre yourself. If you still feel tense or agitated, try a 60-second reset such as belly breathing or ‘tense and release’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commit to acting based on your values. Recalling a core value can guide you toward more constructive responses to annoying experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embrace ‘radical acceptance’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s natural to want to fix or undo the annoyances you encounter. But insisting that a frustrating experience shouldn’t have happened doesn’t change that it did happen. What it does do is deepen your stress. It’s like tugging on a locked door: tiring and ineffective. That’s why you need radical acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Life’s little stressors can feel like a series of tiny battles. If you get lost in knee-jerk responses such as wishful thinking (I wish this weren’t happening), rumination (Why did that happen?), self-blame (Why am I so careless?), or blaming others (They ruined my day), it keeps you stuck in your head, takes you away from the present, and prolongs your unpleasant emotions. Instead of just feeling irritated about a lost key or a rude comment, you end up dealing with extra mental fatigue, shame or resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radical acceptance means recognising the reality of what has occurred without resisting it. It doesn’t mean you approve of what’s happened. It simply means you’re no longer fighting something that can’t be changed. It is about laying down your weapons and saying to yourself: This is happening. How can I work with it without getting lost in it? You’re choosing to no longer let it set the tone for your day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few prompts you can use as gentle reminders to practise radical acceptance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how things have unfolded right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t go back and change what’s happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fighting what happened only fuels my pain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I resist the past, I lose the present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now is the only moment I can shape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how radical acceptance looks in action: you lose your keys. Instead of spiralling into thoughts like Why does this always happen? or This is just what I need right now, you pause and tell yourself something like: This is not ideal. But I don’t want to get stuck on this right now. I’m going to take a breath and calmly retrace my steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you stop resisting reality, you give yourself room to move on with your day, not by denying the frustration, but by refusing to add to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make room for your emotions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emotions are like waves that rise, crest and gently fade away, often within minutes, especially when you give them the space to do so. Each emotion naturally urges you to respond. When you act based on these feelings, it’s called emotion-driven behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, small hassles can trigger big emotional reactions, leading you to quickly engage in emotion-driven behaviours. Have you ever watched someone cut in line at a store? Maybe you experienced a sudden rush of irritation and found yourself glaring at the person, mumbling your disapproval, or speaking curtly to a store employee who wasn’t even aware of the cutting. As natural as it is, automatically doing what a momentary emotion pushes you to do can sometimes take you further away from being the kind of person you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can do instead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice your feelings: emotions live in our bodies first. If you misplace something important, you might feel a knot in your stomach, or your heart racing. When that happens, ask yourself: what am I feeling and sensing right now? Simply noticing your feelings and sensations might seem like a passive response, but it is critical for minimising your entanglement with unpleasant mental content, and it can help you respond to stressors more thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Name your feelings: take your noticing one step further. You don’t need a poet’s vocabulary to name your feelings; a short and sweet label works. I’m feeling frustrated. Or: This is anxiety. You can even imagine that you’re introducing a friend to your feelings: Meet my annoyance. It’s here because the line at the café is moving slower than a sloth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check the workability of your response: within the ACT model, ‘workable’ actions are the ones that are aligned with your personal values and goals. Basically,the idea is that every behaviour takes you closer to or further away from the life you want to build for yourself. So, you must ask yourself whether doing what an emotion pushes you to do in the moment would get you closer to that or further from it. You might ask yourself, for example: If I yell at this barista for getting my order wrong, does that help me live the way I want to live? Or: If I fixate on this person’s annoying hiccups, will it serve me later on?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workability is less about what works in a conventional or problem-solving sense, and more about what works for you in relation to your values. It is a question of inner alignment and direction. An impulsive response to feeling annoyed – such as cursing at someone, slamming a door, or texting a snarky message – might bring you temporary comfort, but it isn’t workable if it pulls you away from your values. (As I will describe below, you can also use your values, rather than just your momentary emotions, to guide more workable responses.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is one more example to demonstrate all these ways of making room for emotions without letting them dictate your behaviour. Let’s say you’re stuck in traffic, and you feel the frustration building. You can first notice what you are feeling in your body. Then you can name the emotion(s) you are feeling (I’m feeling annoyed, and also powerless). Finally, you can ask yourself about the workability of what you feel the urge to do: Will honking randomly at other drivers help me be the person I want to be? You can make space for what you are feeling and still make a choice about what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Centre yourself&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, even if you have applied the preceding skills, you might find yourself tense, restless or stirred up. Centring practices offer you a simple and powerful way to return to a place of steadiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 60-second reset is a versatile skill to help you pause and ground yourself. It has multiple variations. I suggest you try out each of the suggestions below, practising one of them for 60 seconds when an annoying experience leaves you agitated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feel your feet. Bring your attention to the soles of your feet. Imagine roots anchoring you to the earth beneath you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Belly breathing. Place a hand on your stomach, inhale deeply for a count of 4, hold for 2, and exhale slowly for a count of 6. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ground through touch. Press your palms together firmly, or grip the edge of a table or chair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sigh it out. Take a long, audible exhale, like a balloon slowly deflating. Let your body soften with the breath. Breathe in and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quietly hum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tense and release. Clench your fists for 7 seconds, then let go for 14 seconds. Repeat a few times to release pent-up tension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that these centring activities aren’t just quick, temporary fixes. Each one helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system – the branch responsible for rest, relaxation and restoring calm. With regular practice, these exercises can help you gradually build your capacity to handle daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commit to acting based on your values&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Values, in ACT, are freely chosen qualities of being that reflect how you truly want to live and behave. Your values are your compass. You can think of them as verbs, as ongoing patterns of action. For example, you might recognise ‘being caring’ as one of your most important values. In day-to-day life, you could turn this into specific, values-based actions such as a weekly check-in with your neighbour or a phone call with your friend to see how they are doing. There are concrete steps you can take to put your value into practice; to actively live out your value, rather than just thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your values matter when you have annoying experiences because they give you a direction to move in. If you’re feeling irritated by an itchy bug bite after a hike that already wasn’t going the way you planned, you might call to mind your core values and remember that being patient with yourself is one of them. If you’re struggling with setting a ‘smart’ thermostat at home, you might remind yourself that you value being curious, and then decide to search for some pointers online (rather than giving up or slamming the wall in frustration). If you’re annoyed that someone isn’t listening to what you’re saying, you might recall that you value being compassionate, and then ask, respectfully, if they can give you their full attention. These would all be examples of ‘workable’ responses that help you be the kind of person you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think for a moment of Elena. She’s working out of her office at home, midway through an important work assignment, when suddenly, outside her window, a parked delivery truck starts beeping loudly and won’t stop. She notices her heart beating faster and a rush of heat flushing her body. She acknowledges the stress to herself (This is causing me stress right now). Although she has the urge to pound her fist on the desk and even shout at the delivery driver, she pauses instead and asks whether that would serve her. She realises she’s actually faced a few frustrations today, and she takes a minute to centre herself, using the ‘sigh it out’ exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She also asks herself, what really matters right now? And, as she answers that question, Elena taps into her values of being compassionate and being flexible. Knowing the driver is just doing their job and will probably depart soon, she fetches her earbuds to help block out the distracting noise until it passes. She resumes her work, feeling like she’s already started to release the stress she was feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the practices I’ve shared, I hope you’ll find that, as disruptive as little annoyances like these can be, they also present everyday opportunities to live in a way that’s more closely aligned with your values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When are you extra-sensitive to annoyance?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although hassles can arise at any time, you might find that certain contexts leave you feeling especially vulnerable to irritation. Perhaps it’s during your morning routine, or when there is an unexpected change of plans, or while you are preparing meals. Some physiological states, such as fatigue, overstimulation or a lack of sleep, can also be precipitants of annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Becoming aware of your own ‘tender times’ or vulnerability factors can help you anticipate them so that you can respond more gently to annoying things when they pop up. This is why I often invite my therapy clients to get curious about these patterns as they happen. One client, for instance, realised that the middle of the day, when his energy was running low, tended to be his most reactive time. Another client noticed that his tender time was when he arrived home from work, emotionally exhausted after a long day of talking to people in distress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See if you can recognise the contexts that seem most conducive to frustration for you. This is not about getting rid of frustration or irritability altogether during these times, or trying to control your daily hassles. It’s about entering these situations with an awareness of what makes them challenging – and remembering to practise the skills you’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meeting annoyance with self-compassion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to be less easily rattled by annoyances going forward, practising self-compassion can also help. Self-compassion is treating yourself with kindness in difficult moments, staying present with what you’re feeling, and remembering that struggling is part of being human. It’s like talking to yourself the way you’d talk to a friend who’s having a rough day. People who practise self-compassion tend to be more emotionally steady, bounce back faster, and worry less. The psychologist Mark Leary and his team found that self-compassion acts like a shield, helping people handle little irritations without getting overwhelmed by them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are different ways to practise self-compassion, and you can choose the forms that feel right for you. There are longer, more formal exercises like loving-kindness meditations or journaling, for example. There are also brief and practical ways to bring self-compassion into your day; in my podcast, I refer to these practices as self-compassion on-the-go. To practise self-compassion anytime, anywhere – including when you’re dealing with everyday hassles – all you need to do is acknowledge how you feel and check what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picture this: you’re stuck in a slow-moving line, or you’re cooking dinner and your partner says something that rubs you the wrong way. After you first name what you feel, as I recommended earlier (eg, This is frustrating or That comment really bugs me), you then ask yourself: How can I respond to myself with kindness? You might also ask yourself what you need to hear at that moment, or what a kind friend would say to you. All it takes is a little willingness to be gentle with yourself, even if just for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Links and books&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a doer, a striver, or a person who deeply cares about doing things the right way, check out my bookAcceptance and Commitment Skills for Perfectionism and High-Achieving Behaviors (2021). It will help you to compassionately and skilfully manage the frustration that arrives when things don’t go as planned, when people behave in ways they shouldn’t, or when you make mistakes despite your best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you someone who feels things intensely, and who sometimes acts too quickly? For you, annoyances might easily escalate into emotional storms. My bookEscaping the Emotional Roller Coaster: ACT for the Emotionally Sensitive (2018) teaches evidence-based skills, drawn from acceptance and commitment therapy, to help you deal with overwhelming emotions without getting swept away by them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To learn more about acceptance and commitment skills, particularly as they apply to anxiety-based struggles, you can read my newsletter, Playing-it-safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading Paul Gilbert’s bookThe Compassionate Mind (2009) will help you develop self-compassionate practices, improve your emotional wellbeing, and deepen your understanding of why compassion is essential for self-regulation and resilience in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you live in an urban environment and you’d like practical tools to convert daily stress into opportunities for calm, fulfilment and mindful presence, I invite you to read the bookUrban Mindfulness: Cultivating Peace, Presence, and Purpose in the Middle of It All (2010) by Jonathan Kaplan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, if managing annoyances leads you to self-criticism, I encourage you to check out Laura Silberstein-Tirch’s bookHow to Be Nice to Yourself (2019) for a series of exercises from mindfulness and acceptance-based approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post describes my experience using Linux on the Fujitsu Lifebook U729. The tl;dr is that it’s a delightful laptop, and Linux runs flawlessly, and all the hardware things I’ve needed run OOTB. The only difficulty I had was in disabling Secure Boot, but I figured out how to do it, which I explain below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From early 2024 my daily driver was an M2 MacBook Air, until earlier this year I broke the screen, and the repair was quoted at almost 1000 AUD. Since I used it as a desktop most of the time, this didn’t affect me much. After some flip-flopping I decided to get an M4 Mac mini. Partly for the faster CPU and more RAM, but partly because I liked the idea of LARPing like it’s the 2000s, when computers, and by extension the Internet, where fixed in physical space, rather than following everyone around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course this was a terrible idea. I had three working computers—a Linux+Windows desktop, a Mac Mini, and a MacBook Air that I could use as a desktop—and none of them were portable. When I went to RustForge 2025 I just brought my phone. If I wanted to travel, even within Sydney, to a demo night or math club or some such, I didn’t have a laptop to bring with me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I needed a new laptop. And the Tahoe release of macOS was so ugly (see e.g. 1, 2, 3) it made me boot up the old Linux desktop, and start playing around with NixOS again. And I fell in love with Linux again: with the tinkering and the experimentation and the freedom it affords you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I wanted a Linux laptop. I had a ThinkPad X1 some years ago and it was terribly: flimsy plastic build and hardware that vastly underperformed its price. I looked around for old, refursbished workstation laptops, and, randomly, I ran into an eBay seller offering a refurbished Fujitsu laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The specs/price ratio was pretty good: 16 GiB of RAM and 512GiB of SSD, all for 250 AUD. And it was 12in and 1.1kg, which I like: laptops should be small and lightweight. But the thing that got me, in all honesty, was the brand. “Fujitsu laptop” sounds like colour in a William Gibson novel: “crawling into the avionics bay, Case took out a battered Fujitsu refurb, and stuck a JTAG port in the flight computer—”. I already use NixOS and a trackball and a mechanical keyboard, so a laptop that’s even more obscure than a ThinkPad is perfect for me. And it was only 250 AUD. So I got it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only problem I had was disabling Secure Boot in order to install Linux. Otherwise: I love it. It’s small and lightweight, feels solid, the keyboard is good, all the hardware works out of the box with NixOS, and the battery life is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section describes the problems I encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secure Boot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to install Linux the usual way, when I was greeted by this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going into the BIOS, the option to disable Secure Boot was greyed out. I tried a bunch of random bullshit: wiping the TPM, disabling the TPM. That didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What did work was this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, install Windows 11. This came with the laptop. And the installation makes installing Linux feel easy: I had to do so many weird tricks to avoid having to create an account with Microsoft during the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once Windows is installed, go into Windows Update. Under “Advanced Options &amp;gt; Optional Updates”, there should be an option to install Fujitsu-specific drivers. Install those. And for good measure, do a general Windows update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There should be a program called DeskUpdate on the Desktop. This is the Fujitsu BIOS update tool. Run this and go through the instructions: this should update the BIOS (the ordering seems to be important: first update the Fujitsu firmware through Windows Update, then the BIOS through DeskUpdate).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reboot and go into the BIOS (F2). You should have a new BIOS version. In my case, I went from BIOS 2.17 to 2.31 which was released on 2025-03-28:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You now have the option to disable Secure Boot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this, I was able to install NixOS from a live USB:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Spyware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The laptop comes with this corporate spyware thing called Absolute Persistence. It’s some anti-theft tracking device. Since the Lifebook is typically an enterprise laptop, it makes sense that it comes with this type of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only noticed this because I was searching the BIOS thoroughly for a way to disable Secure Boot. The good news is disabling it is pretty straightforward: you just disable it in the BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I understand it, Absolute Persistence requires an agent running in the OS, so the BIOS support, by itself, doesn’t do anything once disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Non-Problems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following work flawlessly OOTB:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WiFi&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bluetooth&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose you have $100 to invest in two independent assets, A and B, and you want to minimize volatility. Suppose A is more volatile than B. Then putting all your money on A would be the worst thing to do, but putting all your money on B would not be the best thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The optimal allocation would be some mix of A and B, with more (but not all) going to B. We will formalize this problem and determine the optimal allocation, then generalize the problem to more assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Two variables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let X and Y be two independent random variables with finite variance and assume at least one of X and Y is not constant. We want to find t that minimizes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;subject to the constraint 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Because X and Y are independent,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking the derivative with respect to t and setting it to zero shows that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the smaller the variance on Y, the less we allocate to X. If Y is constant, we allocate nothing to X and go all in on Y. If X and Y have equal variance, we allocate an equal amount to each. If X has twice the variance of Y, we allocate 1/3 to X and 2/3 to Y.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multiple variables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now suppose we have n independent random variables Xi for i running from 1 to n, and at least one of the variables is not constant. Then we want to minimize&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;subject to the constraint&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and all ti non-negative. We can solve this optimization problem with Lagrange multipliers and find that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. These (n − 1) equations along with the constraint that all the ti sum to 1 give us a system of equations whose solution is&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the denominator has a name: the (n − 1)st elementary symmetric polynomial in n variables. More on this in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the human world, wealth inequality arguably has more of an impact on lives and relationships than physical differences like distance and energy. We need to have meaningful discussions about structural class differences, and segmenting the population based on wealth is an obvious starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wealth, like most quantities, doesn’t need precision beyond the exponent to expose some sharp differences between wealth classes, and sharp similarities within a wealth class.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not useful to compare relative wealth within a wealth level, except perhaps to say “lower” (at risk of falling to a lower level) or “upper” (the next level higher is within reach). For wealth specifically, using any further precision easily leads to direct wealth comparisons between members of the same level, which then leads to jealousy and discontent, rather than insight into the core issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the quantitative treatment, we need to anchor the scale, but using exact values is not possible due to inflation. On a mag scale, inflation happens pretty slowly (↑1.5 from 1900-2025 in the US–about 30x), but this consistent drift can’t be ignored, even in Mag World.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This scale is calibrated on US dollars in the early 1980s; this aligns with some basic cultural expectations around wealth. For instance, that a dollar can still buy something useful, and that a “millionaire” is considered wealthy. To translate 2024 US dollars into mag wealth, divide by 3 (or ↑0.5).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All dollar values are given in 2024 US dollars for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These wealth levels have existed throughout human history, even though the unit of currency changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the bottom-most level, a person can’t even scrape together a few bucks for some food. Societal services aren’t accessible unless they are completely free. Finding a toilet and shower may be difficult. They have no possessions; their shoes and coat are probably decrepit and dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ↑0 wealth, a person can’t pull together $30.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daily shelter and sustenance are at the mercy of other people. If they are not sleeping on the streets, then they are in public shelters, or squatting, or staying with relatives. (Few people will provide long-term housing for a friend with no money.) They need to hustle every single day for their needs, whether through mooching or begging or stealing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Employment is not possible without support; even day-laborers need breakfast and transportation to the pickup site. Without a permanent address you can’t even donate blood plasma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People at this level can’t borrow money, even from friends and relatives, because any lender would be foolish to expect repayment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ↑1 wealth, a person can reliably scrape together $10, maybe $50 or $100, but they might have to sell their body or blood to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Housing at ↑1 is almost as tenuous as ↑0. If not living out of their car, they are couch-surfing; if they have a permanent address, they are living with someone else and paying a low or flexible amount of rent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They may not have a bank account, or if they do, it is in danger of being overdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they have a car, it’s a junker, and it has less than a quarter tank of gas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They work odd jobs. They might get a windfall of $300 from a generous client or a lottery scratch-off ticket, but they would likely spend it immediately on essentials they have been putting off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hard drugs are plentiful at this level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ↑1, no institution will lend them any amount of money, though friends or relatives might. Church and religious community can be very helpful with food banks and meal services, even if the recipient isn’t religious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ↑2 wealth, a person could probably pull together a few thousand dollars, but it would likely involve a substantial amount of hustle and/or usury.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People at ↑2 wealth have some kind of steady employment, maybe minimum wage, and they make enough money to have a permanent address. They get benefits at their employer’s discretion (so probably not).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ↑2 a bank account becomes necessary, to deposit paychecks and pay bills. It can be a challenge to avoid bank overdrafts. They are likely to have bad credit or no credit, and use a debit card. If they need money and are upper ↑2, they may have a credit card with a small limit. At lower ↑2 they might get a payday loan. They probably can’t or shouldn’t pay it off straight from their bank account, because they need to make sure rent and groceries are paid first. Basic money management skills like budgeting and cashflow are required to move from lower ↑2 to upper ↑2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A hallmark of ↑2 is unstable housing and/or rotating roommates. Good and cheap situations are hard to come by, and when they do, they don’t generally last, so people at ↑2 wealth are often have to move frequently. Sometimes they find a stable situation that’s cheap enough, but it’s sketchy or unpleasant or both, and they put up with it because it’s the best of bad options. Often this involves a roommate; more than 2 (non-family) roommates is almost inherently an unstable configuration, which increases roommate turnover too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Living with immediate family is common. If they live alone, it is in subsidized housing, or a very small studio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ↑2, they can’t maintain their life for more than a month without working or outside support (possibly unemployment). Vacations are exclusively long weekends or during holidays. A week off work is a luxury and a 2 week vacation abroad would be a once-in-a-lifetime event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They can buy a nice little thing for themselves here and there. They probably feel guilty about it. They appreciate gifts of nice things they can technically afford but wouldn’t buy themselves. But not expensive things. It’s hard enough to get money to repair or replace items that break down, so durable goods are often in a state of disrepair. They can’t reasonably sell an expensive item to replace things they might need more; and if the expensive item itself breaks, repairs will be more expensive. So a ↑3 gift (some thousands of dollars) would be kind of overwhelming to someone at ↑2, unless it’s a car. A gift that cost more than ↑3 would be weird or confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the US, people at ↑2 are generally eligible for some kind of government assistance, and have more ability to collect it reliably: food stamps, Section 8 housing. But many programs restrict assets to ↑2 (Medicaid is restricted to having less than $2000 in the bank).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;↑3 wealth is lower-middle class. They can pull together a few thousand bucks if their car breaks down, but it hurts. They can buy a used car if they have to replace it, or a new car on a payment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Credit cards and car loans are the hallmarks of this level: people are likely to have more creditors than bank accounts. If they are lower ↑3 they carry credit card debt and may have to juggle some things around to fund an emergency expense. If they are upper ↑3 they can manage to carry an extra balance for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One big unexpected expense could put them deep into debt, which is one way they could become stuck here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They rent and their housing situation has been stable for years. They can make a deliberate choice about where to live and could even move cities, but that’s uncommon at this level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they lose their job, it’s financially stressful, but they can make it a few months without income. Upper ↑3 could even make it a year if they maxed out their credit cards. They generally can choose where to work, and to leave terrible work environments. Their hours are dictated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;↑4 wealth is middle class. This includes young professionals, middle-aged small business owners, and older tradesmen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ↑4, they have a foothold in society; shrewd operators can climb from here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unburdened by debt (or only having “smart” debt, like low-interest fixed-rate loans), they have probably 6 months savings, the start of a retirement account, they’re doing the financial things you’re supposed to do. They probably dabble in investing, if only with that retirement account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are a relatively recent (under 10 years) home-owner, or they rent a decent place. They have an extra bedroom as an office or for guests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They have the first taste of relative freedoms. They can take longer and/or more frequent vacations; a month for a significant overseas trip is not out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They may have bought a new car, but it’s probably not fancy unless they’re showing off. They either own property or are looking for property or saving up to buy property.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they lose their job or their business is not doing well, they can last a year, maybe a few more if they are at upper ↑4 or can reduce their expenses to ↑3 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ↑5 wealth, a person is upper-middle class; they can pull together hundreds of thousands of dollars. Enough to buy a house and live comfortably. Money is no longer the primary obstacle in their life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’ve figured out the things they want, and they can have them. Not the best of everything, but the best of some things, the things that matter to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They have a money market account and know how to trade equities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they need a substantial amount of money, they can borrow from their retirement accounts, mortgage their house, or sell some investments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they are older, they are retired, and they may be able to leave some ↑4 or even ↑5 wealth to their children. If younger, they may not be able to retire, but they also don’t have to work this year, or the next, or the next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A person with lower ↑6 wealth is a “high-net-worth individual” (HNWI, $1m), and a person with upper ↑6 wealth is a “very-high-net-worth individual” (VHNWI, $5m).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colloquially, they’re “rich”. Employment is generally optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do they bank? Where do they live? What kind of debt and other monetary instruments do they use?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 16 million people (↑7) are designated as HNWI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A person with ↑7 wealth is an “ultra-high-net-worth individual” (UHNWI, $30m+). About 250,000 people (↑5.5) are designated as UHNWI, with over 10% of the world’s wealth combined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a huge amount of money: 10x more wealthy than merely “rich”. This is absolutely generational wealth–buying any kind of normal thing, even a house, won’t even make a dent in their wealth. In fact, ↑6 and ↑7 things usually retain or appreciate their value over time (like real estate or fine art).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UHNW individuals “have, on average, eight cars and three or four homes. Three-quarters own a jet aircraft and most have a yacht.” (2006)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They have staff, to manage their money and their properties (multiple). If they have children, they have a full-time nanny or au pair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tax management is key at this level. They use offshore tax havens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they need money, they go to their investment bank and borrow against their investments, which might be illiquid, or they don’t want to sell for tax purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proposed “wealth taxes” would only apply to people with at least ↑7 wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ↑8 wealth, a person has hundreds of millions of dollars. At ↑8.5 wealth they become a “billionaire”. In 2024, about 50,000 people (↑4.5) have ↑8 wealth, including ↑4 billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buy, Borrow, Die is a tax minimization strategy that only works at ↑8 and above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world has always been fascinated by people with ludicrous amounts of wealth and power. Usually there are just a few sovereigns and family dynasties in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1990, about 250 people (↑2.5) had ↑9 wealth. In 2024, about 2500 people (↑3.5) have ↑9 wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1990, the richest people were the Sultan of Brunei (2024US$60b), King Fahd of Saudi Arabia (2024US$43b), and Queen Elizabeth II of England (2024US$28b). Also the Mars family, the Newhouse family, and the Reichmann family with about $30b each. This is ↑10 wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, there are over 200 people with ↑10 wealth. 15 of those people have ↑10.5 wealth (over $100b).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ultra rich as a class have gotten 10x wealthier in the last 30 years, and that’s after adjusting for inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that Forbes only started publishing a list of billionaires in 1987. Prior to that, they just did an article on the “worlds richest people” (1983) separated into three strata (lower ↑8, upper ↑8, ↑9) without maintaining a complete and ordered list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some lists of the wealthiest people in history speculate that Ford, Vanderbilt, Carnegie, and Rockefeller had the equivalent of ↑11 wealth, but that’s when calculated as a percentage of GDP and scaled up. Adjusting for literal inflation, none of them even come close.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A handful of corporations in history, including Dutch East India Company and Standard Oil, had valuations of ↑11. In modern times, it’s Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla at upper ↑11, and another 20 or so companies at lower ↑11 valuations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A country’s “national wealth” is the total value of net wealth owned by its residents. For context, the entire world has ↑14.7 wealth (about $500 trillion).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some facts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, the US budget was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of World War I, the US budget grew 10x in one year (actually it was almost 20x from 1916-1919)! (If you look at the linked spreadsheet, it recedes to ↑9.5 during the Great Depression, before climbing again to ↑10 in 1940.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you can see that from 1910 to 2020, the US budget grew ↑4 (10,000x). This seems like a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But GDP growth was ↑3.5 (from $↑11 in 1930 to $↑14.5 in 2025) over roughly the same time period, and US population growth was ↑0.5 (from ↑8 to ↑8.5 people). This makes sense, that the cost of government scales with its nation’s economy and population.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Factoring in inflation of ↑1.5, we might hypothesize that the US federal budget increased in the past 100 years due to population growth (3x), inflation (30x), and GDP growth (100x). A lot more would have to be done to support this theory, but it’s a very reasonable starting place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no greater geometric solid than the simplex. It is the paragon of efficiency, the pinnacle of symmetry, and the prototype of simplicity. If the universe were not constructed of continuous coordinates, then surely it would be tiled by tessellations of simplices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, simplices, or simplexes, arise in a wide range of geometrical problems and real-world applications. For instance, metallic alloys are described on a simplex to identify the constituent elements [1]. Zero-sum games in game theory and ecosystems in population dynamics are described on simplexes [2], and the Dantzig simplex algorithm is a central algorithm for optimization in linear programming [3]. Simplexes also are used in nonlinear minimization (amoeba algorithm), in classification problems in machine learning, and they also raise their heads in quantum gravity. These applications reflect the special status of the simplex in the geometry of high dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;… It’s Simplexes all the way down!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for their usefulness is the simplicity of their construction that guarantees a primitive set that is always convex. For instance, in any space of d-dimensions, the simplest geometric figure that can be constructed of flat faces to enclose a d-volume consists of d+1 points that is the d-simplex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any space of d-dimensions, the simplex is the geometric figure whose faces are simplexes, whose faces are simplexes, whose faces are again simplexes, and those faces are once more simplexes … And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s simplexes all the way down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Simplex Geometry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this blog, I will restrict the geometry to the regular simplex. The regular simplex is the queen of simplexes: it is the equilateral simplex for which all vertices are equivalent, and all faces are congruent, and all sub-faces are congruent, and so on. The regular simplexes have the highest symmetry properties of any polytope. A polytope is the d-dimensional generalization of a polyhedron. For instance, the regular 2-simplex is the equilateral triangle, and the regular 3-simplex is the equilateral tetrahedron.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The N-simplex is the high-dimensional generalization of the tetrahedron. It is a regular N-dimensional polytope with N+1 vertexes. Starting at the bottom and going up, the simplexes are the point (0-simplex), the unit line (1-simplex), the equilateral triangle (2-simplex), the tetrahedron (3-simplex), the pentachoron (4-simplex), the hexateron (5-simplex) and onward. When drawn on the two-dimensional plane, the simplexes are complete graphs with links connecting every node to every other node. This dual character of equidistance and completeness give simplexes their utility. Each node is equivalent and is linked to each other. There are N•(N-1)/2 links among N vertices, and there are (N-2)•(N-1)/2 triangular faces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Construction of a d-simplex is recursive: Begin with a (d-1)-dimensional simplex and add a point along an orthogonal dimension to construct a d-simplex. For instance, to create a 2-simplex (an equilateral triangle), find the mid-point of the 1-simplex (a line segment)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Centered 1-simplex: (-1), (1)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;add a point on the perpendicular that is the same distance from each original vertex as the original vertices were distant from each other&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Off-centered 2-simplex: (-1,0), (1,0), (0, sqrt(3)/2)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then shift the origin to the center of mass of the triangle&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Centered 2-simplex: (-1, -sqrt(3)/6), (1, -sqrt(3)/6), (0, sqrt(3)/3)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2-simplex, i.e., the equilateral triangle, has a 1-simplex as each of its faces. And each of those 1-simplexes has a 0-simplex as each of its ends. Therefore, this recursive construction of ever higher-dimensional simplexes out of low-dimensional ones, provides an interesting pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The coordinates of an N-simplex are not unique, although there are several convenient conventions. One convention defines standard coordinates for an N-simplex in N+1 coordinate bases. These coordinates embed the simplex into a space of one higher dimension. For instance, the standard 2-simplex is defined by the coordinates (001), (010), (100) forming a two-dimensional triangle in three dimensions, and the simplex is a submanifold in the embedding space. A more efficient coordinate choice matches the coordinate-space dimensionality to the dimensionality of the simplex. Hence the 10 vertices of a 9-simplex can be defined by 9 coordinates (also not unique). One choice is given in Fig. 4 for the 1-simplex up to the 9-simplex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The equations for the simplex coordinates are&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is the “diagonal” vector. These coordinates are centered on the center of mass of the simplex, and the links all have length equal to 2 which can be rescaled by a multiplying factor. The internal dihedral angle between all of the coordinate vectors for an N-simplex is&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For moderate to high-dimensionality, the position vectors of the simplex vertices are pseudo-orthogonal. For instance, for N = 9 the dihedral angle cosine is -1/9 = -0.111. For higher dimensions, the simplex position vectors become asymptotically orthogonal. Such orthogonality is an important feature for orthonormal decomposition of class superpositions, for instance of overlapping images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Alloy Mixtures and Barycentric Coordinates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For linear systems, the orthonormality of basis representations is one of the most powerful features for system analysis in terms of superposition of normal modes. Neural networks, on the other hand, are intrinsically nonlinear decision systems for which linear superposition does not hold inside the network, even if the symbols presented to the network are orthonormal superpositions. This loss of orthonormality in deep networks can be partially retrieved by selecting the Simplex code. It has pseudo-orthogonal probability distribution functions located on the vertices of the simplex. There is an additional advantage to using the Simplex code: by using so-called barycentric coordinates, the simplex vertices can be expressed as independent bases. An example for the 2-simplex is shown in Fig. 5. The x-y Cartesian coordinates of the vertices (using tensor index notation) are given by (S11, S12), (S21, S22), and (S31, S32). Any point (x1, x2) on the plane can be expressed as a linear combination of the three vertices with barycentric coordinates (v1, v2, v3) by solving for these three coefficients from the equation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;using Cramers rule. For instance, the three vertices of the simplex are expressed using the 3-component barycentric coordinates (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1). The mid-points on the edges have barycentric coordinates (1/2,1/2,0), (0,1/2,1/2), and (1/2,0,1/2). The centroid of the simplex has barycentric coordinates (1/3,1/3,1/3). Barycentric coordinates on a simplex are commonly used in phase diagrams of alloy systems in materials science. The simplex can also be used to identify crystallographic directions in three-dimensions, as in Fig. 6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Replicator Dynamics on the Simplex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ecosystems are among the most complex systems on Earth. The complex interactions among hundreds or thousands of species may lead to steady homeostasis in some cases, to growth and collapse in other cases, and to oscillations or chaos in yet others. But the definition of species can be broad and abstract, referring to businesses and markets in economic ecosystems, or to cliches and acquaintances in social ecosystems, among many other examples. These systems are governed by the laws of evolutionary dynamics that include fitness and survival as well as adaptation. The dimensionality of the dynamical spaces for these systems extends to hundreds or thousands of dimensions—far too complex to visualize when thinking in four dimensions is already challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A classic model of interacting species is the replicator equation. It allows for a fitness-based proliferation and for trade-offs among the individual species. The replicator dynamics equations are shown in Fig. 7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The population dynamics on the 2D simplex are shown in Fig. 8 for several different pay-off matrices (square matrix to the upper left of each simplex). The matrix values are shown in color and help interpret the trajectories. For instance the simplex on the upper-right shows a fixed point center. This reflects the antisymmetric character of the pay-off matrix around the diagonal. The stable spiral on the lower-left has a nearly asymmetric pay-off matrix, but with unequal off-diagonal magnitudes. The other two cases show central saddle points with stable fixed points on the boundary. A large variety of behaviors are possible for this very simple system. The Python program can be found in Trirep.py.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linear Programming with the Dantzig Simplex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a large set of optimization problems in which a linear objective function is to be minimized subject to a set of inequalities. This is known as “Linear Programming”. These LP systems can be expressed as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vector index goes from 1 to d, the dimension of the space. Each inequality creates a hyperplane, where two such hyperplanes intersect along a line terminated at each end by a vertex point. The set of vertexes defines a polytope in d-dimensions, and each face of the polytope, when combined with the point at the origin, defines a 3-simplex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is easy to visualize in lower dimensions why the linear objective function must have an absolute minimum at one of the vertexes of the polytope. And finding that minimum is a trivial exercise: Start at any vertex. Poll each neighboring vertex and move to the one that has the lowest value of the objective function. Repeat until the current vertex has a lower objective value than any neighbors. Because of the linearity of the objective function, this is a unique minimum (except for rare cases of accidental degeneracy). This iterative algorithm defines a walk on the vertexes of the polytope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question arises, why not just evaluate the objection function at each vertex and then just pick the vertex with the lowest value? The answer in high dimensions is that there are too many vertexes, and finding all of them is inefficient. If there are N vertexes, the walk to the solution visits only a few of the vertexes, on the order of log(N). The algorithm therefore scales as log(N), just like a search tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This simple algorithm was devised by George Dantzig (1914 – 2005) in 1939 when he was a graduate student at UC Berkeley. He had arrived late to class and saw two problems written on the chalk board. He assumed that these were homework assignments, so he wrote them down and worked on them over the following week. He recalled that they seemed a bit harder than usual, but he eventually solved them and turned them in. A few weeks later, his very excited professor approached him and told him that the problems weren’t homework–they were two of the most important outstanding problems in optimization and that Dantzig had just solved them! The 1997 movie Good Will Hunting, with Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Robin Williams, borrowed this story for the opening scene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Amoeba Simplex Crawling through Hyperspace&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike linear programming problems with linear objective functions, multidimensional minimization of nonlinear objective functions is an art unto itself, with many approach. One of these is a visually compelling algorithm that does the trick more often than not. This is the so-called amoeba algorithm that shares much in common with the Dantzig simplex approach to linear programming, but instead of a set of fixed simplex coordinates, it uses a constantly shifting d-dimensional simplex that “crawls” over the objective function, seeking its minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the best descriptions of the amoeba simplex algorithm is in “Numerical Recipes” [4] that describes the crawling simplex as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it reaches a “valley floor”, the method contracts itself in the transverse direction and tries to ooze down the valley. If there is a situation where the simplex is trying to “pass through the eye of a needle”, it contracts itself in all directions, pulling itself in around its lowest (best) point.&lt;/p&gt;(From Press, Numerical Recipes, Cambridge)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic operations for the crawling simplex are reflection and scaling. For a given evaluation of all the vertexes of the simplex, one will have the highest value and another the lowest. In a reflection, the highest point is reflected through the d-dimensional face defined by the other d vertexes. After reflection, if the new evaluation is lower than the former lowest value, then the point is expanded. If, on the other hand, it is little better than it was before reflection, then the point is contracted. The expansion and contraction are what allows the algorithm to slide through valleys or shrink to pass through the eye of a needle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amoeba algorithm was developed by John Nelder and Roger Mead in 1965 at a time when computing power was very limited. The algorithm works great as a first pass at a minimization problem, and it almost always works for moderately small dimensions, but for very high dimensions there are more powerful algorithms today for optimization, built into all the deep learning software environments like Tensor Flow and the Matlab toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Reduce time to treatment by over 90%&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Improve prior authorization approval and reimbursement rates&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Leverage structured data to enhance drug program performance and clinical decision-making&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Administrative costs account for over 20% of U.S. healthcare spending—delaying care, draining revenue, and driving staff burnout while having less visibility into patient care than ever before. We built Trellis to tackle this head on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 170 Starshield satellites built by SpaceX for the US government’s National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) have been sending signals in the wrong direction, a satellite researcher found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SpaceX-built spy satellites are helping the NRO greatly expand its satellite surveillance capabilities, but the purpose of these signals is unknown. The signals are sent from space to Earth in a frequency band that’s allocated internationally for Earth-to-space and space-to-space transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been no public complaints of interference caused by the surprising Starshield emissions. But the researcher who found them says they highlight a troubling lack of transparency in how the US government manages the use of spectrum and a failure to coordinate spectrum usage with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scott Tilley, an engineering technologist and amateur radio astronomer in British Columbia, discovered the signals in late September or early October while working on another project. He found them in various parts of the 2025–2110 MHz band, and from his location, he was able to confirm that 170 satellites were emitting the signals over Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Given the global nature of the Starshield constellation, the signals may be emitted over other countries as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This particular band is allocated by the ITU [International Telecommunication Union], the United States, and Canada primarily as an uplink band to spacecraft on orbit—in other words, things in space, so satellite receivers will be listening on these frequencies,” Tilley told Ars. “If you’ve got a loud constellation of signals blasting away on the same frequencies, it has the potential to interfere with the reception of ground station signals being directed at satellites on orbit.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the US, users of the 2025–2110 MHz portion of the S-Band include NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as nongovernmental users like TV news broadcasters that have vehicles equipped with satellite dishes to broadcast from remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;
