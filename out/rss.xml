  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re introducing GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, our new frontier agentic coding model, available in Codex today. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is built on an update to our foundational reasoning model, which is trained on agentic tasks across software engineering, math, research, and more. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is faster, more intelligent, and more token-efficient at every stage of the development cycle–and a new step towards becoming a reliable coding partner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is built for long-running, detailed work. It’s our first model natively trained to operate across multiple context windows through a process called compaction, coherently working over millions of tokens in a single task. This unlocks project-scale refactors, deep debugging sessions, and multi-hour agent loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is available in Codex today for use in the CLI, IDE extension, cloud, and code review, and API access is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max was trained on real-world software engineering tasks, like PR creation, code review, frontend coding, and Q&amp;amp;A and outperforms our previous models on many frontier coding evaluations. The model’s gains on benchmarks also come with improvements to real-world usage: GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is the first model we have trained to operate in Windows environments, and the model’s training now includes tasks designed to make it a better collaborator in the Codex CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max shows significant improvements in token efficiency due to more effective reasoning. On SWE-bench Verified, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max with ‘medium’ reasoning effort achieves better performance than GPT‑5.1-Codex with the same reasoning effort, while using 30% fewer thinking tokens. For non-latency-sensitive tasks, we’re also introducing a new Extra High (‘xhigh’) reasoning effort, which thinks for an even longer period of time for a better answer. We still recommend medium as the daily driver for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expect the token efficiency improvements to translate to real-world savings for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is able to produce high quality frontend designs with similar functionality and aesthetics, but at much lower cost than GPT‑5.1-Codex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Prompt:&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;code&gt; Generate a single self-contained browser app that renders an interactive CartPole RL sandbox with canvas graphics, a tiny policy-gradient controller, metrics, and an SVG network visualizer.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Features&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Must be able to actually train a policy to make model better at cart pole&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Visualizer for the activations/weights when the model is training or at inference&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Steps in the episode, rewards this episode&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Last survival time and best survival time in steps&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Save to index.html&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compaction enables GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max to complete tasks that would have previously failed due to context-window limits, such as complex refactors and long-running agent loops by pruning its history while preserving the most important context over long horizons. In Codex applications, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max automatically compacts its session when it approaches its context window limit, giving it a fresh context window. It repeats this process until the task is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability to sustain coherent work over long horizons is a foundational capability on the path toward more general, reliable AI systems. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max can work independently for hours at a time. In our internal evaluations, we’ve observed GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max work on tasks for more than 24 hours. It will persistently iterate on its implementation, fix test failures, and ultimately deliver a successful result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max performs significantly better on evaluations that require sustained, long-horizon reasoning. Because it can coherently work across multiple context windows using compaction, the model delivers improved results on challenges in areas like long-horizon coding and cybersecurity. We analyzed the results of this model’s performance on first- and third-party evaluations in the GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max system card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max does not reach High capability on Cybersecurity under our Preparedness Framework but it is the most capable cybersecurity model we’ve deployed to date and agentic cybersecurity capabilities are rapidly evolving. As a result, we are taking steps to prepare for High capability on Cybersecurity and are enhancing our safeguards in the cyber domain and working to ensure that defenders can benefit from these improved capabilities through programs like Aardvark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we launched GPT‑5-Codex, we implemented dedicated cybersecurity-specific monitoring to detect and disrupt malicious activity. While we have not observed a meaningful increase in scaled abuse, we are preparing additional mitigations for advanced capabilities. Our teams have already disrupted cyber operations attempting to misuse our models, and suspicious activity is routed for review through our policy monitoring systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is designed to run in a secure sandbox by default: file writes are limited to its workspace, and network access is disabled unless a developer turns it on. We recommend keeping Codex in this restricted-access mode, since enabling internet or web search can introduce prompt-injection risks from untrusted content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Codex becomes more capable of long-running tasks, it is increasingly important for developers to review the agent’s work before making changes or deploying to production. To assist with this, Codex produces terminal logs and cites its tool calls and test results. While its code reviews reduce the risk of deploying model or human produced bugs to production, Codex should be treated as an additional reviewer and not a replacement for human reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity capabilities can be used for both defense and offense, so we take an iterative deployment approach: learning from real-world use, updating safeguards, and preserving important defensive tools such as automated vulnerability scanning and remediation assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is available in Codex with ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans. For details on how usage limits work for your plan, please see our docs(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For developers using Codex CLI via API key, we plan to make GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max available in the API soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting today, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max will replace GPT‑5.1-Codex as the default model in Codex surfaces. Unlike GPT‑5.1, which is a general-purpose model, we recommend using GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max and the Codex family of models only for agentic coding tasks in Codex or Codex-like environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max shows how far models have come in sustaining long-horizon coding tasks, managing complex workflows, and producing high-quality implementations with far fewer tokens. We’ve seen the model combined with steady upgrades to our CLI, IDE extension, cloud integration, and code review tooling result in supercharged engineering productivity: internally, 95% of OpenAI engineers use Codex weekly, and these engineers ship roughly 70% more pull requests since adopting Codex. As we push the frontier of what agents are able to do, we’re excited to see what you'll build with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The lost cause of the Lisp machines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am just really bored by Lisp Machine romantics at this point: they should go away. I expect they never will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;History&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Symbolics went bankrupt in early 1993. In the way of these things various remnants of the company lingered on for, in this case, decades. But 1983 was when the Lisp Machines died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The death was not unexpected: by the time I started using mainstream Lisps in 19891 everyone knew that special hardware for Lisp was a dead idea. The common idea was that the arrival of RISC machines had killed it, but in fact machines like the Sun 3/260 in its ‘AI’ configuration2 were already hammering nails in its coffin. In 1987 I read a report showing the Lisp performance of an early RISC machine, using Kyoto Common Lisp, not a famously fast implementation of CL, beating a Symbolics on the Gabriel benchmarks [PDF link].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1993 is 32 years ago. The Symbolics 3600, probably the first Lisp machine that sold in more than tiny numbers, was introduced in 1983, ten years earlier. People who used Lisp machines other than as historical artefacts are old today3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisp machines were both widely available and offered the best performance for Lisp for a period of about five years which ended nearly forty years ago. They were probably never competitive in terms of performance for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is time, and long past time, to let them go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But still the romantics — some of them even old enough to remember the Lisp machines — repeat their myths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘It was the development environment’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The development environments offered by both families of Lisp machines were seriously cool, at least for the 1980s. I mean, they really were very cool indeed. Some of the ways they were cool matter today, but some don’t. For instance in the 1980s and early 1990s Lisp images were very large compared to available memory, and machines were also extremely slow in general. So good Lisp development environents did a lot of work to hide this slowness, and in general making sure you only very seldom had to restart everthing, which took significant fractions of an hour, if not more. None of that matters today, because machines are so quick and Lisps so relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that’s not the only way they were cool. They really were just lovely things to use in many ways. But, despite what people might believe: this did not depend on the hardware: there is no reason at all why a development environent that cool could not be built on stock hardware. Perhaps, (perhaps) that was not true in 1990: it is certainly true today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if a really cool Lisp development environment doesn’t exist today, it is nothing to do with Lisp machines not existing. In fact, as someone who used Lisp machines, I find the LispWorks development environment at least as comfortable and productive as they were. But, oh no, the full-fat version is not free, and no version is open source. Neither, I remind you, were they.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘They were much faster than anything else’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, they weren’t. Please, stop with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘The hardware was user-microcodable, you see’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please, stop telling me things about machines I used: believe it or not, I know those things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many machines were user-microcodable before about 1990. That meant that, technically, a user of the machine could implement their own instruction set. I am sure there are cases where people even did that, and a much smaller number of cases where doing that was not just a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in almost all cases the only people who wrote microcode were the people who built the machine. And the reason they wrote microcode was because it is the easiest way of implementing a very complex instruction set, especially when you can’t use vast numbers of transistors. For instance if you’re going to provide an ‘add’ instruction which will add numbers of any type, trapping back into user code for some cases, then by far the easiest way of doing that is going to be by writing code, not building hardware. And that’s what the Lisp machines did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the compiler could have generated that code for hardware without that instruction. But with the special instruction the compiler’s job is much easier, and code is smaller. A small, quick compiler and small compiled code were very important with slow machines which had tiny amounts of memory. Of course a compiler not made of wet string could have used type information to avoid generating the full dispatch case, but wet string was all that was available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What microcodable machines almost never meant was that users of the machines would write microcode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, the tradeoffs made by Lisp machines might even have been reasonable. CISC machines in general were probably good compromises given the expense of memory and how rudimentary compilers were: I can remember being horrified at the size of compiled code for RISC machines. But I was horrified because I wasn’t thinking about it properly. Moore’s law was very much in effect in about 1990 and, among other things, it meant that the amount of memory you could afford was rising exponentially with time: the RISC people understood that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘They were Lisp all the way down’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This, finally, maybe, is a good point. They were, and you could dig around and change things on the fly, and this was pretty cool. Sometimes you could even replicate the things you’d done later. I remember playing with sound on a 3645 which was really only possible because you could get low-level access to the disk from Lisp, as the disk could just marginally provide data fast enough to stream sound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand they had no isolation and thus no security at all: people didn’t care about that in 1985, but if I was using a Lisp-based machine today I would certainly be unhappy if my web browser could modify my device drivers on the fly, or poke and peek at network buffers. A machine that was Lisp all the way down today would need to ensure that things like that couldn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So may be it would be Lisp all the way down, but you absolutely would not have the kind of ability to poke around in and redefine parts of the guts you had on Lisp machines. Maybe that’s still worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not to mention that I’m just not very interested in spending a huge amount of time grovelling around in the guts of something like an SSL implementation: those things exist already, and I’d rather do something new and cool. I’d rather do something that Lisp is uniquely suited for, not reinvent wheels. Well, may be that’s just me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Machines which were Lisp all the way down might, indeed, be interesting, although they could not look like 1980s Lisp machines if they were to be safe. But that does not mean they would need special hardware for Lisp: they wouldn’t. If you want something like this, hardware is not holding you back: there’s no need to endlessly mourn the lost age of Lisp machines, you can start making one now. Shut up and code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now we come to the really strange arguments, the arguments that we need special Lisp machines either for reasons which turn out to be straightforwardly false, or because we need something that Lisp machines never were.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘Good Lisp compilers are too hard to write for stock hardware’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This mantra is getting old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important thing is that we have good stock-hardware Lisp compilers today. As an example, today’s CL compilers are not far from CLANG/LLVM for floating-point code. I tested SBCL and LispWorks: it would be interesting to know how many times more work has gone into LLVM than them for such a relatively small improvement. I can’t imagine a world where these two CL compilers would not be at least comparable to LLVM if similar effort was spent on them4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These things are so much better than the wet-cardboard-and-string compilers that the LispMs had it’s not funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A large amount of work is also going into compilation for other dynamically-typed, interactive languages which aim at high performance. That means on-the-fly compilation and recompilation of code where both the compilation and the resulting code must be quick. Example: Julia. Any of that development could be reused by Lisp compiler writers if they needed to or wanted to (I don’t know if they do, or should).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, but then it turns out that that’s not what is meant by a ‘good compiler’ after all. It turns out that ‘good’ means ‘compillation is fast’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All these compilers are pretty quick: the computational resources used by even a pretty hairy compiler have not scaled anything like as fast as those needed for the problems we want to solve (that’s why Julia can use LLVM on the fly). Compilation is also not an Amdahl bottleneck as it can happen on the node that needs the compiled code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compilers are so quick that a widely-used CL implementation exists where EVAL uses the compiler, unless you ask it not to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compilation options are also a thing: you can ask compilers to be quick, fussy, sloppy, safe, produce fast code and so on. Some radically modern languages also allow this to be done in a standardised (but extensible) way at the language level, so you can say ‘make this inner loop really quick, and I have checked all the bounds so don’t bother with that’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tradeoff between a fast Lisp compiler and a really good Lisp compiler is imaginary, at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘They had wonderful keyboards’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, if you didn’t mind the weird layouts: yes, they did5. And has exactly nothing to do with Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so it goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bored now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a well-known syndrome amongst photographers and musicians called GAS: gear acquisition syndrome. Sufferers from this6 pursue an endless stream of purchases of gear — cameras, guitars, FX pedals, the last long-expired batch of a legendary printing paper — in the strange hope that the next camera, the next pedal, that paper, will bring out the Don McCullin, Jimmy Page or Chris Killip in them. Because, of course, Don McCullin &amp;amp; Chris Killip only took the pictures they did because he had the right cameras: it was nothing to do with talent, practice or courage, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GAS is a lie we tell ourselves to avoid the awkward reality that what we actually need to do is practice, a lot, and that even if we did that we might not actually be very talented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisp machine romanticism is the same thing: a wall we build ourself so that, somehow unable to climb over it or knock it down, we never have to face the fact that the only thing stopping us is us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no purpose to arguing with Lisp machine romantics because they will never accept that the person building the endless barriers in their way is the same person they see in the mirror every morning. They’re too busy building the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a footnote, I went to a talk by an HPC person in the early 90s (so: after the end of the cold war7 and when the HPC money had gone) where they said that HPC people needed to be aiming at machines based on what big commercial systems looked like as nobody was going to fund dedicated HPC designs any more. At the time that meant big cache-coherent SMP systems. Those hit their limits and have really died out now: the bank I worked for had dozens of fully-populated big SMP systems in 2007, it perhaps still has one or two they can’t get rid of because of some legacy application. So HPC people now run on enormous shared-nothing farms of close-to-commodity processors with very fat interconnect and are wondering about / using GPUs. That’s similar to what happened to Lisp systems, of course: perhaps, in the HPC world, there are romantics who mourn the lost glories of the Cray–3. Well, if I was giving a talk to people interested in the possibilities of hardware today I’d be saying that in a few years there are going to be a lot of huge farms of GPUs going very cheap if you can afford the power. People could be looking at whether those can be used for anything more interesting than the huge neural networks they were designed for. I don’t know if they can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before that I had read about Common Lisp but actually written programs in Cambridge Lisp and Standard Lisp. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This had a lot of memory and a higher-resolution screen, I think, and probably was bundled with a rebadged Lucid Common Lisp. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I am at the younger end of people who used these machines in anger: I was not there for the early part of the history described here, and I was also not in the right part of the world at a time when that mattered more. But I wrote Lisp from about 1985 and used Lisp machines of both families from 1989 until the mid to late 1990s. I know from first-hand experience what these machines were like. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If anyone has good knowledge of Arm64 (specifically Apple M1) assembler and performance, and the patience to pore over a couple of assembler listings and work out performance differences, please get in touch. I have written most of a document exploring the difference in performance, but I lost the will to live at the point where it came down to understanding just what details made the LLVM code faster. All the compilers seem to do a good job of the actual float code, but perhaps things like array access or loop overhead are a little slower in Lisp. The difference between SBCL &amp;amp; LLVM is a factor of under 1.2. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Sun type 3 keyboard was both wonderful and did not have a weird layout, so there’s that. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I am one: I know what I’m talking about here. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The cold war did not end in 1991. America did not win. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Blackouts led to loss of steering and propulsion on 984-foot-long vessel&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Nov. 18, 2025) -- The NTSB said Tuesday that a single loose wire on the 984-foot-long containership Dali caused an electrical blackout that led to the giant vessel veering and contacting the nearby Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which then collapsed, killing six highway workers. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At Tuesday’s public meeting at NTSB headquarters, investigators said the loose wire in the ship’s electrical system caused a breaker to unexpectedly open -- beginning a sequence of events that led to two vessel blackouts and a loss of both propulsion and steering near the 2.37-mile-long Key Bridge on March 26, 2024. Investigators found that wire-label banding prevented the wire from being fully inserted into a terminal block spring-clamp gate, causing an inadequate connection. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p/&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;After the initial blackout, the Dali’s heading began swinging to starboard toward Pier 17 of the Key Bridge. Investigators found that the pilots and the bridge team attempted to change the vessel’s trajectory, but the loss of propulsion so close to the bridge rendered their actions ineffective. A substantial portion of the bridge subsequently collapsed into the river, and portions of the pier, deck and truss spans collapsed onto the vessel’s bow and forwardmost container bays. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A seven-person road maintenance crew and one inspector were on the bridge when the vessel struck. Six of the highway workers died. The NTSB found that the quick actions of the Dali pilots, shoreside dispatchers and the Maryland Transportation Authority to stop bridge traffic prevented greater loss of life. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;”Our investigators routinely accomplish the impossible, and this investigation is no different,’ said NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy. “The Dali, at almost 1,000 feet, is as long as the Eiffel Tower is high, with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Finding this single wire was like hunting for a loose rivet on the Eiffel Tower. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“But like all of the accidents we investigate,this was preventable,” Homendy said. “Implementing NTSB recommendations in this investigation will prevent similar tragedies in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Contributing to the collapse of the Key Bridge and the loss of life was the lack of countermeasures to reduce the bridge’s vulnerability to collapse due to impact by ocean-going vessels, which have only grown larger since the Key Bridge’s opening in 1977. When the Japan-flagged containership Blue Nagoya contacted the Key Bridge after losing propulsion in 1980, the 390-foot-long vessel caused only minor damage. The Dali, however, is 10 times the size of the Blue Nagoya. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As part of the investigation, the NTSB in March released an initial report on the vulnerability of bridges nationwide to large vessel strikes. The report found that the Maryland Transportation Authority—and many other owners of bridges spanning navigable waterways used by ocean-going vessels—were likely unaware of the potential risk that a vessel collision could pose to their structures. This was despite longstanding guidance from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommending that bridge owners perform these assessments. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The NTSB sent letters to 30 bridge owners identified in the report, urging them to evaluate their bridges and, if needed, develop plans to reduce risks. All recipients have since responded, and the status of each recommendation is available on the NTSB’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; As a result of the investigation, the NTSB issued new safety recommendations to the US Coast Guard; US Federal Highway Administration; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK); the American National Standards Institute; the American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee on Safety in Construction and Demolitions Operations A10; HD Hyundai Heavy Industries; Synergy Marine Pte. Ltd; and WAGO Corporation, the electrical component manufacturer; and multiple bridge owners across the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A synopsis of actions taken Tuesday, including the probable cause, findings and recommendations, can be found on ntsb.gov. The complete investigation report will be released in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To report an incident/accident or if you are a public safety agency, please call 1-844-373-9922 or 202-314-6290 to speak to a Watch Officer at the NTSB Response Operations Center (ROC) in Washington, DC (24/7).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;IT-Security Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research identified and responsibly disclosed a large-scale privacy weakness in WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism that allowed the enumeration of 3.5 billion accounts. In collaboration with the researchers, Meta has since addressed and mitigated the issue. The study underscores the importance of continuous, independent security research on widely used communication platforms and highlights the risks associated with the centralization of instant messaging services. The preprint of the study has now been published, and the results will be presented in 2026 at the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism can use a user's address book to find other WhatsApp users by their phone number. Using the same underlying mechanism, the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to query more than 100 million phone numbers per hour through WhatsApp's infrastructure, confirming more than 3.5 billion active accounts across 245 countries. "Normally, a system shouldn't respond to such a high number of requests in such a short time — particularly when originating from a single source," explains lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna. "This behavior exposed the underlying flaw, which allowed us to issue an effectively unlimited requests to the server and, in doing so, map user data worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The accessible data items used in the study are the same that are public for anyone who knows a user's phone number and consist of: phone number, public keys, timestamps, and, if set to public, about text and profile picture. From these data points, the researchers were able to extract additional information, which allowed them to infer a user's operating system, account age, as well as the number of linked companion devices. The study shows that even this limited amount of data per user can reveal important information, both on macroscopic and individual levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The study also revealed a range of broader insights:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Millions of active WhatsApp accounts were identified in countries where the platform was officially banned, including China, Iran, and Myanmar.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Population-level insights into platform usage, such as the global distribution of Android (81%) versus iOS (19%) devices, regional differences in privacy behavior (e.g., use of public profile pictures or "about" tagline), and variations in user growth across countries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A small number of cases showed re-use of cryptographic keys across different devices or phone numbers, pointing to potential weaknesses in non-official WhatsApp clients or fraudulent use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nearly half of all phone numbers that appeared in the 2021 Facebook data leak of 500 million phone numbers (caused by a scraping incident in 2018) were still active on WhatsApp. This highlights the enduring risks for leaked numbers (e.g., being targeted in scam calls) associated with such exposures.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study did not involve access to message content, and no personal data was published or shared. All retrieved data was deleted by the researchers prior to publication. Message content on WhatsApp is “end-to-end encrypted” and was not affected at any time. “This end-to-end encryption protects the content of messages, but not necessarily the associated metadata,” explains last author Aljosha Judmayer from the University of Vienna. “Our work shows that privacy risks can also arise when such metadata is collected and analysed on a large scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These findings remind us that even mature, widely trusted systems can contain design or implementation flaws that have real-world consequences," says lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna: "They show that security and privacy are not one-time achievements, but must be continuously re-evaluated as technology evolves."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Building on our previous findings on delivery receipts and key management, we are contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve and where new risks arise," adds co-author Maximilian Günther from the University of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are grateful to the University of Vienna researchers for their responsible partnership and diligence under our Bug Bounty program. This collaboration successfully identified a novel enumeration technique that surpassed our intended limits, allowing the researchers to scrape basic publicly available information. We had already been working on industry-leading anti-scraping systems, and this study was instrumental in stress-testing and confirming the immediate efficacy of these new defenses. Importantly, the researchers have securely deleted the data collected as part of the study, and we have found no evidence of malicious actors abusing this vector. As a reminder, user messages remained private and secure thanks to WhatsApp’s default end-to-end encryption, and no non-public data was accessible to the researchers”, says Nitin Gupta, Vice President of Engineering at WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ethical Handling and Disclosure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research was conducted with strict ethical guidelines and in accordance with responsible disclosure principles. The findings were promptly reported to Meta, the operator of WhatsApp, which has since implemented countermeasures (e.g., rate-limiting, stricter profile information visibility) to close the identified vulnerability. The authors argue that transparency, academic scrutiny, and independent testing are essential to maintaining trust in global communication services. They emphasize that proactive collaboration between researchers and industry can significantly improve user privacy and prevent abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Research Context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This publication represents the third study by researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research examining the security and privacy of prevalent instant messengers such as WhatsApp and Signal. The team investigates how design and implementation choices in end-to-end encrypted messaging services can unintentionally expose user information or weaken privacy guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the researchers published "Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile Instant Messengers" (distinguished with the Best Paper Award at RAID 2025), which demonstrated how silent pings and their delivery receipts could be abused to infer user activity patterns and online behavior on WhatsApp and similar messaging platforms. Later that same year, "Prekey Pogo: Investigating Security and Privacy Issues in WhatsApp's Handshake Mechanism" (presented at USENIX WOOT 2025) analyzed the cryptographic foundations of WhatsApp's prekey distribution mechanism, revealing implementation weaknesses of the Signal-based protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"By building on our earlier findings about delivery receipts and key management, we're contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve, and where new risks emerge." said Maximilian Günther (University of Vienna).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current study, "Hey there! You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy", extends this line of research to the global scope, showing how contact discovery mechanisms can unintentionally allow large-scale user enumeration at an unprecedented magnitude. It will appear in the proceedings of the NDSS Symposium 2026, one of the leading international conferences on computer and network security.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[TOC]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The survival of our species owes much to our brain, specifically, its ability to observe, analyse, and plan. Planting crops and storing grains for the winter were some of the earliest uses of these abilities. Measuring and calculating are foundational elements of observation, analysis, and planning. Computation, upon which our modern society depends, is but an extension of those ancient measurement and calculation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calculations operate on operands obtained through measurements. Counting was the oldest form of measurement. In prehistory, humans counted by scratching marks on bones. Next to evolve was a ruler etched with markings. Thereafter, humans were marking, measuring, calculating, tracking, and predicting the movements of the Sun and the Moon using stone pillars, astronomically aligned burial mounds, and sun dials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By around 3000 BC, Sumerians invented the sexagesimal (base-$60$) number system, and they were using the abacus by 2700 BC. The abacus was one of the earliest devices that mechanised calculations, and it is still in extensive use, throughout the world. A cuneiform clay tablet from 1800 BC shows that Babylonians already knew how to survey land boundaries with the aid of Pythagorean triples. Egyptians improved upon these techniques to survey property boundaries on the Nile flood planes and to erect the pyramids. By 220 BC, Persian astronomers were using the astrolabe to calculate the latitude, to measure the height of objects, and to triangulate positions. Greeks constructed truly advanced mechanical instruments that predicted solar and lunar eclipses. The sophistication and refinement exhibited by the Antikythera mechanism from around 200 BC continues to amaze modern engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ancient astronomy measured, tracked, and predicted the movements of heavenly objects. But when celestial navigation came to be used extensively in global trade across the oceans, we began charting the night sky in earnest, and thus was born modern astronomy. Astronomical calculations involved manually manipulating numbers. Those calculations were tedious and error prone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1614, a brilliant Scottish mathematician John Napier discovered logarithms. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say Napier invented logarithms, for his discovery was motivated by his desire to simplify multiplication and division. Arithmetically, multiplication can be expressed as repeated additions, and division as repeated subtractions. Logarithmically, multiplication of two numbers can be reduced to addition of their logarithms, and division to subtraction thereof. Hence, multiplication and division of very large numbers can be reduced to straightforward addition and subtraction, with the aid of prepared logarithm and inverse logarithm tables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1620, Edmund Gunter, an English astronomer, used Napier’s logarithms to fashion a calculating device that came to be known as Gunter’s scale. The markings on this device were not linear like a simple ruler, but logarithmic. To multiply two numbers, the length representing the multiplicand is first marked out on the logarithmic scale using a divider and, from thence, the length representing the multiplier is similarly marked out, thereby obtaining the product, which is the sum of the two logarithmic lengths. Gunter’s scale mechanised the tedious task of looking up numbers on logarithm tables. This device was the forerunner of the slide rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first practical slide rule was invented by William Oughtred, an English mathematician, in 1622. Oughtred used two bits of wood graduated with Gunter’s scale to perform multiplication and addition. Then, in 1630, Oughtred fashioned a brass circular slide rule with two integrated pointers. This device was a significant improvement over Gunter’s scale, in terms of practicality and usability. The photograph below shows a brass circular slide rule that is a contemporaneous clone of Oughtred’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The earliest adopters of the slide rule were the 17th century astronomers, who used it to perform arithmetic and trigonometric operations, quickly. But it was the 19th century engineers, the spearheads of the Industrial Revolution, who propelled the slide rule technology forward. For nearly four centuries after its invention, the slide rule remained the preeminent calculating device. Buildings, bridges, machines, and even computer system components, were designed by slide rule. Apollo astronauts carried the Pickett N600-ES pocket slide rule, onboard, for navigation and propulsion calculations. The General Dynamics F-16, a modern, air-superiority fighter, was designed by slide rule. Well into the late 1970s, school children all over the world, including me, were taught to use the slide rule and the logarithm book, along with penmanship and grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The largest and most enthusiastic group of slide rule users, naturally, were engineers. But slide rules were used in all areas of human endeavour that required calculation: business, construction, manufacturing, medicine, photography, and more. Obviously, bankers and accountants relied on the slide rule to perform sundry arithmetic gymnastics. Construction sites and factory floors, too, used specialised versions of slide rules for mixing concrete, computing volumes, etc. Surveyors used the stadia slide rule made specifically for them. Doctors use special, medical slide rules for calculating all manner of things: body mass index, pregnancy terms, medicine dosage, and the like. Photographers used photometric slide rules for calculating film development times. Army officers used artillery slide rules to compute firing solutions in the field. Pilots used aviation slide rules for navigation and fuel-burn calculations. The list was long. This humble device elevated the 18th century astronomy, powered the 19th century Industrial Revolution, and seeded the 20th century Technological Revolution. Indeed, the slide rule perfectly expressed the engineering design philosophy: capability through simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then, in 1972, HP released its first programmable scientific calculator, the inimitable HP-35. The HP-35 rang loud the death knell of the slide rule. Although electronic pocket calculators were unaffordable in the early 1970s, they became ubiquitous within a decade thanks to Moore’s law and Dennard’s law, and quickly displaced the slide rule. By the early 1980s, only a few people in the world were using the slide rule. I was one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was around this time that I arrived at the university—in Burma. In those days, electronic pocket calculators were beyond the reach of most Burmese college students. To ensure fairness, my engineering college insisted that all students used the government-issued slide rule, which was readily accessible to everyone. Many classrooms in my college had large, wall-mounted demonstration slide rules to teach first-year students how properly to use the slide rule like an engineer—that is, to eradicate the bad habits learned in high school. As engineering students, we carried the slide rule upon our person, daily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I subsequently emigrated to the US. Arrival in the US ended my association with the slide rule because, by the 1980s, American engineers were already using HP RPN pocket calculators and MATLAB technical computing software on the IBM PC. I soon became an HP calculator devotee. As such, I never got to use the slide rule extensively in a professional setting. But I hung on to my student slide rules: the government-issued Aristo 0968 Studio, a straight rule, and the handed-down Faber-Castell 8/10, a circular rule. To this day, I remain partial to the intimate, tactile nature of the slide rule, especially the demands it places upon the user’s mind. Over the next four decades, I collected many slide rules, dribs and drabs. The models in my collection are the ones I admired as an engineering student in Burma, but were, then, beyond reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In its heyday, everyone used the slide rule in every facet of life. As children, we saw it being used everywhere, so we were acquainted with it, even if we did not know how to use it. We were taught to use the slide rule’s basic facilities in middle school. Our options were the abacus, the log books, or the slide rule. The choice was abundantly clear: we enthusiastically took up the slide rule—a rite of passage, as it were. Now, though, even the brightest engineering students in the world have never heard of a slide rule, let alone know how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main goal in writing this article is to preserve the knowledge about, and the memory of, this ingenious computing device: how it works and how it was used. The focus here is on the basic principles of operation and how the slide rule was used in engineering. This is a “how it works” explanation, and not a “how to use” manual. Those who are interested in the most efficient use of a slide rule may read the manuals listed in the resources section at the end of this article. Beyond history and reminiscence, I hope to highlight the wide-ranging utility of some of the most basic mathematical functions that are familiar to middle schoolers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is mighty difficult to discuss the slide rule without having the device in hand. For the presentations below, I chose the Keuffel &amp;amp; Esser (K&amp;amp;E) 4081-3 Log Log Duplex Decitrig, a well-made wood rule. It was one of the most popular engineering slide rules for decades, especially in the US. As such, many engineering professors published good introductory books for it, and these books are now available online in PDF format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term “log-log” refers to the $LL$ scale, which is used to compute exponentiation, as will be explained, later. The term “duplex” refers to the fact that both sides of the frame are engraved with scales, a K&amp;amp;E invention. The label “Decitrig” was K&amp;amp;E’s trade name for its slide rules that used decimal degrees for trigonometric computations, instead of minutes and seconds. Engineers prefer using the more convenient decimal notation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another common model was the Post 1460 Versalog. Although less popular than the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3, the Post 1460 is cheaper and, in my opinion, is a better slide rule. It is made of bamboo, a more stable material than wood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go on eBay and buy a good, inexpensive slide rule, either the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 or the Post 1460; you will need a slide rule to follow the discussions below. Alternatively, you could use a slide rule simulator. The feature of this simulator that is especially useful to novices is the cursor’s ability instantaneously to show the exact scale values under the hairline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I recommend that, after you have read this article, you study one or more of the books listed in the resources section at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A slide rule comprises three components: the body, the slide, and the cursor, as shown below. The body, about 25 cm in length, consists of two pieces of wood, the upper and the lower frames, bound together with metal brackets at the ends. The slide is a thin strip of wood that glides left and right between the upper and the lower frames. The cursor consists of two small plates of glass held by metal brackets and these brackets are anchored to the upper and the lower lintels. The cursor straddles the body and glides across its length. Hence, the three components of a slide rule move independently of, and with respect to, one another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A duplex slide rule, like the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 shown below, both sides of the frame have scales, and so do both sides of the slide. These scales are set and read using the hairline inscribed on the cursor glass. The cursor cannot slip off the body, because it is blocked by the metal brackets at the ends of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simplex slide rule, like the Nestler 23 R shown below, the cursor can slip off the body. The body is a single piece of wood with a trough in the middle separating the upper and the lower frames. Only the frontside of the frame has scales, but the slide has scales on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The slide rule is always operated using both hands, fingers of one hand pushing and those of the other gently opposing. The lower lintel of the cursor glides along the bottom of the lower frame. There is a tension spring between the upper lintel of the cursor and the top of the upper frame. This tension spring braces the lower lintel of the cursor flush against the bottom of the lower frame. To make fine adjustments of the cursor, one uses the thumbs of both hands against the lower lintel of the cursor. It is important to avoid touching the upper lintel, since it does not sit flush against the frame, due to the tension spring. When using the backside of a duplex straight rule, the lower lintel of the cursor has now flipped to the topside, so it had to be fine adjusted using the forefingers. Fine adjustments of the slide are made with the thumb or the forefinger of one hand opposing its counterpart of the other hand. To use the backside scales on a duplex straight rule, the device is flipped bottom-to-top.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplex slide rules have use instructions and a few scientific constants on the back, but duplex slide rules come with plastic inserts that bear such information. But no engineer I knew actually used this on-device information. Procedures for operating an engineering slide rule are complex; we had to study the user’s manual thoroughly and receive hands-on instructions for several weeks before we became proficient enough to be left alone with a slide rule without causing mayhem in the laboratory. And every branch of engineering has its own set of published handbooks in which many formulae and constants can readily be found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;properties of logarithms—The base-$10$ common logarithm function $log(x)$ and its inverse, the power-of-10 function $10^x$, give life to the slide rule. The two main properties of logarithms upon which the slide rule relies are these:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is, to compute $a × b$, we first compute the sum of $log(a)$ and $log(b)$, then compute the $log^{-1}$ of the sum. Likewise, $a ÷ b$ is computed as the $log^{-1}$ of the difference between $log(a)$ and $log(b)$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;logarithmic scale—The slide rule mechanises these calculations by using two identical logarithmic scales, commonly labelled $C$ (on the slide) and $D$ (on the frame). Gunter’s logarithmic scale is derived from a ruler-like linear scale in the following manner. We begin with a 25-cm-long blank strip of wood and mark it up with $10$ equally spaced segments labelled $0, 1, 2, 3, …, 10$, similar to an ordinary ruler, but labelling the ending $10$ as $1$, instead. This first piece of wood has now become the source linear scale. We then line up the second 25-cm long blank strip of wood with the first one, and mark up that second piece of wood with $9$ unequally spaced segments labelled $1, 2, 3, …, 1$, starting with $1$ and, again, ending with $1$. The division marks of the second piece of wood is placed non-linearly in accordance with their $log$ values and by reference to the linear scale:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second scale thus obtained is the non-linear, logarithmic scale. In the figure below, the upper one is the source linear scale and the lower one is the derived logarithmic scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the slide rule, the source linear scale is labelled $L$, and it is called the “logarithm scale”. The derived logarithmic scale is labelled $D$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would like to direct your attention to this potentially confusing terminology. The term “logarithm scale” refers to the linear $L$ scale used for computing the common logarithm function $log(x)$. And the term “logarithmic scale” refers to the non-linear $C$ and $D$ scales used for computing the arithmetic operations $×$ and $÷$. This knotty terminology is unavoidable, given the logarithmic nature of the slide rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The logarithmic scale and the logarithm scale are related by a bijective function $log$:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the plot below, the black curve is $log$ and the red is $log^{-1}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The special name for $log^{-1}$ is power-of-$10$ function $10^x$. The $D$ and the $L$ scales form a transform pair that converts between the logarithmic scale and the arithmetic scale. It turns out that the $log$ function transforms the arithmetic scale’s $×$ and $÷$ operators into the logarithmic scale’s $+$ and $-$ operators, and the $log^{-1}$ function performs the inverse transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plotting the $log$ function on a logarithmic scale produces a sequence of evenly spaced values. Hence, the $L$ scale appears linear, when laid out on the slide rule. Note also that the mere act of reading $x$ on the logarithmic scale implicitly computes $log(x)$; there is no need explicitly to compute $log^{-1}(x)$. Gunter’s logarithmic scale was the groundbreaking idea that made the slide rule work so effectively, efficiently, effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The logarithmic scale has many other uses in STEM beyond the slide rule: the Richter scale used to measure seismic events; the $dB$ decibel scale used to measure sound pressure levels; the spectrogram used to visualise frequency domain signals are just a few examples. These uses exploit the logarithms’ ability to compress a very large range, while preserving relevant details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;computations using logarithmic scales—To compute $2 × 3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above multiplication procedure computes $2 × 3 = 6$, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To put it another way, adding $2$ units of length and $3$ units of length yields $2 + 3 = 5$ units of length on the arithmetic scale of an ordinary rule. But on the logarithmic scale of the slide rule, adding $2$ units of length and $3$ units of length yields $2 × 3 = 6$ units of length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $2 ÷ 3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiplication and division operations start and end with the cursor hairline on the $D$ scale. Skilled users frequently skipped the initial cursor setting when multiplying and the final cursor setting when dividing, opting instead to use the either end of the $C$ scale as the substitute hairline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In slide rule parlance, accuracy refers to how consistently the device operates—that is, how well it was manufactured and how finely it was calibrated. And precision means how many significant figures the user can reliably read off the scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professional-grade slide rules are made exceedingly well, so they are very accurate. Yet, they all allow the user to calibrate the device. Even a well-made slide rule, like the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 can go out of alignment if mistreated, say by exposing it to sun, solvent, or shock (mechanical or thermal). Misaligned slide rule can be recalibrated using the procedure described in the maintenance section, later in this article. And prolonged exposure to moisture and heat can deform a wood rule, like the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3, thereby damaging it, permanently. The accuracy of a warped wood rule can no longer be restored by recalibrating. So, be kind to your slide rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To analyse the precision of the slide rule, we must examine the resolution of the logarithmic scale, first. The $C$ and $D$ scales are logarithmic, so they are nonlinear. The scales start on the left at $log(1) = 0$, which is marked as $1$, and end on the right at $log(10) = 1$, which is also marked as $1$. Indeed, these scales wrap around by multiples of $10$ and, hence, the $1$ mark at both ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As can be seen in the figure below, the distance between two adjacent major divisions on the scale shrinks logarithmically from left to right:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The figure above also shows the three distinct regions on the $D$ scale that have different resolutions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the left end of the $D$ scale, $1.11$, $1.12$, etc., can be read directly from the scale. With practice, one could visually subdivide each minor division into $10$ sub-subdivisions and discern $1.111$ from $1.112$, reliably, precisely. In the photograph below, the cursor hairline is placed on $1.115$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the middle of the $D$ scale, $3.12$, $3.14$, etc., can be read directly from the scale. Indeed, $3.14$ is marked as $\pi$ on $C$ and $D$ scales of all slide rules. With a nominal eyesight, each minor division could be subdivided visually and easily read $3.13$, which is halfway between the $3.12$ and the $3.14$ graduations. The photograph below shows the hairline on $3.13$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the right end of $D$ scale, $9.8$, $8.85$, $9.9$, $9.95$, etc., can be read directly from the scale. With due care, each minor division could be subdivided into two sub-subdivisions and read without undue strain $9.975$, which is halfway between the $9.95$ and the $1$ graduations. See the photograph below. But for those of us with poor eyesights, it is rather difficult to discern $9.98$ from $9.99$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under optimal conditions—calibrated slide rule, nominal eyesight, good lighting, and alert mind—the slide rule can attain four significant figures of precision on the lower end of the $D$ scale and three significant figures on the higher end of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the logarithmic scale cycles, repeatedly. Hence, the scale reading of $314$ can be valued as $…$, $0.0314$, $0.314$, $3.14$, $31.4$, $314.0$, $3140.0$, $…$ and so forth, depending on the context. The decimal point must be located using mental arithmetic. For example, $\pi/8 \approx 3/8 \approx 0.4$, so the result must necessarily be $0.3927$, not $0.03927$, $3.927,$ nor anything else. So, mental arithmetic locates the decimal point thereby getting us within the zone of accuracy, and scale reading yields the constituent digits thus getting us the precision we desire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, the slide rule was used to evaluate complicated expressions involving many chained calculations when they needed to be performed quickly, but when precision was not a paramount concern. When precision is important, however, logarithm tables were used. These tables were laboriously hand-computed to several significant figures. If the desired value fell between two entries in the table, the user is obliged to interpolate the result, manually. While actuaries may have demanded the high precision afforded by the logarithm table, engineers willingly accepted three or four significant figures offered by the slide rule, because the slide rule was accurate enough for engineering use and it was the fastest means then available to perform calculations. In due course, the slide rule became inextricably linked to engineers, like the stethoscope to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be shocking to a modern reader to learn that slide rule wielding engineers accepted low-precision results, considering how precise today’s engineering is, owing to the use of computer-aided design (CAD) and other automation tools. But these high-tech tools came into common use in engineering, only in the 1990s. Before that, we had to perform analysis by hand using calculators, and prior to that with slide rules. In fact, engineering analysis was a tedious affair. For instance, to design a simple truss bridge—the kind prevalent in the 19th century—the structural engineer must compute the tension and compression forces present in each beam, taking into account the dimensions of the beams, the strengths of various materials, expected dynamic loads, projected maximum winds, and many other factors. The analysis of force vectors involves many arithmetic and trigonometric calculations, even for the simplest of structures. The sheer number calculations made it uneconomical to insist upon the higher precisions offered by the logarithm tables. As such, engineers settled for lower precision, and in compensation incorporated ample safety margins. This was one of the reasons why older structures are heftier, stronger, and longer-lasting, compared to their modern counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slide rules came in straight, circular, and cylindrical varieties. Cylindrical rules consist of two concentric cylinders that slide and rotate relative to each other. The key innovation of cylindrical rules was the helical scale that wraps round the cylinder. This coiled scale stretches to an impressive length, despite the relatively small size of the cylinder. Of course, a longer scale yields a greater precision. The cylinder can be rotated to bring the back-facing numbers round to the front.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Circular rules were the first practical slide rules. Their main advantages are compactness and stoutness. A typical model is constructed like a pocket watch and operated like one too, using crowns. The glass-faced, sealed construction protects the device against dust. Some circular models sport a spiral scale, thereby extracting good precision from a compact real estate. But the circular scales oblige the user to rotate the device frequently for proper reading. Expert users of circular rules were good at reading the scales upside-down. On some very small models, the graduation marks get very tight near the centre. In other words, circular rules can be rather fiddly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of all the varieties, straight rules are the easiest and the most convenient to use, because they are relatively small and light, and because the whole scale is visible at once. However, their scale lengths are bounded by the length of the body. So, straight rules are less precise by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most engineers preferred straight rules, because these devices allowed the user to see the whole scales, and they were fast, accurate, and portable enough for routine use. Hence, this article focuses on straight rules. But a few engineers did use circular models, either because these devices were more precise or because they were more compact. In general, engineers did not use cylindrical ones; these devices were too unwieldy and they had only basic arithmetic scales. But accountants, financiers, actuaries, and others who required greater precision swore by cylindrical rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The commonest kind of slide rule was the 25 cm desk model, called the straight rule. The cursor is made of clear plastic or glass, etched with a hairline. The frame and the slide are made of wood, bamboo, aluminium, or plastic. The name “slide rule” derives from the slippy-slidy bits and the ruler-like scales. Straight rules come in four types: Mannheim, Rietz, Darmstadt, and log-log duplex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The less expensive Mannheim and Rietz models were used in high school, and the more sophisticated Darmstadt and log-log duplex models were used in college. There were longer straight rules used by those who required more precision. And there were shorter, pocket-sized straight rules, like the Pickett N600-ES carried by the Apollo astronauts. Although not very precise, pocket slide rules were good enough for quick, back-of-the-napkin calculations in the field. Engineers, however, were partial to the 25 cm desk straight rule. As such, the majority of the slide rules manufactured over the past two centuries were of this design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mannheim type—The most basic straight rule is the Mannheim type, the progenitor of the modern slide rule. Surely, applying the adjective “modern” to a device that had been deemed outmoded for over 40 years is doing gentle violence to the English language. But given that the slide rule is now over 400 years old, a 150-year-old Mannheim model is comparatively “modern”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Mannheim slide rule has $C$ and $D$ scales for arithmetic operations ($×$ and $÷$), $L$ scale for common logarithm ($log$), $A$ and $B$ scales for square and square root ($x^2$ and $\sqrt{x}$), $K$ scale for cubic and cube root ($x^3$ and $\sqrt[3]{x}$), and $S$ and $T$ scales for trigonometric functions ($sin$ and $tan$).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following is the Post 1447 simplex slide rule, manufactured by the Japanese company Hemmi in the late 1950s. As is the tradition for Japanese slide rules, this one is made of bamboo, which is a better material than wood, because bamboo is more resistant to warping and it slides more smoothly. The term “simplex” refers to the slide rules with scales on only one side of the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike its simplex frame, the slide of the Mannheim rule has engraved on its backside the $S$, $L$, and $T$ scales, which are read through the cutouts at each end. Given that the Post 1447 is a modern Mannheim rule, it has clear-plastic windows over the cutouts, and engraved on these windows are fixed red hairlines for reading the scales. These hairlines are alined with the $1$ mark on the frontside $D$ scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Classic Mannheim simplex slide rules do not have windows over the cutouts. Instead, their cutouts are cleverly placed in an offset: the right-hand cutout is aligned with the two upper scales on the backside of the slide (the $S$ and the $L$ scales) and the left-hand cutout is aligned with the two lower scales (the $L$ and the $T$ scales). It does get unwieldy when trying to read the left-edge of the $S$ scale, but this design compromise significantly reduces the need to flip the slide round to the front. If the predominant calculations are trigonometric, however, it is more convenient to just flip the slide and to use the front of the slide rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Mannheim slide rule was invented in 1859 by Amédée Mannheim, a French artillery officer, for quickly computing firing solutions in the field. It had only $C$, $D$, $A$, and $B$ scales, so it was capable of computing only $×$, $÷$, $x^2$, and $\sqrt{x}$. This suited its intended purpose. It was the forefather of the modern straight rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rietz type—A slight improvement upon the French Mannheim type was the German Rietz type, designed in 1902 for Dennert &amp;amp; Pape (D&amp;amp;P, subsequently Aristo) by Max Rietz, an engineer. It added the $ST$ scale for small angles in the range $[0.573°, $ $5.73°] = [0.01, 0.1]\ rad$. In this angular range, $sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta)$, so the combined $sin$-$tan$ scale suffices. The following is the Nestler 23 R Rietz, a German make known to be favoured by boffins, including Albert Einstein. The 23 R dates to 1907, but the example below is from the 1930s. The frontside has $K$ and $A$ scales on the upper frame; $B$, $CI$ , and $C$ scales on the slide; and $D$ and $L$ scales on the lower frame. The $CI$ scale is the reverse $C$ scale that runs from right to left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backside of the Nestler 23 R have traditional, Mannheim-style offset cutouts at each end and black index marks engraved onto the wood frame. The backside of the slide holds the $S$, $ST$, and $T$ scales. The $S$ and $ST$ scales are read in the right-hand cutout, and the $ST$ and the $T$ scales are read in the left-hand cutout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some slide rules, like this older Nestler 23 R below, came with magnifying cursor glass to allow a more precise scale reading. But I find the distorted view at the edges of the magnifier rather vexing. This model looks to be from the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Darmstadt type—Another German innovation was the Darmstadt type, designed in 1924 by Alwin Walther, a professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt, for D&amp;amp;P (Aristo). Darmstadt rule was the workhorse preferred by the early 20th century engineers. It added three $LL_n$ scales ($LL_1$, $LL_2$, and $LL_3$) which are used to compute general exponentiation of the form $x^{y/z} = \sqrt[z]{x^y}$, when $x &amp;gt; 1$. When $z = 1$, the general expression reduces to $x^y$. When $y = 1$, the general expression reduces to $x^{1/z} = \sqrt[z]{x}$. Newer, more advanced models sport the fourth $LL_0$ scale. The following is the Aristo 967 U Darmstadt from the mid 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backside of the Aristo 967 U’s slide has the $L$ and the three $LL_n$ scales. Being that it is a late model Darmstadt simplex rule with a clear plastic back, the entire lengths of these scales are visible at once—a definite improvement to usability compared to the tradition wood rules with cutouts. These scales are read against the fixed red hairline at each end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;log-log duplex type—Modern engineering slide rules generally are of the log-log duplex type. The duplex scale layout was invented by William Cox in 1895 for K&amp;amp;E. The models used by engineering students have three black $LL_n$ scales ($LL_1$, $LL_2$, and $LL_3$ running from left to right) for cases where $x &amp;gt; 1$ and three red $LL_{0n}$ scales ($LL_{01}$, $LL_{02}$, and $LL_{03}$ running from right to left) for cases where $x &amp;lt; 1$. More advanced models used by professional engineers have four black-red pairs of $LL$ scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Faber-Castell (FC) 2/83 N Novo Duplex slide rule, shown below, is a late model, advanced engineering rule from the mid 1970s. It was designed and manufactured at the close of the slide rule era. It was especially popular outside the US. It is a rather long and wide slide rule. And it was arguably one of the most aesthetically pleasing slide rules ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from sporting four black-red pairs of $LL$ scales on the backside, the FC 2/83 N has $T_1, T_2$ expanded $tan$ scales and $W_1, W_2$ specialised scale pairs for computing $\sqrt{x}$ with greater precision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Circular slide rules can be categorised into three types: simplex, pocket watch, and duplex. Circular rules were popular with businessmen, and the most popular models were of the stylish, pocket watch type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;simplex type—The diameter of the FC 8/10 circular rule is only 12 cm, but in terms of capability, it is equivalent to a 25-cm Rietz straight rule. The FC 8/10 is an atypical circular rule: most circular rules use spiral scales, but the FC 8/10 uses traditional Rietz scales in wrapped, circular form. The example shown below was made in the mid 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the FC 8/10 is a simplex circular rule, its backside holds no scales; instead it bears use instructions and a few scientific constants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pocket watch type—A more typical design for circular slide rules is the pocket watch variety, like the Fowler’s Universal Calculator shown below. William Fowler of Manchester, England, began manufacturing calculating devices in 1898. This particular model probably dates to the 1950s. Fowler slide rules were made to exacting standards, like a stylish, expensive pocket watch, and are operated like a watch, too, using the two crowns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backside of the Fowler’s Universal Calculator is covered in black leather. This device is small enough to fit in the palm and the edges of the metal case are rounded, so it is quite comfortable to hold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;duplex type—It is no secret that most engineers disliked the circular slide rule; many were downright derisive. Seymour Cray, the designer of the CRAY super computer, my favourite electrical engineer and my fellow circular slide rule fancier, once quipped, “If you had a circular [slide rule], you had some social problems in college.” But the Dempster RotaRule Model AA was the circular rule that even the most ardent straight rule enthusiast found tempting. It is a duplex circular rule. And it is exceedingly well made. Its plastic is as good as the European plastics, far superior to the plastics used by American manufacturers like K&amp;amp;E. It is the brainchild of John Dempster, an American mechanical engineer. The Dempster RotaRule Model AA shown below is probably from the late 1940s. Unconventionally, the trigonometric scales are on the frontside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backside of the Dempster RotaRule holds the four $LL_n$ scales among others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All cylindrical rules emphasise precision, so they all have very long scales. Some cylindrical rules use the helical-scale design, while others use the stacked straight-scale design. Cylindrical rules come in two types: pocket type and desk type. The business community favoured the greater precision these devices afforded. As such, most cylindrical rules were very large; they were made for the banker’s ornate mahogany desk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pocket type—The Otis King Model L, shown below, is a contradiction: it is a compact cylindrical rule that, when collapsed, is well shy of an open palm. Portability wise, this cylindrical rule could compete with larger pocket watch type circular rules. But because the Model L employs helical scales, its precision is far superior to that of common straight rules and pocket watch circular rules. This particular Model L is likely from the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;desk type—A giant among large cylindrical rules was the K&amp;amp;E 1740, designed in 1881 by Edwin Thacher, an American engineer working for K&amp;amp;E. I have never seen this device in person, so I do not know the finer points of how it was used. But the general operating principles are similar to that of the Otis King Model K: the outer cylinder is mounted to the wooden base but it can spin in place. The inner cylinder shifts and spins independently of the outer cylinder. The inner cylinder’s scale is read through the slits in the outer cylinder’s scale. Thus, the outer cylinder is analogous to the straight rule’s frame, and the inner cylinder is analogous to the straight rule’s slide. There is, however, no cursor on this device; it is unnecessary, since the large, legible scales can be lined up against each other by eye. The first Thacher model dates to 1881. The one shown in the photograph blow, a museum piece, is probably a late model from the 1950s, by the look of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ordinary engineering slide rules provide arithmetic, logarithm, exponential, and trigonometric functions. Some advanced models provide hyperbolic functions. More models provide speciality-specific functions: electronic, electrical, mechanical, chemical, civil, and so forth. Here, I shall ignore such speciality-specific rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The impetus for the slide rule’s invention was to expedite $×$ and $÷$. These arithmetic operations were performed using the $C$ and the $D$ scales. Over time, slide rule designers had created numerous scales that augment the $C$ and $D$ scales: reciprocal $CI$ and $DI$; folded $CF$ and $DF$; and folded reciprocal $CIF$ and $DIF$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1775, Thomas Everard, an English excise officer, inverted Gunter’s logarithmic scale, thus paving the way for the reciprocal $CI$ and $DI$ scales that run from right to left. Using $D$ and $C$, $a ÷ b$ is computed as $a_D - b_C$. But using $D$ and $CI$, this expression is computed as $a_D + b_{CI}$:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The $CF$, $DF$, $CIF$, and $DIF$ scales are called “folded”, because they fold the $C$, $D$, $CI$, and $DI$ scales, respectively, at $\pi$, thereby shifting the $1$ mark to the middle of the scale. The following photograph shows these auxiliary scales on the slide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These auxiliary scales often reduce slide and cursor movement distances considerably, thereby speeding up computations. But I shall not present the detailed procedures on using these auxiliary scales, because they are procedural optimisations not essential to understanding slide rule fundamentals. Interested readers may refer to the user’s manuals, which are listed in the resource section at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The logarithm $L$ scale is the irony of the slide rule. The $log$ function is nonlinear. But because the slide rule is based upon this very same nonlinearity, the $L$ scale appears linear when inscribed on the slide rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $log(2)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;squaring on slide rule—A typical engineering slide rule provides the $A$ scale on the frame and the $B$ scale on the slide for computing $x^2$, the $K$ scale on the frame for computing $x^3$, and the $LL_n$ scales and their reciprocals $LL_{0n}$ scales on the frame for computing $x^y$. The procedures for computing powers and roots always involve the $D$ scale on the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $3^2$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The $A$-$D$ scale pair computes $x^2$, because $A$ is a double-cycle logarithmic scale and $D$ is a single-cycle logarithmic scale. In the reverse direction, the $D$-$A$ scale pair computes $\sqrt{x}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $\sqrt{9}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But placing the hairline on $9$ in the second cycle of the $A$ scale would compute $\sqrt{90} = 9.49$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cubing on slide rule—It is a little known fact that Isaac Newton invented the cubic $K$ scale in 1675 by solving the cubic equation. The $K$-$D$ scale pair computes $x^3$ because $K$ is a triple-cycle logarithmic scale. And the reverse $D$-$K$ scale pair computes $\sqrt[3]{x}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $3^3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When computing $\sqrt[3]{x}$, the digits to the left of the decimal are grouped by threes, and if the left-most group has one digit (say $1,000$) then place the argument in $K$ scale’s first cycle; if two digits (say $22,000$) then in the second cycle; and if three digits (say $333,000$) then in the third cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $\sqrt[3]{64000}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Placing the hairline on $6.4$ in the first cycle of the $K$ scale would compute $\sqrt[3]{6.4} = 1.857$, and placing the hairline on $640$ in the third cycle of the $K$ scale would compute $\sqrt[3]{640} = 8.62$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;logarithmic exponentiation—General exponentiation of the form $x^{y/z}$ can be reduced to arithmetic operations by applying the $log$ function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, $×$ and $÷$ can be further reduced to $+$ and $-$ by applying the $log$ function once more:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that the slide rule performs this trick using the base-$e$ natural logarithm $ln$ as the inner logarithm and the base-$10$ common logarithm $log$ as the outer logarithm. That is, the function composition is actually $log \circ ln$, not $log \circ log$. The $ln$ is used instead of the $log$ for the inner logarithm, in order to compress the range of the $LL_n$ scale, thereby improving reading precision. Hence, computing $x^{y/z}$ on the slide rule is equivalent to performing the following logarithmic operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, computing $2^4$ and $\sqrt[4]{16}$ on the slide rule proceed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now see that the “log-log” nomenclature of engineering slide rules is a not-so-subtle nod to the function composition $\color{blue}{log} \circ \color{green}{ln}$ that appears in the expressions computing $x^{y/z}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the slide rule, the $LL$ scales compute general exponentiation $x^{y/z}$. It is, therefore, reasonable to ask, “If the $LL$ scale pairs can compute arbitrary powers and roots, why waste precious real estate with the redundant $A$, $B$, and $K$ scales?” The answer is convenience. Engineering calculations make frequent use of squares (for Pythagoreans and areas) and cubes (for volumes), and these scales provide quick calculations of those operations. Although the $LL$ scales possess greater flexibility and precision, their procedures are commensurately more intricate and error prone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recall that reading the result on the $D$ scale implicitly performs $log^{-1}$. Likewise, reading the result on the $LL_n$ scale implicitly performs $ln^{-1}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;natural logarithm scale—The black $LL_n$ scale is closely related to the base-$e$ ($e = 2.718$) natural logarithm $ln$. The $LL_n$ and the $D$ scales are related by a bijective function $ln$:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the plot below, the black curve is $ln$ and the red is $ln^{-1}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The special name for $ln^{-1}$ is exponential function $e^x$. The $LL_n$ and the $D$ scales form a transform pair that converts between the base-$e$ natural logarithm scale and the base-$10$ common logarithm scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike the $D$ scale, the black $LL_n$ scale is not cyclic; it is one long scale. On the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3, the black $LL_n$ scale is divided into these three ranges:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These ranges of the $LL_n$ scales clearly show the rate of exponential growth. The function composition $log \circ ln$ used to derive the $LL_n$ scales, so that the $LL_3$ scale lines up perfectly with the $D$ scale: $log(ln(e)) = 0$ and $log(ln(22000)) = 1$. The lower $LL_n$ scales are similarly derived in accordance with their respective ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Had we used the $log \circ log$ function composition to construct the $LL_n$ scales, the range of the $LL_3$ scale would be $[10^1, 10^{10}]$, instead. Shrinking this galactic scale down to a 25-cm length would make the scale resolution unusably coarse. The function $e^x$ is famous for its fast growth rate, but $10^x$ beats it, hands down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The red $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scales are reciprocals of the black $LL_n$ scales. As such, these scales run from right to left. On the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3, the red $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scale is divided into these ranges:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the $LL$ scales are intimately linked to $ln$, and by extension to $e^x$, many slide rules label the $LL_n$ scales as $e^x$ and the $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scales as $e^{-x}$. Note the terminology: the term “exponentiation” refers to the expression $x^y$, and the term “exponential” refers to the function $e^x$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $ln(2)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $ln(3)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computing $e^x$, however, is not the primary purpose of the $LL$ scale pairs; Peter Roget, an English physician and the creator of the Roget Thesaurus, designed this scale to compute arbitrary powers and roots in the form of $x^{y/z}$. The black $LL_n$ scales are for computing powers and roots of $x &amp;gt; 1$, and the red $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ for $x &amp;lt; 1$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we have seen earlier, multiplication and division start and end on the fixed $D$ scale and requires the use of the sliding the $C$ scale. Likewise, exponentiation starts and ends on the fixed $LL$ scales and requires the use of the sliding $C$ scale. At a glance, computing $x^y$ seems as straightforward as computing $x × y$. But in truth, the $LL$ scales are beguiling; using them correctly requires care, and using them quickly requires practice. A typical first-year engineering student takes several weeks of regular use to become proficient with the $LL$ scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The procedures for computing $x^y$ using the $LL$ scales are complex enough that they warrant being split into two cases: when $x &amp;gt; 1$ and when $x &amp;lt; 1$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;exponentiation for the $x &amp;gt; 1$ case—If $x &amp;gt; 1$, we use the $LL_n$ scales and the $C$ scale to compute $x^y$ as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $1.03^{2.4}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we get into a bit of a quandary. Say, we wish to compute $1.03^{9.2}$. We line up the $C$ scale’s left-hand $1$ with the $LL_1$ scale’s $1.03$. But now, the $C$ scale’s $9.2$ has fallen off the right edge of the slide rule. What this indicates is that we have exceeded the upper limit of the $LL_1$ scale from whence we began, and have ventured onto the $LL_2$ scale. That means we must read the result on the $LL_2$ scale. In order to avoid going off the edge, we instead use the folded $CF$ scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $1.03^{9.2}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the exponent is negative, we read the result on the $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scale. Because $x^{-y} = 1/x^y$ and $LL_n = 1/\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$, computing $x^y$ on the $LL_n$ scale but reading the result on the $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scale yields $x^{-y}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $2.22^{-1.11}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Had we read the result on the $LL_2$ scale, we would have computed $2.22^{1.11} = 2.434$. But by reading the result on the $\color{red}{LL_{02}}$ scale, we compute the reciprocal $1/2.434 = 0.413$, as desired. The $LL$ scales are the most powerful scales on an engineering straight rule. But with that power comes numerous traps for the unweary. Interested readers may read the user’s manuals listed in the resources section at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When computing $2.22^{-1.11}$ above, we used the $CI$ scale, instead of the $C$ scale, as usual. This is because the base $2.22$ is far to the right edge of the slide rule, had we used the $C$ scale, the slide would be hanging almost entirely off the right edge. Using the $CI$ scale in this case reduces the slide movement distance, considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;exponentiation for the $x &amp;lt; 1$ case—If $x &amp;lt; 1$, we use the $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scales and the $C$ scale to compute $x^y$. The procedures for the $\color{red}{LL_{0n}}$ scales are analogously categorised into four ranges of the exponent, the details of which I shall forego.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $0.222^{1.11}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigonometric functions are related to each other by these identities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the plot below, the blue curve is $sin$, the green is $cos$, and the red is $tan$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;black $S$ scale—The $S$ scale on the slide rule is graduated in degrees from $5.73°$ to $90°$. When $\theta ∈ [5.73°, 90°]$ on the $S$ scale, $sin(\theta) ∈ [0.1, 1.0]$ on the $C$ scale. The $S$ and the $C$ scales are related by a bijective function $sin$:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the plot below, the black curve is $sin$ and the blue is $sin^{-1}$. Note that the inverse function (here $sin^{-1}$) is a reflection in the $y = x$ line of the original function (here $sin$). In the figure below, the $x$-axis represents the angle $\theta$ in radians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $sin(30°)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $\theta$ in the expression $sin(\theta) = 0.866$, we do the opposite: set the argument $0.866$ on the $C$ scale and read the result $60°$ on the $S$ scale. This computes $\theta = sin^{-1}(0.866) = 60°$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;red $\color{red}{S}$ scale—The $S$ scale is graduated from left to right, in black, for $sin$ between the angles $5.73°$ and $90°$. But since $cos(\theta) = sin(90° - \theta)$, the $cos$ scale is readily combined into the $S$ scale, but in the reverse direction and marked in red. Hence, $cos(\theta)$ is computed using the same procedure, but in reference to the red $\color{red}{S}$ scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the plot below, the red curve is $cos$ and the blue is $cos^{-1}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;black $T$ scale—The $T$ scale is graduated in degrees from $5.73°$ to $45°$. When $\theta ∈ [5.73°, 45°]$ on the $T$ scale, $tan(\theta) ∈ [0.1, 1.0]$ on the $C$ scale. The $T$ and the $C$ scales are related by a bijective function $tan$:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the plot below, the black curve is $tan$ and the blue is $tan^{-1}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;red $\color{red}{T}$ scale—The $T$ scale, too, has red markings, running right to left, for $\theta ∈ [45°, 84.29°]$. The red $\color{red}{T}$ scale is used for $tan(\theta) ∈ [1 \rightarrow 10]$ and for $cot(\theta) ∈ [1.0 \leftarrow 0.1]$. The red $\color{red}{T}$ scale is used in conjunction with the reciprocal $CI$ scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $tan(83°)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since $cot(\theta) = tan(90° - \theta) = 1/tan(\theta)$, we may compute $cot(\theta)$ using the black $T$ scale or the red $\color{red}{T}$ scale, as per the procedure described above. So, to compute $cot(83°)$, we use the same procedure as $tan(83°)$ on the red $\color{red}{T}$ scale, but read the result $cot(83°) = 1/tan(83°) = 0.1228$ on the $C$ scale, instead of the $CI$ scale. Alternatively, we may compute $tan(90° - 83°)$ on the black $T$ scale, and read the result $cot(83°) = tan(7°) = 0.1228$ also on the $C$ scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the plot below, the red curve is $cot$ and the green is $cot^{-1}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$ST$ or $SRT$ scale—The $ST$ scale is used to compute $sin$ and $tan$ for small angles in the range $[0.573°, 5.73°] = [0.01, 0.1]\ rad$, because $sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta)$ for small angles. For such small angles, we may exploit another approximation: $sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta) \approx \theta\ rad$, where the angle $\theta$ is measured in radians. For this reason, some manufacturers, like K&amp;amp;E, label the $ST$ scale as $SRT$ for $sin$-$rad$-$tan$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the plot below, the blue curve is $sin$ and the red is $tan$. These two curves are indistinguishable when $\theta ∈ [0.0, 0.1]\ rad$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is possible to chain trigonometric and arithmetic calculations on the slide rule. This is one of the reasons why calculating with the slide rule is so much faster than using tables. Those who are interested in these details should read the user’s manuals listed in the resources section at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;calibrating—When an adjustable slide rule, like the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3, goes askew (but not warped), its accuracy can be restore by recalibrating. The frame of this duplex slide rule consists of the fixed lower portion and the adjustable upper portion. The two faces of the cursor are independently adjustable, as well. We calibrate this slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frustrating though it can be to recalibrate a skewed slide rule, that is the easy bit. Reading the scales with adequate precision, however, is trickier, especially for those of us with poor eyesights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cleaning—I can say nothing about maintaining and cleaning vintage Thacher-style large cylindrical rules, since I have never even seen one in person. But straight rules, circular rules, and Otis King-style cylindrical rules should be cleaned by gently wiping down with clean, moist (but not dripping wet) microfibre cloth or paper towel, then dry off the moisture, immediately. Although plastic and aluminium rules can withstand water, wood and bamboo rules cannot. Note that the black handle (the cursor) on the Otis King is actually a black-painted brass cylinder. Aggressive rubbing can scrub off the black paint. And be forewarned: never use chemical solvents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With use, the slide can get sticky, over time. This is caused by the grime—an amalgam of dust and skin oil—that collect in the crevices between the slide and the frame. This grime can be cleaned with a moist microfibre cloth or paper towel. Do not apply lemon oil, grease, powder, graphite, or any other foreign substance to the slide rule, and especially never to the slide-frame contact areas. Not only does the slide rule not require lubricants, these foreign substances could mar, or perhaps even damage, the device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dust also tends to gather under the cursor glass. The easiest way to remove the dust is to blow it out using a compressed air canister. To remove stubborn stains under the glass, however, the cursor may need to be disassembled and cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are reading this article, odds are that you do not own a slide rule. It is my hope that you would acquire one, say from eBay, and learn to use it. Your first slide rule should not be a rare, collector’s item; it should be something like the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 Log Log Duplex Decitrig or the Post 1460 Versalog—a cheap, but good, model. If you do end up buying one, yours will most likely be grimy and discoloured, for having been kept in a dusty storage bin for decades. Do not despair; most old slide rules can be renewed to a good extent. The grime and discolouration can be removed by gently—I mean gently—rubbing with the soft, foamy side of a moist (but not dripping wet) kitchen sponge loaded with a spot of dish soap. If you do decide to attack a stain with the rough side of the sponge, use care and judgement, or you will scrub off the scale markings. Use extra care, when scrubbing painted slide rules, like the Pickett aluminium rules. And if yours is a wood slide rule, minimise its contact with water. Immediately dry off the slide rule after cleaning. Do not apply heat as a drying aid. And I strongly suggest that you clean in stages, removing the grime layer by layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section is about collecting slide rules: what to look for, how to purchase, how to avoid pitfalls, etc. I collect slide rules; this should surprise no one reading this article. But I am an atypical collector. I buy but I do not sell. I do not engage in bidding wars on eBay. Most of the slide rules I collect are those that I coveted as a young engineering student in the early 1980s. A few are cheap curiosities. More importantly, I buy slide rules that are not “collector-grade”. That is, my slide rules have high accuracy, but they do not necessarily have high resale value: most are not rarities; some have former owners’ names engraved upon them; many do not come with cases, manuals, wrappings, boxes, and other accoutrement of collecting. Moreover, whereas most collectors favour top-of-the-line, sophisticated, powerful slide rules, I am partial to the humble Darmstadt rule, for this type offers the best balance in terms of density, simplicity, and utility. And as much as I like the Darmstadt rules, I dislike having to use the pocket rules, mainly due to my poor eyesight. Nevertheless, pocket rules are perfectly serviceable; Apollo astronauts staked their lives on it, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main goal in collecting slide rules is to play, not to display. Although these simple instruments no longer hold practical value today, they were once instrumental in creating immense value for humanity. I acknowledge that fact by collecting them. And by using them, I am able to appreciate more deeply the ingenuity of my forebears, the 19th century engineers who propelled forward humanity and slide rule design. To perpetuate this appreciation, I taught my son how to use slide rules, starting when he was a third-grader. I am motivated by knowledge and nostalgia, not by possessory pride or pecuniary purpose. So, when perusing my collection described herein, take my biases into account: a collection is a reflection of the collector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a little perspective. In the 1950s, an ordinary engineering slide rule, like the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3, was priced around 20 USD, now. In today’s money, that slide rule would cost about 230 USD. By way of comparison, the HP Prime calculator—the ultimate weapon of an engineer—with reverse Polish notation (RPN), computer algebra system (CAS), BASIC programming language, 3D plotting, colour touchscreen, and a whole lot more, costs about 100 USD, new, in 2021. A refurbished Dell laptop with Intel Core i5 CPU and 4 GB of RAM costs about 130 USD. Are you all astonishment?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I purchased all my slide rules on eBay, except these: the Aristo 0968, which was the required equipment at my engineering school in early 1980s Burma, and I purchased it from the government store; the FC 8/10, which was owned by my engineer aunt, who gifted it to me when I entered engineering school; the FC 67/64 R and the FC 2/83 N, which I purchased new from the Faber-Castell online store a couple of decades ago, when the company still had new old-stock (NOS) slide rules; and the Concise Model 300, which I purchased new from Concise online store several years ago. Concise still makes slide rules today, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below, I arranged my collection by slide rule variety (straight, circular, and cylindrical); within each variety by brandname; and under each brandname by capability (Mannheim, Rietz, Darmstadt, log-log duplex, and vector). I took the photographs with a tripod-mounted camera from a fixed position, so as to show the relative sizes of the slide rules. A typical straight rule is approximately 30 cm in overall length, so it should be easy to ascertain the absolute sizes of the devices from these photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do note that sellers (brands) are not manufacturers, in some cases. For example, Frederick Post (est. 1890), a well-known American company, sold under the Post brand topping bamboo slide rules designed and manufactured by Hemmi of Japan. Hemmi (est. 1895) also sold their superb bamboo slide rules under their own brand. And Keuffel &amp;amp; Esser (est. 1867), the leading American designer and manufacturer of high-quality slide rules, began life as an importer of German slide rules. Also of note was that German manufacturers, Faber-Castell (est. 1761), Aristo (est. 1862), and Nestler (est. 1878), were in West Germany (FRD) during the Cold War, but Reiss (est. 1882) was in East Germany (DDR). And Kontrolpribor (est. 1917), a Russian manufacturer, is more properly labelled a factory in the former Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we proceed, here are some admonishments for those who are buying slide rules for using, not merely for possessing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My slide rule collection spans several models from each of the following major manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aristo (DE)—Aristo was the slide rule brandname of the German company Dennert &amp;amp; Pape (D&amp;amp;P), founded in 1872. They make top quality rules with understated good looks. D&amp;amp;P were a thought leader in the early part of 20th century. They invented the Rietz scale in 1902 and the Darmstadt scale in 1924. And in 1936, they abandoned wood and began making all-plastic slide rules under the Aristo brand. Plastic is more stable than wood and, hence, a better slide rule material. This high-quality plastic became their signature material. The brandname Aristo eventually became the company name. I have a particular affinity for Aristo because of my first slide rule, the Aristo 0968.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blundell-Harling (UK)—Blundell-Harling are an English stationary manufacturer that make technical drawing supplies, today. Back in the day, their BRL slide rules were highly regarded. During the nearly four-century reign of the slide rule, almost every industrialised nation had at least one slide rule manufacturer. But the English slide rules—straight, circular, cylindrical, the lot—were generally superior in terms of craftsmanship and materials. It makes sense in a way; the English invented the slide rule, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Breitling (CH)—Breitling are a famed Swiss watchmaker. They were founded in 1884. They have long been associated with aviation. Their Navitimer line is the first wristwatch with integrated chronograph and slide rule, introduced in 1952 for use by pilots. Instrument flying in those days required pilots to use the cockpit flight instruments together with an accurate chronometer (for flight time, arrival time, etc.), a chronograph (for timed turns, holding patterns, ground speed, etc.), and a slide rule (for navigation, fuel burn calculations, etc.). The Navitimer fulfilled all three needs, because it was a chronometer-grade wristwatch, a chronograph, and a slide rule, all in one. Although flying today had become automated, traditional-minded pilots continue to admire the Navitimer for its history, quality, and utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concise (JP)—Concise are a Japanese maker of drawing and measuring tools. They made good, but low-cost, plastic, circular slide rules. Today in the 21st century, they are the only company still making slide rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dempster (US)—Dempster were a boutique American manufacturer of top quality circular slide rules. They were founded by John Dempster, a Berkeley graduate mechanical engineer, who began manufacturing the Dempster RotaRule in 1928, in the basement of his home in Berkeley, California. The company made only one type of slide rule, and it is the most advanced, and the most desirable, circular slide rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Faber-Castell (DE)—Founded in 1761, Faber-Castell (FC) began life as an office supply company. Today, they remain one of the oldest, and largest, stationary companies. They are now famous for their quality pens and pencils. But for about 100 years, until 1975, FC were a worldwide leader in slide rule making.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fowler (UK)—Fowler were an English maker of pocket watch slide rules, which they called “calculators”. They were founded in 1853, and they held numerous British patents on pocket watch slide rules. Fowler rules were of superlative quality, constructed like expensive pocket watches. And these devices came in high-quality, wooden cases that resembled jewellery boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gilson (US)—Gilson, established in the 1930s, were an American maker of cheap, but powerful, aluminium circular rules with spiral scales. They made many models, both large (almost 22 cm diameter) and small (about 12 cm diameter), but all were of the same, three-cursor design. In some ways, Gilson circular rules expressed the traditional, American engineering philosophy: big, brash, gaudy, tough, powerful, and usable, but cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graphoplex (FR)—Graphoplex were a French maker of splendid-looking slide rules, but with a horrid-looking logo. In terms of quality, French slide rules are on par with German ones. Graphoplex’s sector-dial watch face style scales are quite pleasing to the eye. Although this visual design was common in the late 19th century, it disappeared during the early 20th century. Some early German wood rules used this visual design, but later wood rules abandoned it. Graphoplex, though, carried this visual design to their modern plastic rules, giving these devices a rather unique classic look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hemmi (JP)—Established in 1895, Hemmi designed and manufactured top-quality, innovative slide rules. They made accurate, elegant instruments using quality materials. Their signature material was bamboo. Bamboo is perhaps the best material with which to make slide rules. It is tough, stable, and naturally slippery. I adore Hemmi rules. Today, they make high-tech electronic devices. Yet, they continue to use the name Hemmi Slide Rule Co., Ltd., proudly displaying their illustrious heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keuffel &amp;amp; Esser (US)—Keuffel &amp;amp; Esser (K&amp;amp;E) were the most successful manufacturer of quality slide rules in America. They were founded in 1867 by a pair of German immigrants. Initially, they only imported German slide rules. But soon, they began designing and making their own slide rules. K&amp;amp;E were quite innovative. The duplex design was one of theirs, invented for them by William Cox in 1895. Their signature material was mahogany. Mahogany is a good material for slide rule, but it is neither as robust nor as stable as bamboo. K&amp;amp;E also made several plastic rules, but their plastic is of a much lower grade, compared to the European plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kontrolpribor (RU)—Kontrolpribor was a Soviet factory that made pocket watch slide rules. Like other Soviet products, Kontrolpribor devices feel cheap, but sturdy. Today, Kontrolpribor make high-tech scientific instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loga (CH)—Loga were a Swiss maker of superb technical instruments, including circular and cylindrical slide rules. They were founded in the early 20th century. Until about the late 19th century, Switzerland was the home of cheap, high-quality craftsmen. French, German, and English watchmakers relied extensively on the highly skilled Swiss labour force to hand-make their high-end watches. That was how the modern Swiss watch industry was born. So, it is no surprise that 20th century Swiss slide rules exhibit similar craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logarex (CZ)—Logarex was a factory in Czechoslovakia, when the country was part of the old Eastern Bloc. Like most everything manufactured in the Eastern Bloc countries during the Soviet Era, Logarex slide rules feel cheap, but usable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nestler (DE)—Nestler were a German maker of high-quality slide rules. They were established in 1878. Their mahogany rules were the stuff of legend. Even their very old wood rules from the early 20th century have a modern, minimalist look-and-feel to them. Of all the German brands, Nestler is my favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otis King (UK)—Otis King was an English electrical engineer. His company made high-quality pocket cylindrical rules, starting around 1922. They made only two types—the Model K and the Model L—both of which are described, below. And despite being designed by an electrical engineer, these rules are not suitable for daily use in engineering, given their limited capabilities. The focus of these rules is on portability and precision, the two characteristics treasured by businessmen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pickett &amp;amp; Eckel (US)—Pickett, established in 1943, were a newcomer to the American slide rule market. Their signature material was aluminium. And most of their rules wore their trade-dress, the Pickett Eye-Saver Yellow. To be honest, I detest the cold, sharp edges of the aluminium and the gaudy eye-slayer yellow. But loads of American engineers fancied Pickett rules. Not withstanding my opinion, this slide rule is a solid performer. Aluminium is thermally much more stable than wood. And it is well-neigh indestructible. Nevertheless, Pickett aluminium rules feel cheap to me—my apologies to NASA who, for their Apollo missions, chose the Pickett N600-ES, a pared-down, pocket version of the popular Pickett N3-ES.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frederick Post (US)—Frederick Post were an American importer of top-quality Hemmi bamboo rules. These bamboo rules were sold under the Post brand in America. Frederick Post morphed into Teledyne Post in 1970, and continued making drafting supplies until they were dissolved in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reiss (DE)—Reiss were a German slide rule maker, established in 1882. During the Cold War, it diminished to a Soviet-style factory in East Germany. But unlike their fellow Eastern Bloc countrymen, the East Germans staunchly clung on to their German culture that held craftsmanship in high regard. As such, Reiss rules are good quality instruments, comparable to Western European brands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aristo 967 U Darmstadt—The Aristo 967 U is a late-model, advanced Darmstadt slide rule. Unlike the older Darmstadt rules, the backside of Aristo 967 U is clear plastic, which allows the user to see the entire backside of the slide which, in keeping with the Darmstadt tradition, holds the $L$ scale and the three $LL_n$ scales. And in accordance with that tradition, this slide rule is of a simplex design. As such, the cursor does not reach the backside; the backside scales are read against the fixed red hairlines at each end. Typical of all Aristo slide rules, the frame, the slide, and the cursor are made of a very high-grade plastic, allowing all these bits to glide smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many late-model, plastic Darmstadt rules, like the Aristo 967 U, have thin lips protruding from the frame, often marked with 25-cm and 10-in ruler scales. Unfortunately, the corners of these lips are rather fragile. These corners chipped off, if the slide rule was dropped. Pay attention to this type of damage, when purchasing a plastic Darmstadt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frankly, I fail to see the value of inscribing ruler scales on a slide rule. All engineers use the triangular rule for measuring and drafting. This ruler is always on our desks. And on the very first day in engineering school, we were taught never to use the slide rule—a precision instrument—like a common ruler. So, putting ruler scales on a slide rule is simply wasting precious real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aristo 0968 Studio—The Aristo 0968 is an ordinary log-log duplex engineering straight rule, like the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3. But this slide rule is about half a centimetre wider than the slender K&amp;amp;E 4081-3. This extra space affords a couple of extra scales and a more logical scale layout. The Aristo 0968 has the Pythagorean $P$ scale for computing $1 - x^2$ and two $tan$ scales $T_1\ [5.5°, 45°]$ and $T_2\ [45°, 84.5°]$, which the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 does not have. And all three pairs of $LL$ scales are placed on the backside, making it a much more convenient rule to use for exponentiation—a good trait for an engineering rule. Indeed, usability is the hallmark of European and Asian slide rules; this is the area in which American slide rules falter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Aristo 0968 was my first slide rule, purchased from the government store in Burma, circa 1982, upon my arrival at the engineering college, then the only one of its kind in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aristo 0969 StudioLog—The Arist 0969 is a top-of-the-line engineering duplex slide rule, with four pairs of $LL$ scales, $P$ scale, extended trigonometric scales, etc. In terms of capabilities, it is identical to its more famous competitor, the FC 2/83 N. But being half centimetre or so wider, the Aristo 0969 is a monster of a slide rule. This extra real estate allows a bit of extra spacing between the scales, arguably making them easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the excessive girth of the Aristo 0969 makes it awkward to flip. It is not one of my favourites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BRL D.26 Darmstadt—The BRL D.26 is a late model Darmstadt. In terms of capabilities, the BRL D.26 is comparable to its contemporary, the Aristo 0967 U. But this English rule’s build quality is obviously superior to that of its German competitor. The backside of the BRL D.26 sports the traditional cutout for reading the three $LL_n$ scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like the BRL D.26, not only for its Darmstadt design, but also because of its superior quality and its quiet elegance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FC 1/54 Darmstadt—I rather like the sensible scale layout of the FC 1/54. The back of the slide has the usual three $LL_n$ scales, which are read through the cutouts covered with hairline-inscribed clear plastic. Being of a classic German simplex design, this rule is narrow, but quite thick, compared to modern duplex rules. This thickness gives enough space to the top and bottom edges of the frame for additional scales. The top edge has the 27-cm ruler scale and the $L$ scale, and the bottom edge has the $S$ and the $T$ trigonometric scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I stated earlier, I adore Darmstadt rules. The FC 1/54 is one of my favourite Darmstadt rules. But it is not my absolute favourite Darmstadt rule. Which rule is my absolute favourite? Read on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FC 67/64 R Pocket Darmstadt mit Addiator—The FC 67/64 R is a Darmstadt pocket straight rule of about 15 cm in length. Being a Darmstadt rule, the backside of the slide has the usual three $LL_n$ scales. But instead of the traditional cutouts, the backside of the slide rule is occupied by a metal Addiator. As such, the only way to use the $LL_n$ scales is to flip the slide round to the front.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Addiator is a clever little contraption capable of performing addition and subtraction. The device must be reset before each operation by pulling out the bar at the top. The Addiator on the backside of this slide rule is capable of dealing with six significant figures. The operand is entered by dragging with the provided stylus a slot next to the desired digit in the appropriate column. When adding, both augend and addend are set in the upper register. When subtracting, the minuend is set in the upper register and the subtrahend in the lower register. The way the Addiator handles the carry is particularly clever. The mechanisms of this device work on similar principles as the mechanical calculator. But the Addiator is only 1 mm thick and fits neatly behind a pocket slide rule. Given that this is an article about slide rules, however, I shall say no more about this fascinating instrument. The curious may view YouTube videos on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Addiator does make the backside of the FC 67/64 R’s slide inaccessible. But considering the computation power afforded by the Addiator, this may well be a worthwhile compromise in some applications. I purchased this FC 67/64 R, new, straight from the Faber-Castell online store, many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FC 1/98 Elektro—The FC 1/98 is an advanced Darmstadt rule designed for electrical power engineers (as opposed to electronic engineers). It is of the classic German simplex design—narrow and thick. As such, it has specialised scales, like the $kW$ scale for computing power $P$, the $Dynamo$-$Motor$ scale for computing percent power efficiency ($η = P_{out} / P_{in}$) of generators and motors, and the $Volt$ scale for computing voltage drop along copper wires. Note that the term “dynamo” was an older name for generator, and motor is the dual of generator. The $Dynamo$-$Motor$ scale and the $Volt$ scale are engraved in the trough of the frame, under the slide. That is a creative use of the limited space. The frame holds the $LL_2$ and $LL_3$, but no $LL_1$. The bottom edge of the frame holds the $K$ scale. The backside of the slide holds the $S$, $L$, and $T$ Mannheim scales, which are read through the traditional, offset cutouts without clear plastic covers. So, the FC 1/98 is a rather unique rule that combines Mannheim, Darmstadt, and electrical engineering scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FC 1/98 is, for sure, a speciality slide rule for electrical engineers. But it is general enough to qualify as a Darmstadt-ish engineering rule. And its space-efficient scale layout deserves recognition. As such, I chose to include it in this article. But I did leave out other speciality engineering rules in my collection—transmission line Smith chart, electronic engineering rule, mechanical engineering rule, chemical engineering rule, E-6B navigation rule, etc.—because they are too far afield from the primary purpose of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FC 2/83 N Novo-Duplex—The FC 2/83 N is famous both for its evident usability as well as for its elegant beauty. Yes, contrary to the prevailing view, we engineers do appreciate aesthetics. The FC 2/83 N uses pale green backgrounds for $C$ and $CF$ on the frontside and $C$ and $D$ on the backside. It uses pale blue backgrounds for $A$ and $B$ on the frontside. In my opinion—and this view sprang from my experience with human factors in user interface design—FC 2/83 N’s colour-coded scale backgrounds are a better design choice than the Aristo 0969’s spread-out scales. And the FC 2/83 N has on the backside the $W_1$-$W^{‘}_1$ and $W_2$-$W^{‘}_2$ extended square root scales, which the Aristo 0969 lacks. That is impressive, considering the Aristo 0969 is a good half-centimetre wider than the FC 2/83 N. Also, as can be seen in the photograph below, the FC 2/83 N’s slide has black grooves at its tips. These striations make it easier to pull out the slide from its stowed position. Little things like this make big differences in usability and convenience, especially when operating under time pressure—like in an examination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would like to draw attention to the fact that the 1970s were, how shall I say it tactfully, “unique” in terms of design taste. All right, they were loud, they were excessive. In that era of paisleys and bell-bottoms, German slide rule design—typified by the Aristo 0969, the FC 2/83 N, and the Nestler 0292—managed to remain tastefully restrained. I purchased this FC 2/83 N, new, straight from the Faber-Castell online store, many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graphoplex 643 Pocket Electric Log Log—The Graphoplex 643 is an advanced pocket rule. Of all my pocket rules—which I have but a few, due to my poor eyesight—I find this one the easiest to read. This pocket rule is a miniature version of the Graphoplex 640. See the full description in the Graphoplex 640 subsection, below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graphoplex 640 Electric Log Log—The Graphoplex 640 is another topping Darmstadt rule, like the BRL D.26. But breaking from the Darmstadt tradition, the Graphoplex 640 places the three $LL_n$ scales on the frontside, on the lower frame. And the backside of the slide holds the trigonometric scales and the $C$ scale, which are read through a single cutout on the right side of the rule. The cutout has a clear plastic cover with a hairline, which makes it easy to read all four scales on the backside of the slide. But having only one cutout makes it cumbersome to read the left-hand portions of these scales. The Graphoplex 640 places the three $LL_n$ scales together with the $D$ and $C$ scales. This arrangement significantly improves usability by reducing the need frequently to flip the slide rule when computing exponentiations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Graphoplex 643 and the Graphoplex 640 were marketed as speciality electrical engineering slide rules. But they are fairly conventional Darmstadt rules. I like these rules very much. Yet, they are not my absolute favourite Darmstadt rules. Read on, to find out which one is my absolute favourite Darmstadt engineering slide rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hemmi 135 Pocket Advanced Darmstadt—The Hemmi 135 pocket rule is a marvel: it is a miniature version of the Hemmi 130W, an advanced Darmstadt rule, except for a minor difference with the $LL_n$ scales on the backside of the slide. Whereas the Hemmi 130W has four $LL_n$ scales, the Hemmi 135 has only three, given its diminutive size. See the full description in the Hemmi 130W subsection, below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hemmi 130W Advanced Darmstadt—The Hemmi 130W is my absolute favourite Darmstadt rule. There, I said it. I would very much like to have owned this rule, when I was a young engineering student those many years ago. As with all Hemmi slide rules, this rule is made of bamboo, my favourite slide rule material. The $S$, $T$, and $P$ scales, along with the usual ones, are on the frontside. Traditional Darmstadt rules have only $LL_1$, $LL_2$, and $LL_3$ on the backside of the slide. But the Hemmi 130W’s slide has four $LL_n$ scales: $LL_0$, $LL_1$, $LL_2$, and $LL_3$. This makes this slide rule one of the most powerful Darmstadt simplex rules. The $L$ and the $LL_n$ scales are read through large cutouts at each end. The plastic cover of each cutout is inscribed with a fixed red hairline for reading the scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I adore Darmstadt rules. I said so, often. And of all the Darmstadt rules I own, I love the Hemmi 130W the most. Yet, I think Hemmi missed an opportunity with the way they used the real estate of the top and bottom edges of the frame. Typical of Hemmi simplex rules, this one is fairly thick. The top edge of the frame holds a vapid 27-cm ruler and the bottom edge holds an odd zero-centred 26-cm ruler with 13-cm linear scales crawling out to each end. Hemmi should, instead, have inscribed more useful scales, like the $ST$ scale or the split $T_1$-$T_2$ scales, on the frame edges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hemmi 153 Electrical Engineer—The Hemmi 153 is a log-log vector duplex rule cherished by electrical power engineers. In terms of capabilities, this slide rule is comparable to the more famous K&amp;amp;E 4083-3 described below in the K&amp;amp;E section. But the Hemmi 153 computes the hyperbolic functions in a rather unique and ingenious way, using the Gudermannian function, introduced in 1833 by Christoph Gudermann, a German mathematician:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function $gd$, thus, relates trigonometric functions with hyperbolic functions as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backside of the Hemmi 153 has the $\theta$ angle scale in the range $[0°, 90°]$, the $P$ scale for computing $sin$, and the $Q$ scale for computing $cos$. The frontside has the $T$ scale for computing $tan$ and the $G_\theta$ scale for computing $gd(x)$. Using the $G_\theta$ scale and the $P$, $Q$, and $T$ scales of the Hemmi 153, we can compute all the hyperbolic functions. The $G_\theta$ scale, thus, expands the power of this slide rule by using the real estate for just one extra scale. I am of the opinion that the Hemmi 153 is one of those rare inventions that attained the design ideal of pragmatic minimalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $sin(30°)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $cos(60°)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the asymmetry between the $sin$ and $cos$ procedures, above. This is a consequence of the $P$ and $Q$ scales’ dual-use design: they are used to compute Pythagorean, but they also double as the $sin$ and $cos$ scales. It is, therefore, faster to compute $cos(60°)$ as $sin(90° - 60°)$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the cleverer bit: computing hyperbolic functions without various hyperbolic scales. To compute $sinh(0.5)$ using the identity $tan(gd(x)) = sinh(x)$ mentioned above, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $tanh(0.5)$ using the identity $sin(gd(x)) = tanh(x)$ mentioned above, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using the $T$ scale on the Hemmi 153 where the angle $\theta$ scale goes all the way up to $90°$, it is important to recall that $tan(90°) = ∞$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hemmi 153 is marketed as a speciality electrical engineering slide rule. But it would be a crime not to include it in this article, due to its innovative $G_\theta$ scale-based hyperbolic function computations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hemmi 255D Expert Electrical Engineer—As the name suggests the Hemmi 255D is a newer, more advanced electrical engineering log-log vector duplex rule, compared to the older Hemmi 153. But whereas the Hemmi 153 uses the ingenious, but unconventional, $G_\theta$ scale to compute the hyperbolic functions via the trigonometric functions, the Hemmi 255D employs the more direct way to compute hyperbolic functions via the conventional $Sh$ and $Th$ scales. In terms of capabilities, the Hemmi 255D is comparable to other log-log vector duplex rules, like the Pickett N4-ES.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hemmi 255D is definitely a speciality electrical engineering rule. But it is also a general engineering vector slide rule, in the same category as the famous K&amp;amp;E 4083-3. So, I chose to include it in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;K&amp;amp;E 4181-1 Pocket Log Log Duplex Decitrig—The K&amp;amp;E 4181-1 is a miniature version of the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3. But whereas the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 is made of wood, the K&amp;amp;E 4181-1 is made of plastic. And unlike the European plastics, the plastic of this slide rule feels cheap. See the full description in the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 subsection, below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 Log Log Duplex Decitrig—The K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 is the quintessential engineering slide rule. Its design is old and basic, but its implementation good and enduring. In a way, the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 is the Ford Model T of engineering slide rules. It does have a few usability quirks, such as the $LL_1$ and $LL_{01}$ being relegated to the backside. But such compromises are inevitable, given the compactness of this slide rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This slide rule was the most popular slide rule in America. Although it is a very good slide rule, the wood core is easily damaged, when mistreated. And because they were inexpensive, many owners abused them. As such, many K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 slide rules being sold on eBay are warped, and hence are useless. Good ones do pop up every so often; so, be patient. The same admonishment applies to all wood rules, especially the very old ones made in the early 20th century or before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;K&amp;amp;E 68-1100 Deci-Lon 10—The K&amp;amp;E 68-1100 is one of the last, and most refined, engineering slide rules from K&amp;amp;E, designed to compete with late model German slide rules: Aristo 0969, FC 2/83 N, and Nester 0292. And like other newer K&amp;amp;E rules, the K&amp;amp;E 68-1100 is made of plastic that is on the cheap side, compared to the European plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The odd feature of this slide rule is the asymmetric design: the lower frame is very narrow, the slide is quite wide, and the upper frame is unusually wide. The wide upper frame allows all four $LL_{0n}$ scales to fit on the frontside and on the backside all four $LL_n$ scales. This scale layout is much more convenient to use. But to those of us who are used to the common, symmetric design, the lopsided frame feels awkward in the hands. Many collectors admire this advanced engineering rule, but I am no fan of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;K&amp;amp;E 4083-3 Log Log Duplex Vector—Hyperbolic functions are complex domain analogues of real domain trigonometric functions. Whereas trigonometric functions are defined using the unit circle, hyperbolic functions are defined using the hyperbola. Hyperbolic functions are popular with mechanical and civil engineers, who use it to compute the catenary of chains (or, heavy-duty power transmission lines)—the sag that results when hanging a chain of a certain length from two equal-height posts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The length and sag of a chain hung from two posts of equal height is expressed thus:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, $l$ is the length of the chain, $s$ is the sag, $w$ is the weight per unit length, $H$ is the tension at the lowest point, and $2b$ is the distance between the two posts. By the way, the world-famous Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, is a catenary arch, an inverted catenary curve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electrical power engineers use hyperbolic functions to compute impedances (and hence, voltages and currents, by Ohm’s law) on long-distant power transmission lines that stretch several hundred kilometres. Electrical engineers model the impedance of a long transmission line using the $\pi$ model, which represents the long cable as a series connection of short, individual segments, like a long chain made of small, individual links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The K&amp;amp;E 4083-3 vector rule was one of the earliest advanced engineering slide rules with hyperbolic sine $Sh$ and hyperbolic tangent $Th$ scales. Electrical power engineering deals with electric motors, transmission lines, etc., and much of the work in this discipline involves vector calculus. The “vector” designation of the K&amp;amp;E 4083-3 probably traces its origin to electrical power engineers’ obsession with vector calculus and hyperbolic slide rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Catenary of chain and impedance of power line can be computed using the $C$, $D$, $CI$, $DI$, and other arithmetic scales in combination with $Sh$ and $Th$ hyperbolic scales, like those on the backside of the K&amp;amp;E 4083-3 vector rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, since hyperbolic functions are related to exponential functions, an ordinary log-log duplex slide rule, like the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3, can compute hyperbolic functions using the following identities and the $LL$ scales, albeit rather tediously:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the plot below, the blue curve is $sinh$, the green is $cosh$, and the red is $tanh$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logarex 27403-X Darmstadt—The Logarex 27403-X is a late model, simplex Darmstadt, with traditional Darmstadt scales on the frontside and three $LL_n$ scales on the backside of the slide. But whereas a traditional Darmstadt rule has a closed backside and cutouts at each end for reading the $LL_n$ scales, the backside of the Logarex 27403-X is open like a duplex rule and there are no cutouts with red indices. The black indices at each end of the frame permit reading only the $LL_1$ and $LL_3$ scales. But there is no way to read the $LL_2$ scale in the middle of the slide. The only way to use the $LL_n$ scales effectively is to flip the slide round to the front.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flipping the backside of the slide round to the front is a common practice when using older Mannheim and Darmstadt rules. But it amounts to a design blunder on a modern duplex rule like the Logarex 27403-X. Of course, one could use a straight edge of a ruler or a piece of paper as a makeshift index for reading the $LL_2$ scale in the middle of the slide. The overall quality of the Logarex 27403-X is quite horrid: its plastic is about as good as a cheap soap dish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nestler 23 R/3 Rietz—The Nestler 23 R was favoured by very illustrious scientists and engineers, including Albert Einstein, Wernher von Braun, and Sergei Korolev. It is a conventional Rietz rule with a traditional Rietz scale layout. Perhaps it was this simplicity that attracted these greatest scientific minds of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the Nestler 23 R is well loved, there is something subversively quirky about this slide rule. Being of the classic German simplex design, this slide rule is thick enough to have space on the top and bottom edges of the frame for additional scales. The Nestler 23 R has a 27-cm ruler scale on the top edge of the frame and the bottom edge of the frame is either blank or has a $1:25$ scale. The $1:25$ scale is 27.2 cm in length, and is divided linearly into 4-cm divisions. The name for this scale hints at $4 × 25 = 100$ cm, or 1 m. I do not think ruler scales belong on a slide rule; a slide rule is a fine instrument, not a common ruler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nestler 0210 Darmstadt—This slide rule is powerful in a minimalistic sort of way. The backside of the slide has the three $LL_n$ scales typical of Darmstadt rules, which are read through clear-plastic-covered cutouts. And given its classic German simplex proportions, the thick edges sport more scales. The top edge of the frame holds the 27-cm ruler scale and the $L$ scale. The bottom edge of the frame holds the $S$ and $T$ scales. This design is practical, logical, and compact. Of all the Nestler slide rules I own, the Nestler 0210 is my favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nestler 0292 Multimath-Duplex—I like the appearance of Nestler slide rules for their understated elegance. Being a late model advanced log-log duplex engineering rule, the Nestler 0292 possesses the same computing capabilities as the top-of-the-line models from other manufacturers: Aristo 0969, FC 2/83 N, K&amp;amp;E 68-1100, Pickett N3-ES, et al. In my view, the Nester 0292 beats them all in both usability and beauty. No offence intended to those who admire the FC 2/83 N’s looks; indeed, I like that slide rule very well, only not as much as I like the Nestler 0292. Whereas the FC 2/83 N advertises its power, the Nestler 0292 expresses its power quietly. It is appreciably slimmer than the FC 2/83 N, so it feels more comfortable in the hand, especially for those of us who grew up on smaller rules, like the Aristo 0968. And it employs only one background colour, the pale green background, which covers both sides of the slide. I am of the opinion that the Nestler 0292 is an embodiment of the philosophy of engineering: elegant simplicity, effortless efficiency, quiet power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pickett N3-ES Power Log Exponential—The Pickett N3-ES is a late model log-log duplex engineering slide rule. Being constructed of aluminium, it is stabler and tougher than wood rules. Like its competitors, it has eight $LL$ scales. Pickett cleverly stacked the $LL_n$ and $LL_{0n}$ scales on the same line—$LL_0$-$LL_{00}$ stack, $LL_1$-$LL_{01}$ stack, and so on—thus yielding a logical, compact scale layout. But some may argue that stacked scales are more difficult to read. To each his own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I quite like this stacked $LL$ scales layout. But I cannot countenance the economy feel and the impertinent colour of this slide rule. And it is significantly wider and weightier, compared to the late model German log-log duplex rules. In sum, the Pickett N3-ES is cheap and bulky, but stout and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pickett N4-ES Vector Log Log Dual-Based Speed Rule—The Pickett N4-ES is the vectorised version of the Pickett N3-ES. As such, the Pickett N4-ES adds the hyperbolic $Sh$ and $Th$ scales. It is peculiar, though, that this slide rule labels its $LL$ scales from $LL_1$-$LL_{01}$ to $LL_4$-$LL_{04}$, instead of employing the more conventional scheme, which goes from $LL_0$-$LL_{00}$ to $LL_3$-$LL_{03}$. I dislike this slide rule, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Post 1447 Mannheim—The Post 1447 was an honest slide rule fit for innocent high schoolers of the day. It is of the traditional Mannheim simplex design. It has the usual $A$, $B$, $CI$, $C$, $D$, and $K$ scales on the frontside. The $S$, $L$, and $T$ scales are on the backside of the slide, which are read through the clear-plastic-covered cutouts on the backside of the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the day, fortunate middle schoolers and high schoolers learned to use the slide rule on a superb Mannheim rule, like the Post 1447. The cursed, though, had to settle for something vapid, like the Sterling Acumath 400.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Post 1461 Pocket Versalog II—The Post 1461 is a miniature version of the Post 1460. See the full description in the Post 1460 subsection, below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Post 1460 Versalog II—The Post 1460 is a direct competitor, albeit a more refined one, to the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 log-log duplex engineering slide rule. But in my view, the Post 1460 is superior, in terms of appearance, feel, durability, and usability. And it has four black-red pairs of $LL$ scales and the $R_1$-$R_2$ extended $\sqrt{x}$ scales. The Versalog II has a green $cos$ scale, but the original Versalog has a dark blue $cos$ scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My only objection to the design of the Post 1460 is its rather sharp edges. The rounded edges of the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3 feel more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reiss Darmstadt—This slide rule is a traditional Darmstadt rule, but it is made of aluminium. In terms of quality, this slide rule is as good as any European model, and is much better made than the Pickett aluminium rules. But it is quite solid; it weights almost as much as the Pickett N3-ES, despite being much slimmer. Because it is rather slim, the Reiss Darmstadt rule is more comfortable to handle. Still, I dislike its cold, sharp construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reiss 3214 Darmstadt Record—The Reiss 3214 is a late model advanced Darmstadt rule. It feels as solid and smooth as other late model European rules. Its duplex design breaks with the Darmstadt tradition. But in keeping with the Darmstadt tradition, the backside of its slide has three $LL_n$ scales, and the frame is not adjustable. The Reiss 3214 is a decent plastic slide rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Breitling Montbrillant Datora—The Breitling Montbrillant Datora is a member of the Navitimer family of pilot’s watches. The $C$ scale is engraved on the rotating bezel and the $D$ scale is fixed to the watch face. The watch face also has indices for kph to mph conversion and nautical mile to statute mile conversion. As per the Navitimer tradition, this watch incorporates the chronograph function. And it adds the 24-hour sub-dial, and a complete calendar with day, date, and month indicators. The label “Datora” refers to this complete-calendar feature. And the label “Montbrillant” was a historical designation Breitling applied to some of their watch dials during the early 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concise Model 300—The Concise 300 is a low-cost, compact, duplex circular rule. It uses pared-down Darmstadt scales, providing only $LL_2$ and $LL_3$. But it provides two $tan$ scales, $T_1$ and $T_2$. In terms of computing power, this slide rule is as capable as the FC 1/98 except, of course, it does not have the electrical engineering scales. The Concise 300 is held with the $1$ index mark pointing up, and is flipped left-to-right. For its price, this is a decent slide rule. But it does not stack up well against other Japanese-made slide rules, in terms of workmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I purchased this Concise Model 300, new, straight from the Concise online store, many years ago. The quality of this new slide rule seems lower than the older ones I have seen, back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dempster RotaRule Model AA—The Dempster RotaRule was designed and manufactured by John Dempster, a mechanical engineer, for use in engineering. Only about 2,500 units were made between 1928 and 1950, so it is a rare item. A clean, unmarred example like this one is even rarer. The Dempster RotaRule is undoubtedly the most desirable log-log duplex engineering circular rule. The phrase “engineering circular rule” is an oxymoron, given that circular slide rules were a favourite of businessmen and most engineers disliked circular rules. But the Dempster RotaRule is a different kind of circular rule. It has all everything that engineers need: the trigonometric scales, the four $LL_n$ scales, and the Pythagorean $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ scale. At about 13 cm in diameter, this slide rule is about the same size as the simplex FC 8/10. But unlike the FC 8/10’s sedate, single-cycle Rietz scales, the Dempster RotaRule has a 254-cm, quadruple-cycle $LL_n$ scale. And it even has a surveyor’s $Stadia$ scale and a financier’s $Monthly\ Interest$ scale, making it suitable for both technical and business uses. Because the outer portion of the disc (analogue of straight rule’s frame) is fixed and the inner portion (analogue of straight rule’s slide) rotates, the Dempster RotaRule needs only one cursor. And this cursor is well made to the point of being over engineered: it has a sturdy frame equipped with a friction lock, and the central hub has hole to plant a small, brass-framed magnifier that comes with the device. Somewhat unusually, the Dempster RotaRule places the trigonometric scales on the frontside. This slide rule is held with the $1$ index mark pointing down, and is flipped left-to-right. The all-important $LL_n$ scale is on the backside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Dempster RotaRule inspired the Boykin RotaRule Model 510, which is a proper engineering slide rule, with three $LL_n$ scales and three $LL_{0n}$ scales, comparable in capabilities to a top-of-the-line, log-log duplex engineering straight rule, like the K&amp;amp;E 4081-3, only much smaller and with far greater precision. Incidentally, Bernard Boykin, the designer of the fabulous Boykin circular slide rule, was my fellow engineer and a fellow Marylander, to boot. Alas, I do not own a Boykin circular rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FC 8/10—The FC 8/10 is a simplex circular rule with Rietz-equivalent scales. It uses aesthetically pleasing pale yellow and pale green backgrounds for some of the scales. I consider this slide rule one of the prettiest of all engineering tools. I liked the FC 8/10, not only for its beauty, but also because it was well made, accurate, inexpensive, unique, and compact. All the scales are engraved onto the exposed plastic face. The outer portion of the face is fixed to the body, and the rotatable inner portion of the face is operated using both thumbs, pushing against each other. And the cursor with the hairline rotates across the face over the scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an engineering student in the early 1980s Burma, I used this FC 8/10; it was a hand-me-down from my engineer aunt. It was my favourite slide rule, and I used it daily for ordinary tasks. But when I needed the $LL$ scales, say for laboratory work and examinations, I used my other slide rule, the Aristo 0968 log-log duplex straight rule. In general, hopping among different slide rules is considered detrimental, since it robs one the opportunity to develop an intimate relation with a single device. But the FC 8/10 is a unique circular rule: it is just a straight rule in a circular guise. Despite being circular in shape, it operates on the same principles as the Rietz straight rule: the outer portion of the FC 8/10 is analogous to the frame of the straight rule, and the inner portion is analogous to the slide of the straight rule. And the circular shape of the device physically and visually highlights the wrap-around nature of the logarithmic scales. So, my flip-flopping between the FC 8/10 and the 0968 did not impact me, negatively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fowler’s Universal Calculator—At only about 8.5 cm in diameter, the Fowler’s Universal Calculator is perfectly sized for the hand. Etched into the glass cover is the fixed red hairline, aligned to the crown at 12 o’clock. Turning this crown clockwise rotates the face anticlockwise, and turning it anticlockwise rotates the face clockwise. This behaviour may feel weird at first, but it becomes natural with use. All the scales are etched onto this one-piece, rotating face. Turning the crown at 2 o’clock clockwise rotates the clear plastic cursor bearing the black hairline clockwise, and turning it anticlockwise rotates the cursor anticlockwise. The second crown behaves more naturally. It is odd, however, that this slide rule has no $x^2$ $A$ and $B$ scales, yet it has a very long, triple-cycle $\sqrt[3]{x}$ scale. Let us chalk it up to “business logic”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gilson Binary—The Gilson Binary is a cheaply-made, large, thin, aluminium disc of approximately 22 cm in diameter. Given its immense size, it is capable of very high precision calculations. And its two-arm cursor mechanism is quite clever. The frontside has $C$, $CI$, $A$, $K$, $L$, $LL_0$, $LL_1$, $LL_2$, $LL_3$, fraction multiplication and division scale, and millimetre to fractional-inch conversion scale pair. Engineers round the world have always deemed fractions to be annoyances, like a piece of food stuck between the teeth. But to American engineers of yore, fractions were their bread-and-butter. So, the Gilson Binary was a favourite tool of many an American engineer, decades ago. Thankfully, fractions are no longer a thing in American engineering today, although they still dominate factory floors, as do the Imperial measurement system. Depressing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Gilson Binary’s $C$ scale is over 60 cm in length. The range of the entire clockwise, quadruple-cycle $LL_n$ scale is an impressive $[1.0015, 10^6]$. So, chasing the mammoth $LL$ scale round the large face is a daunting task. To ease the pain, the tan-colour face is punctuated with bright yellow scale background rings: the $LL_0$ scale has tan background, the $LL_1$ scale has yellow background, and so on. That helps—somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ingenious part of the Gilson Binary is its two-armed cursor mechanism. The front face of this slide rule has two clear plastic cursors, one longer than the other. When the long cursor is moved, the short cursor also moves in lock step. But the short cursor can be moved independently of the long cursor. Suffice it to say the Gilson Binary’s design is unique. Without the aid of a manual, even experienced straight rule users would be hard pressed to figure out how properly to use it. But once its quirks have been discovered, it is just as simple to use as a straight rule. Note, also, that the Gilson Binary’s two-cursor configuration requires only one logarithmic scale $C$. Hence, there is no need to allocate space for the $D$ scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, computations begin with setting the long cursor hairline on the $1$ on the $C$ scale, and end with reading under the short cursor hairline on the appropriate scale. The short cursor is analogous to the slide of a straight rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $2 × 3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compute $1.03^{2.4}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Gilson Binary is held with the $1$ index mark pointing up, and is flipped left-to-right. As I said above, it is a rather unusual slide rule. The unusual design elements continue on the back face. The backside cursor is a one-arm variety. For instance, unlike a typical slide rule, the Gilson Binary has two opposing $Degree$ scales, one running clockwise and the other anticlockwise. These degree scales are split into three cycles, each spanning $30°$. Stacked atop the degree scales are the clockwise, triple-cycle $T$ scales. The $Degree$-$T$ scale pair is interlaced with the clockwise, triple-cycle $S$ scales. And note that since the $Degree$ scale’s range is $[0°, 90°]$, one must use care to avoid reading a nonsensical value like $tan(90°) = ∞$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;American slide rule manufacturers, like most American engineers of that era, had a hostile attitude toward users in general and toward usability in particular, mistakenly believing that smart, trained people—like engineers—should be able to cope with complexity. This attitude is prominently on display in the design of the Gilson Binary. This slide rule would be far more pleasant to use, had the subtle background colours—green, blue, and yellow, like those found on the FC 8/10—been used, instead of the hypnotic yellow rings. Yes, it is unfair to compare the 1930s Gilson with the 1970s Faber-Castell. But it is eminently fair to compare the American Gilson to its German contemporaries, like the FC 1/54 and the Nestler 23 R. There, too, the Gilson design falls woefully short, in terms of aesthetics and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One more thing. There is a usability quirk common to all circular rules: to bring the upside-down scales into correct, upright orientation, the body of the circular rule must be spun round. This is easy enough for smaller circular rules, like the Dempster RotaRule, the FC 8/10, or the Fowler’s Universal Calculator; one simply spins the holding hand—without shifting the grip—thereby retaining the anchor point on the scale. But for a big circular rule, like the Gilson Binary, it is often necessary to use both hands to spin the rule, thus necessitating shifting of the grip and losing the anchor point on the scale. The long, spiral scales of the Gilson Binary exacerbate this problem. This is where usability-improving features, such as the German rules’ coloured scale backgrounds, could have made the Gilson Binary (and its many imitators) far more user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kontrolpribor Model KL-1—The Kontrolpribor KL-1 is a pocket watch type duplex circular rule. It is about the size of a wristwatch. The front and back faces are covered with cheap plastic. Because the plastic covers are domed, they are prone to scratching. The black-dotted crown at 12 o’clock rotates the face and the red-dotted one at 2 o’clock rotates the needle. The frontside has 15-cm long $C$ and $A$ scales. The backside has circular $C$ and $S$ scales and a spiral $T$ scale. This slide rule is comparable in computing power to a pocket Mannheim straight rule. The Kontrolpribor KL-1 is held with the black-dotted crown pointing up, and is flipped left-to-right. The backside has the $C$ scale, the circular $S\ [5.5°, 90°]$ scale, and the spiral $T\ [1°, 45°]$ scale. This scale layout is quite unique.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to the Fowler’s Universal Calculator, this slide rule is but a cheap toy. Yet, it is much more powerful than the Breitling Navitimer, a very expensive toy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loga 30 Tt—The enviable Swiss craftsmanship is evident in the Loga 30 Tt: accurate, sturdy, elegant. Being a Darmstadt-equivalent model, it is one of the more powerful circular rules. Like other high-end circular rules, the outer portion of the front face is fixed to the frame and the inner portion rotates. The frontside cursor bisects the front face that holds a double-cycle, stacked $\sqrt{x}$ scale and the usual Darmstadt scales. The $\sqrt{x}$ scale is the inverse of the $x^2$ scales ordinarily labelled $A$ and $B$. On this slide rule, though, the $C$ and $D$ scales are confusingly labelled $A$ and $B$. Another quirk of the Loga 30 Tt is that it is intended to be flipped by holding it between the right thumb and forefinger at 3 o’clock. If it were flipped left-to-right, the $1$ index mark would point to the right instead of straight up. The entire back face is fixed to the frame, and holds the $S$, $T$, $ST$, and the three $LL_n$ scales. The end of the backside cursor protrudes beyond the disc. The clever bit is that the back cursor is attached to the inner rotating portion of the front face, and the cursor’s protruding end serves as the handle that rotates the inner front face. A small, rotatable, black disc is mounted to the backside hub. This disc is meant to be used as the handle, when computing with the frontside scales. In terms of capability and quality, the Loga 30 Tt is on par with high-end Darmstadt straight rules, like BRL D.26, FC 1/54, and Nestler 0210. I rather fancy the Loga 30 Tt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pickett 101-C Dial Rule—The Pickett 101-C is a low-end circular rule. The body is a cheap, thin aluminium disc, not unlike the Gilson Binary. Being a rather small disc, there is space for only two $LL_n$ scales. The ranges are notable, though: $LL_1 ∈ [1.15, 4.0]$ and $LL_2 ∈ [4, 10^6]$. And like other low-end, American circular rules of that era, this slide rule has a fraction scale. Indeed, the Pickett 101-C is essentially a miniature version of the Gilson Binary, except for the much shorter $LL_n$ scale. This slide rule is held with the $1$ index mark pointing up, and is flipped bottom-to-top, like a straight rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pickett 111-ES—Unlike other Pickett rules, which are made in America, the Pickett 111-ES is made in Japan. And although it has an aluminium core, the metal edges are rounded off and the faces are covered in high-quality Japanese plastic. It is a pleasant rule to use, despite its eye-gouging yellow. The Pickett 111-ES is held with the $1$ index mark pointing down, and flipped left-to-right. This slide rule is a log-log duplex advanced engineering circular rule with eight $LL$ scales, a rarity among circular rules. In fact, it is more capable than the venerable Dempster RotaRule—a sacrilegious! This slide rule employs Pickett’s stacked layout for the $LL$ scales. But whereas the Pickett N3-ES stacks $LL_n$ and $LL_{0n}$ on the same line, the Pickett 111-ES stacks the adjacent $LL$ scales: the $LL_0$-$LL_1$ stack and the $LL_2$-$LL_3$ stack are on the frontside, and the $LL_{00}$-$LL_{01}$ stack and the $LL_{02}$-$LL_{03}$ stack are on the backside. The backside also holds a double-cycle $S$ scale, a triple-cycle $T$ scale, and a single-cycle $ST$ scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capabilities of the Pickett 111-ES compare well against top-of-the-line engineering straight rules, like Aristo 0969, FC 2/83 N, Nestler 0292, K&amp;amp;E 68-1100, Pickett N3-ES, and others. And similar in design to other high-end circular rules, like the Dempster RotaRule, the outer portion is fixed, the inner portion rotates, and the duplex cursor is firm but glides smoothly. I am no fan of Pickett slide rules, but I really like the Pickett 111-ES.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otis King Model K—Otis King cylindrical slide rules use helical scales. The Model K is unusual in that it uses a double-cycle $C$ scale, thus, can perform chained calculations without the need to reset the cursor, as is necessary with the Model L, described below, which has a normal, single-cycle $C$ scale. But the Model K is limited, capability wise: it could compute only $×$ and $÷$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use the Model K, one holds the chrome handle in one hand and, with the free hand, pulls out the top, thereby exposing the helical logarithmic scales. The black cylinder in the middle, which is operated with the free hand, is the equivalent of the straight rule’s cursor. It is engraved with two white index marks which are aligned to each other. These indices are equivalent of a straight rule’s cursor hairline. The upper cylinder, which holds the $C$ scale can shift up and down along the longitudinal axis, and it can also spin about that axis independently of the fixed $D$ scale on the lower cylinder. The back-facing numbers on the $D$ scale can be brought into view by spinning the chrome handle. And the black cylinder can shift and spin independently of both the upper and the lower scales. So, the Model K’s fixed lower cylinder is equivalent to the frame of the straight rule and the movable upper cylinder is equivalent to the slide of the straight rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otis King Model L—The Model L is identical in construction and operation to the Model K. These two slide rules have a $D$ scale that is almost the same length. But the Model L’s upper cylinder is occupied by the single-cycle $C$ scale and the $L$ scale. The Model L could compute $×$, $÷$, $log$, and $log^{-1}$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have endeavoured to give a thorough enough explanation in this article on how the slide rule works, how it was used, and how it came to be. But this article will not make the reader an expert user of an advanced engineering slide rule; that is the domain of the user’s manuals. I have also emphasised the necessity of engaging the mind, when using a slide rule. And I have demonstrated the extent to which some very simple mathematical functions, like $log$, $ln$, $sin$, $tan$, etc., were put to use to solve substantial problems in engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ingenuity is the ability to make useful things inexpensively on a massive scale by composing simple, but innovative, ideas in reliable, repeatable ways. And that is what engineering is. The slide rule, both as a tool for engineering and as a product of engineering, epitomised this philosophy in its day. The slide rule was born when necessity and ingenuity coincided at a crucial point in history, and it accelerated the technological development of humanity. Over its almost four-century reign, it enabled us to cross the oceans, it empowered us to span the continents, it took us to the Moon. The slide rules deserves remembrance, respect, reverence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Attendance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m in Introduction to Algorithms (577) this semester at UW, and I’ve been enjoying hearing Renault explaining how to prove program correctness, DP, network flow, and the circumstances under which Dijkstra invented his shortest-path algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However… algos is a somewhat unique class for me, given that it’s the first course I’ve taken that mandates being present during lectures by taking attendance. It accomplishes this through a platform called TopHat, who many students will recognize through its use of displaying participation questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TopHat asks you to provide it a four-length numerical code (that’ll be provided to you by your lecturer) in order to verify that you’re actually in the location where the attendance is being taken. You type that code into the student TopHat page, and, bam, you’re marked present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I suppose they caught on to the unpatchable strategy of Having Friends, who, given that they are in the same class section as you, can be sent messages begging for the code from the comfort of your bed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for the paranoid lecturer, TopHat allows “secure attendance”, a feature which, according to them, determines your location as “…determined by [your] device geolocation or by both geolocation and proximity (to the classroom and other students).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time I heard about this system, I wondered how much leeway this “geolocation” would afford you. There exist a plethora of traditional “IP geolocation” services, which use your IP address and ASN — both semi-unique identifiers sent to the webpage upon load — to try and identify your location. This provides… varied results depending on where you’re located. When in Madison and NYC, popular IP geolocation services have been able to pin me within a mile or so of my actual location. In any suburban area, the error jumps to city-level.1 Surely TopHat wouldn’t be relying on such an inaccurate measure of detecting location when determining attendance — students living in Chadbourne Hall taking lectures in Mosse Humanities (approx. 250ft apart) would be able to skirt the attendance requirement. That could be catastrophic!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#The Geolocation API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, it is not IP geolocation being used by TopHat. As aforementioned, IP geolocation is a pretty implicit flow — webpages are able to see your IP when you connect to them. However, when trying to determine your location, TopHat pops up a big scary dialogue past the line of death!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly this is asking something else entirely — something that’s presumably so precise as to require my explicit consent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you the suspense. This is the Geolocation API, a feature of all modern browsers that allows the retrieval of your location to a much more precise degree (hence the permission pop-up). As of writing this post, IP geolocation is enough to place me somewhere in the Lakeshore neighborhood of Madison (1-2 miles long), but Chrome’s Geolocation API is enough to pin me to the exact building — Morgridge Hall — I’m sitting in. That’s orders of magnitude more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first experienced my laptop doing this, my first thought was “How?” There’s nothing special that my laptop has access to that would somehow allow my browser to have a more specific location… right? My laptop doesn’t have a GPS receiver in it2 that would allow location identification in the same way that phones can (and it isn’t just piggybacking off of my phone’s GPS, since this same location API is available on Windows devices).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#It’s all of our faults&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you press “allow” on the popup, your browser uses an accuracy heuristic to determine which method fetches the most accurate location. While this could be GPS (if on a cellular-enabled device) or the aforementioned IP geolocation, it will most likely have the highest success with the Wi-Fi Positioning System, a strategy that uses the wireless access points around you to identify your location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works. After allowing your browser permission to access your location, a website has access to the &lt;code&gt;getCurrentPosition()&lt;/code&gt; function. When calling it, your browser kindly asks your operating system for a list of the surrounding Wi-Fi access points — more specifically, their signal strength, SSIDs, and BSSIDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If those last two are foreign to you, the “SSID” of a network is just the friendly name — for example, &lt;code&gt;UWNet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;eduroam&lt;/code&gt;. The BSSID is the MAC address of the access point, which is unique per each device. Having a unique identifier per access point is immensely important, as you can imagine just how many APs are named the same thing. Take a look at the map of APs around campus named &lt;code&gt;UWNet&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, so, great. We now know exactly which Wi-Fi network you’re connected to. But how does this translate to your location on a map? And how do we even know where these networks are in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Wardriving&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The notion of associating Wi-Fi networks with their physical locations has been prevalent since the early 2000s. As far as I can tell, Skyhook Wireless were the first to do it on a commercially-available scale, using a technique known as wardriving. This entails getting in a vehicle and driving around while capturing the information of as many Wi-Fi networks as possible. Since the devices doing the network scanning also have a reliable knowledge of their position (through GPS), all you have to do is associate the location of where you saw the network with its signal strength. Some RSSI trilateration later, and you have a roughly accurate map of Wi-Fi networks you’ve seen and their corresponding physical locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The useful thing is that, once in possession of all of this data, you can perform the process in reverse — on a user’s device, send a list of the Wi-Fi networks you can see (and their corresponding RSSI), and receive an approximate guess on where that places your device in the world. For a while, that’s what everyone’s devices (including Apple ones, until iOS 3.2) did, relying on either Skyhook’s or Google’s privately collected list. The latter, interestingly enough, used their Street View vehicles (the ones taking images of roads) to capture the Wi-Fi information for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, at some point, companies realized the potential benefit of sourcing this information from the users of their devices. After all, they’re already frequently checking their GPS location and phoning home to cell towers, so why not send some anonymized Wi-Fi location data along with it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, that’s what Apple, Google, and Microsoft devices began doing. The location services of their products, by default, started aggregating the SSIDs and BSSIDs of Wi-Fi hotspots they could see (and their locations) and logging them for others’ devices to use for more accurate location services. And… that’s more or less the same thing that modern devices use today. When Chrome tells me that a website would like to use my location, and I allow it, the list of the surrounding hotspots will be sent to Google — which, because tens of thousands of people with GPS-enabled devices have also pinged the networks, allows my computer to obtain an extremely accurate estimation on where I am. So, thank you, everybody…?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Controversy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you were feeling a little nervous about the idea of your phone aggregating and sharing the location and information of every Wi-Fi network you’ve ever interacted with in your entire life, don’t worry, you’re not alone! There have been plenty of historical incidents with abuses of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with a tough one: remember how earlier (in wardriving) I mentioned that Google historically used their Street View cars to obtain network information for their location services? It turns out that they were sniffing much more than just the headers of the packets — they were aggregating the raw 802.11 Wi-Fi data frames, which includes the non-encrypted payload of HTTP packets. I assume that very little of the internet was using HTTPS in 2010, so the reported 600 gigabytes worth of data they obtained definitely contained some things that users would probably rather them not see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A larger and more pertinent concern tends to crop up with regards to the possibility of tracing someone’s location — which is valid, given its sensitivity. This has been a worry since WPS’ inception, but one older example I found was Elie Bursztein et al.’s talk and accompanying blog post “Using the microsoft geolocalization api to retrace where a windows laptop has been”. At the time, there was a bug where Windows would save a persistent record of every MAC address that you connected to, making it possible to retrace someone’s steps (thus, tracking their location as it changed) using one of numerous location APIs live at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities are even seen in contemporary times — Erik Rye and Dave Levin of the University of Maryland wrote “Surveilling the Masses with Wi-Fi-Based Positioning Systems” in 2024, detailing a flaw in Apple’s location services that allowed them to exfiltrate the positions of nearly two billion BSSIDs by cleverly filtering the MAC address space they were searching. Their paper’s great, and it touches on some real dangers possible from the information in the hands of an adversary, such as stalking individuals by continuously locating their router BSSID, or monitoring population density during wartime by observing the movement of groups of devices (and satellite internet constellations like Starlink).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, the location service providers have improved the security of the APIs they develop. This is supremely important given the risks we’ve discussed, especially given that nearly every device created by these companies are, by default3, sending this information to their manufacturers. Nearly every company that participates in WPS allows you to opt your BSSID out — either by changing the name of your SSID or by specifying the MAC address in a form somewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s instructional opt out page (appending &lt;code&gt;_nomap&lt;/code&gt;) to the SSID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s page, which offers the same advice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s form, requiring a BSSID submission to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I didn’t mention it yet, this technology does have a name. It’s called the Wi-Fi positioning system (WPS). There’s still a vibrant community of Wi-Fi positioning enthusiasts out there — https://wigle.net/ is a crowd-sourced database from recreational wardrivers who have contributed nearly two billion networks over the last 25 years. You can zoom in on your town and see the Wi-Fi density near you, and you can even check if your own network has been tagged by someone else!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention https://beacondb.net/, a self described “public domain wireless geolocation database”, which, while I haven’t had time to play with, sounds like a very promising open version of the trackers so commonly used nowadays. While it doesn’t have as dense of a database as any of the other providers, I actually think it’s neat to have a lack of homogeneity among the smaller providers — it shows the data is truly different!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been really fun diving down this rabbit hole to learn how our devices gain access to our location. It’s one of the more niche things that I’ve taken for granted when using my devices, and it certainly didn’t occur to me that, while in lecture, the only reason I could be marked present was because thousands of other students had (without their knowledge) pinged servers all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This conclusion — “error rates scale based on living settlement density” is my personal conjecture. It is surprisingly frustrating just exactly how little information there is online about how these services attempt to pin your location from just your IP address. Wikipedia has an article about IP geolocation, but it’s vague when discussing the actual implementation details… ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Small digression: did you know that, until May 2000, GPS satellites (which are owned and operated by the United States Space Force) provided the general public a signal with intentional error built into it? This was called Selective Availability, and it augmented the position of GPS readings by about 50 meters (162 feet) horizontally. It was shut off for a number of reasons — one of which being that Differential GPS allows you to circumvent the distortion trivially by comparing the error of the signal against the location of a reference station with a known position. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s associated with “Location Services” on most devices, meaning that you cannot opt out of your phone reporting the locations of surrounding Wi-Fi devices without turning off your phone’s ability to obtain its location entirely. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Act now: continue sending &amp;amp; receiving encrypted messages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April 2026, we will be rolling out a significant update to strengthen the security of your conversations: unverified devices will no longer be able to send and receive end-to-end encrypted messages via Element. This change follows the Matrix specification update that was announced at the Matrix 2025 conference on October, 17 and benefits everyone by enhancing security, but may require an action from you to continue sending &amp;amp; receiving encrypted messages on your existing devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This security update will give you assurance that when you receive a message from a contact, you can effortlessly assume it’s really from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a big step towards making Element an even more safe and reliable messaging experience. We mean it when we say that we want to provide the most secure communication technology in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here’s what’s changing and why it matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unverified devices are a potential attack vector&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re messaging a colleague and suddenly a warning shield icon appears on your screen. Is this just a harmless unverified device and you can safely ignore the warning, or has someone’s account been compromised? At best this is a distraction and, at worst, it is someone malicious trying to impersonate one of your contacts - neither is ideal. What’s worse is that ignoring these warnings leaves unmitigated risks to proliferate throughout your network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Element, trust is critical - a non-negotiable. For example, we provide end-to-end encryption by default to all of our users to ensure that you and the person you're messaging - and only the person you're messaging - can read the messages. This forthcoming change aims to eliminate uncertainty and the likelihood of malicious activity by requiring all devices to be verified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Device verification matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Device verification acts like a hand shake between your devices, proving cryptographically to your contacts that they belong to you. Without this verification step, messages sent from your new devices must be marked as untrusted in your conversations. By making verification mandatory, users can be confident in every message sent and received via Element and are not distracted by warnings about insecure devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Trust by design and default&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going forward devices will be either verified or unable to participate in conversations - it’s that simple. No more warning or shield icons that can be easily ignored, these ultimately undermine the impact of important warnings/notifications (users become desensitised).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By verifying your devices, you’re not just protecting your own communications, you’re creating a more trusted environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re designing a system that prioritises the security of your communications and making verification an integral part of the process is a great example of that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Action required by end users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re already in the habit of verifying your devices and have your recovery key set up there’s nothing you need to do to prepare, you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For everyone else, now is the time to take action:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check if your existing devices - mobile, web or desktop - are verified.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set up recovery if you haven’t done that already.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: although setting up recovery is strictly not mandatory, it is highly recommended, as it simplifies the verification of new devices, and enables you to do that even when you lose all of your current devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the details of how to do this on various platforms, please read more in the user documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What if you don’t verify…?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From April 2026:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unverified devices will no longer be able to send messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Content of the messages received from unverified devices will not be shown (you can still see that there was a message).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, unverified devices will effectively become unusable in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) conversations. You’ll still be able to participate in conversations where E2EE has been deactivated, but in all other circumstances you will be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building trust together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As stated above, trust is fundamental to secure communication. By requiring verified devices, we are raising the bar for what users can expect from your secure communication. This is a small change that makes a big difference. We have to work together with our users to ensure success. We’re doing this work to ensure every message you send and receive is as trustworthy as a face-to-face conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re here to make the transition as smooth as possible. If you have questions or need help, our support team is ready to assist. Together, let’s make digital communication as secure as possible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; magic, details about the shebang/hash-bang mechanism
on various Unix flavours&lt;p&gt;2001-08-13 .. 2021-10-20 (see recent changes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you'll find&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See an old mail from Dennis Ritchie introducing the new feature, quoted in 4.0 BSD /usr/src/sys/newsys/sys1.c. &lt;lb/&gt; The path component &lt;code&gt;newsys&lt;/code&gt; was an option.
	&lt;lb/&gt;It is also mentioned in /usr/src/sys/sys/TODO (that is, in the regular path), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;6. Exec fixes Implement dmr's #! feature; pass string arguments through faster.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; mechanism origins from Bell Labs, between Version 7 and Version 8,
	&lt;lb/&gt; and was then available on 4.0BSD (~10/'80), although not activated per default. &lt;lb/&gt; Two important differences to current implementations are: &lt;lb/&gt;The length of the line was limited to 16 (Research Unix) or 32 (BSD) bytes. &lt;lb/&gt;"Arguments" were not delivered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was then implemented by default on 4.2BSD (~09/'83), /usr/src/sys/sys/kern_exec.c by Robert Elz. &lt;lb/&gt; This implementation delivered all #! arguments as a single one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less than a year after 4.0BSD, but more than two years before 4.2 BSD, &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was also added to
	2.8BSD (~07/'81), but not active by default.
	&lt;lb/&gt; 2.x BSD is a different development line, independent from 4 BSD. It's a 7th edition (V7) kernel with fixes activated by macros. &lt;lb/&gt; The macro for the &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; code is not present in a makefile, so you had to activate it yourself.
	The code wording is slightly different from 4 BSD.
	&lt;lb/&gt; On 2.8 BSD, &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; seems to come from the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, not from Berkeley.

       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to Gunnar Ritter for pointing out the origins in 4.0 and 4.2BSD in de.comp.os.unix.shell, to Jeremy C. Reed for mentioning Robert Elz, and to Richard Kettlewell for spotting 2.8BSD on TUHS mailing list.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 4.3BSD Net/2 the code was removed due to the license war and had to be reimplemented for the descendants (e.g., NetBSD, 386BSD, BSDI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Version 8 (aka 8th edition), &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; is implemented in
	&lt;code&gt;/usr/sys/sys/sys1.c&lt;/code&gt;
	and documented in &lt;code&gt;exec(2)&lt;/code&gt;.

	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the public releases from Bell Labs, &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was not added until SVR4 ('88) according to a 
	TUHS list discussion.
	System III and SVR1 definitely had not implemented it, yet.

	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dennis M. Ritchie (email answer to Alex North-Keys) he got the idea from elsewhere, perhaps from one of the UCB conferences on BSD. And it seems &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; had no name originally.

	&lt;lb/&gt;Doug McIllroy mentions in the TUHS mailing list, that the slang for &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; was "sharp" at the time at Bell Labs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paragraph "3.16) Why do some scripts start with #! ... ?" (local copy), &lt;lb/&gt; emphasizes the history concerning shells, not the kernel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That document is incorrect about two details (and it seems not to be actively maintained at the moment):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was not invented at Berkeley (but they implemented
	it first in widely distributed releases), see above.
	&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; csh-hack: the document explicitly states that only csh was modified
	on the BSDs.&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; required? 

	&lt;p&gt; There is a rumor, that a very few and very special, earlier Unix versions (particularly 4.2BSD derivatives) require you to separate the "&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;" from the following path with a blank.
        &lt;lb/&gt;You may also read, that (allegedly) such a kernel parses "&lt;code&gt;#! /&lt;/code&gt;" as a 32-bit (long) magic.

        But it turns out that it is virtually impossible to find
	a Unix which actually required this.

        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4.2BSD in fact doesn't require it, although previous versions of the GNU autoconf tutorial claimed this ("10. Portable Shell Programming", corrected with release 2.64, 2009-07-26). &lt;lb/&gt; But instead, see 4.2BSD, /usr/src/sys/sys/kern_exec.c (the first regular occurence). A blank is accepted but not required. &lt;lb/&gt;All this pointed out by Gunnar Ritter in &amp;lt;3B5B0BA4.XY112IX2@bigfoot.de&amp;gt; (and thanks to the new Caldera license, the code can be cited here now.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, the origin of this myth "of the required blank" might be a particular release of 4.1 BSD: There is a manpage in a "4.1.snap" snapshot of 4.1BSD &lt;lb/&gt;on the CSRG CDs, /usr/man/man2/exec.2 (4/1/81), where a space/tab after the &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; is mentioned as mandatory.
	However, this is not true: the source itself remained unchanged.
        &lt;lb/&gt;(Hint to the existence of such a manpage from Bruce Barnett in &amp;lt;ae3m9l$rti$0@208.20.133.66&amp;gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear whether this is a bug or confusion in documentation or if Berkeley planned to modify the BSD source but eventually did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DYNIX is mentioned in the autoconf documentation, too. It's unclear if this variant might have implemented it in a few releases &lt;lb/&gt;(perhaps following the abovementioned manual page). At least Dynix 3.2.0 or Dynix PTS 1.2.0 were actually 4.2 BSD derived and did not require the blank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I asked David MacKenzie, the author of the autoconf documentation, about the actual origin of the autoconf note. &lt;lb/&gt; But unfortunately neither the reporting author nor the very system are recorded anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even intensive search of usenet archives didn't reveal any further hints to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found no evidence yet, that there's an implementation which forbids a blank after &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;

   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4.4BSD, however, didn't support setuid scripts, yet. The UNIX FAQ claims this (4.7. "How can I get setuid shell scripts to work?"), &lt;lb/&gt;but it's explicitly denied in kern_exec.c. setuid for scripts had been disabled with 4.3BSD-Tahoe already. &lt;lb/&gt;And the successor to 4.4BSD, 4.4BSD-Lite lost its &lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt;
	     implementation due to the license war.
	&lt;lb/&gt; Instead, a very early NetBSD release seems to be the origin concerning free BSDs 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[1]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; NetBSD already implements it in the first cvs entry for &lt;code&gt;exec_script.c&lt;/code&gt;
	    (1994/01/16), some time before release 1.0.
	    &lt;p&gt;Earlier code has been removed from netbsd.org. The filedescriptor filesystem ("fdescfs") had been added with release 0.8 (04/93).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NetBSD was influenced by 386BSD, but I couldn't find it there (including patchkit 0.2.4, 06/93).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD, which is a direct descendant of 386BSD, doesn't implement it either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenBSD forked off from NetBSD later (10/95) and thus implements it like NetBSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Steven aka Neozeed meanwhile provides NetBSD 0.8 and 0.9 via cvsweb (announcement) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set user id support is implemented by means of the fd filesystem for instance on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SETUIDSCRIPTS&lt;/code&gt; activated)
	&lt;code&gt;SETUIDSCRIPTS&lt;/code&gt; activated)
	&lt;code&gt;kern.sugid_scripts&lt;/code&gt;.
	&lt;p&gt;Set user id support is also implemented on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; mechanism),
	&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; interpreter file is used.
	&lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt;.  Without this flag, the EUID is set back
		to the UID if different.
		&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; mechanism,
	     because you have to be aware of numerous issues.
	    &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; script 

    &lt;p&gt; or: can you nest &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;?

    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most probably there isn't any Bell-Labs- or Berkeley-derived Unix that accepts the interpreter to be a script, which starts with &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; again.

    &lt;lb/&gt;However, Linux since 2.6.27.9 2 and Minix accept this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to confuse whether the kernel accepts it, or if the kernel has returned with an &lt;code&gt;ENOEXEC&lt;/code&gt;
	&lt;lb/&gt;and your shell silently tries to take over, parsing the &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; becomes the invoked script.)
    &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; mechanism was not present at compile time
	 (probably only in unix-like environments like cygwin).
    &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;, but only if "BSD" was not defined at compile time.
     Later variants de-facto do not recognize it.
    &lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[2]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; For more information about nested &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; on Linux, see the
	kernel patch [if link dead, then try this page, archive.org]
	&lt;p&gt;(patch to be applied to 2.6.27.9) and especially see binfmt_script.c which contains the important parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux allows at most&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BINPRM_MAX_RECURSION&lt;/code&gt;, that is 4, levels of nesting.
	&lt;p&gt;(hint to me about the change by Mantas Mikulėnas.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very few systems deliver only the first argument, some systems split up the arguments like a shell to fill up &lt;code&gt;argv[]&lt;/code&gt;,
	&lt;lb/&gt; most systems deliver all arguments as a single string. See the table below. I noticed that for Linux (delivering all arguments as one string), &lt;lb/&gt; a patch to split up was suggested on the Linux kernel mailing list (if link dead, then try this page, archive.org), followed by a discussion of some portability issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;env(1)&lt;/code&gt; is often used with the &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; mechanism to start
	an interpreter, which then only needs to be somewhere
	in your PATH, e.g. "&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl&lt;/code&gt;".

	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the location of &lt;code&gt;env(1)&lt;/code&gt; might vary.
	Free-, Net-, OpenBSD and some Linux distributions (e.g. Debian)
	only come with /usr/bin/env.
	&lt;lb/&gt;On the other hand, there's only /bin/env at least on SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 and Cray Unicos 9.0.2 (although the latter is only of historical interest). &lt;lb/&gt;On some other Linux distributions (Redhat) it's located in /bin and /usr/bin/ contains a symbolic link pointing to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The env-mechanism is highly increasing convenience, and almost all systems nowadays provide /usr/bin/env. Yet, it cannot strictly assure "portability" of a script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, env should not be a script. See "can you nest #!" above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD 4.0 introduced a comment-like handling of "#" in the arguments, &lt;lb/&gt;but release 6.0 revoked this (see also a discussion on freebsd-arch). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacOS X introduced comment-like handling of "#" with release 10.3(/xnu-517/Panther)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line: 
    &lt;code&gt;sizeof(struct a.out)&lt;/code&gt;" or "&lt;code&gt;sizeof(struct exec)&lt;/code&gt;".
	&lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;, which contains both this struct
	a.out (or exec) and a string of the same size which will contain the &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line.
        &lt;code&gt;kern_execve.v&lt;/code&gt;
	(in the Attic), which
	inherited
	from 386BSD-0.1 patch 0.2.2, and soon
	added
	allowing one argument.
	&lt;code&gt;kern/exec_script.c&lt;/code&gt;
	(&lt;code&gt;MAXINTERP&lt;/code&gt; in
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/param.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or
	&lt;code&gt;PATH_MAX&lt;/code&gt; in
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/syslimits.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,
	respectively).

        &lt;code&gt;imgact_shell.c&lt;/code&gt;
	and 
        &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/imgact.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;machine/param.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
	(i386,
	ia64,
	sparc64,
	amd64,
	alpha:
	param.h and
	alpha_cpu.h,
	supported until 6.3) ,
	and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/param.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
	&lt;code&gt;MAXSHELLCMDLEN&lt;/code&gt; now is set to &lt;code&gt;PAGESIZE&lt;/code&gt;, which in turn depends on the architecture.

        &lt;code&gt;kern/exec_script.c&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;MAXINTERP&lt;/code&gt; in
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/param.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

	&lt;code&gt;BINPRM_BUF_SIZE&lt;/code&gt; in
	&lt;code&gt;load_script()&lt;/code&gt; in
	&lt;code&gt;linux/fs/binfmt_script.c&lt;/code&gt;,
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;linux/binfmts.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;uapi/linux/binfmts.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).
	


	&lt;p&gt; On Linux, &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was introduced with kernel release 0.09 or 0.10
	(0.08 had not implemented it, yet).
	&lt;lb/&gt;And in fact, the original maximum length was 1022, see &lt;code&gt;linux/fs/exec.c&lt;/code&gt; from Linux 0.10.
	&lt;lb/&gt;But with Linux 0.12, this was changed to 127 (parts of a diff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;limits.h&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;syslimits.h&lt;/code&gt;
	on the respective system.

	&lt;p&gt;Exceptions are BIG-IP4.2 (BSD/OS4.1) with 4096 and FreeBSD since 6.0 (PAGE_SIZE) with 4096 or 8192 depending on the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Minix also uses the limit of &lt;code&gt;PATH_MAX&lt;/code&gt; characters
	(255 here) but the actual limit is 257 characters,
	&lt;lb/&gt;because &lt;code&gt;patch_stack()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;src/mm/exec.c&lt;/code&gt;
	first skips the "&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;" with an &lt;code&gt;lseek()&lt;/code&gt; and then reads in the rest.

	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; magic with a multi character constant
	&lt;code&gt;	 #define SCRMAG '#!'&lt;/code&gt;

	&lt;code&gt;SCRMAG&lt;/code&gt;,
	and even added its own multi character constant for a variant of the magic:
	&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;# define SCRMAG2 '/*#!'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;# define ARGPLACE "$*"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find more information about this in the end notes [Demos].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sys/i386/i386/exec_machdep.c&lt;/code&gt;) shows an interesting way to construct the magic
	&lt;quote&gt;[...] switch (magic) { /* interpreters (note byte order dependency) */ case '#' | '!' &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8: handler = exec_interpreter; break; case [...]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; only as a possible extension:

    &lt;quote&gt;Shell Introduction [...] If the first line of a file of shell commands starts with the characters #!, the results are unspecified. The construct #! is reserved for implementations wishing to provide that extension. A portable application cannot use #! as the first line of a shell script; it might not be interpreted as a comment. [...] Command Search and Execution [...] This description requires that the shell can execute shell scripts directly, even if the underlying system does not support the common #! interpreter convention. That is, if file foo contains shell commands and is executable, the following will execute foo: ./foo&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a Working Group Resolution trying to define the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, speaking about "&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;" on any Unix:
    &lt;lb/&gt; This is a really rocksolid and portable convention by tradition, if you expect anything from the Bourne shell family and its descendants to be called. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was a great hack to make scripts look and feel like real executable binaries.
	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, as a little summary, what's special about &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;? (list mostly courtesy of David Korn)
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; is much smaller than the maximum path length
	&lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; is not searched for the interpreter
 	&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line also accepts a relative path,
	&lt;code&gt;#!interpreter&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;#!./interpreter&lt;/code&gt;,
	&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; script again
	&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line itself is varying
	&lt;code&gt;#!$SHELL&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ENOENT&lt;/code&gt;.
	&lt;p&gt;This error can be misleading, because many shells then print the script name instead of the interpreter in its &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line:
	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;$cat script.sh #!/bin/notexistent $ ./script.sh ./script.sh: not foundbash since release 3 subsequently itself reads the first line and gives a diagnostic concerning the interpreter&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;bash: ./script.sh: /bin/notexistent: bad interpreter: No such file or directory&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line is too long, at least three things can happen:
	&lt;code&gt;E2BIG&lt;/code&gt;
	    (IRIX, SCO OpenServer)
	    or &lt;code&gt;ENAMETOOLONG&lt;/code&gt;
	    (FreeBSD, BIG-IP4.2, BSD/OS4.1)
	    &lt;code&gt;ENOEXEC&lt;/code&gt;.
		In some shells this results in a silent failure.
		&lt;p&gt;I used the following as program "showargs":&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; int main(argc, argv) int argc; char** argv; { int i; for (i=0; i&amp;lt;argc; i++) fprintf(stdout, "argv[%d]: \"%s\"\n", i, argv[i]); return(0); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;and a one line script named "invoker.sh" to call it, similar to this,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;#!/tmp/showargs -1 -2 -3&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;to produce the following results (tried them myself, but I'd like to add your results from yet different systems).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, a result from the above would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;argv[0]: "/tmp/showargs" argv[1]: "-1 -2 -3" argv[2]: "./invoker.sh"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... but the following table lists the variations.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[orig]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; 4.0BSD and 386BSD-0.1 don't hand over any argument at all. &lt;p&gt;The called interpreter only receives argv[0] with it's own path, argv[1] with the script, and optionally further arguments from the call of the script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[43bsd]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; The code in kern_exec.c tests if the byte after the struct containing the #! line is null. Otherwise it throws an ENOEXEC. &lt;p&gt;However, reading the line from the file is also limited to 32 bytes, and the following byte (not from the file)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;is often zeroed out by coincidence. It then looks as if the line was cut to 32 bytes. But sometimes, you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;actually get an ENOEXEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[netbsd0.9]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; If the line is longer than 32 bytes, it triggers a bug: the scriptname is appended to argv[1] and argv[2] contains an environment variable. &lt;p&gt;setuid support is a compile time option, however not per Makefile but by activating it in kern_exec.c itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[big-ip]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; This BIG-IP 4.2 (vendor is F5) is based on BSDi BSD/OS 4.1, probably even with very few modifications: &lt;p&gt;The tools contain the string "BSD/OS 4.1" and there's also a kernel /bsd-generic, which contains "BSDi BSD/OS 4.1".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had no compiler available on this system, thus some tests are pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[sco]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; John H. DuBois told me that &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was introduced in SCO UNIX 3.2v4.0, but was disabled by default.
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to use it, it had to be enabled by setting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hashplingenable&lt;/code&gt;
in kernel/space.c ("hashpling" because 
&lt;p&gt;it was implemented by programmers in Britain). It was apparently enabled by default in 3.2v4.2, but even then there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;were no&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; scripts shipped with the OS as a customer might disable it.
The first &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; scripts (tcl) were shipped in 3.2v5.0 then.

&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[early-linux]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; On linux 0.10 until 0.99.1, &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; contains both the interpreter and the arguments:
     &lt;code&gt;argv[0]: "/tmp/showargs -1 -2 -3"&lt;/code&gt;


&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[hurd]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; Nesting interpreters this way: &lt;quote&gt;$ ./script2 -2 script2: #!/path/script1 -1 script1: #!/path/showargs -0results in&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;argv[0]: "/path/showargs" argv[1]: "-0" argv[2]: "/path/script1" argv[3]: "-1" argv[4]: "./script2" argv[5]: "-2"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[uwin]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; An example for a valid absolute interpreter path is &lt;code&gt;C:/path/to/interpreter&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A path with backslashes or without the drive letter is not accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home of the UWIN package at AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[cygwin]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; Valid absolute interpreter paths are for example &lt;code&gt;C:/path/to/interpreter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/path/to/interpreter&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backslashes are not accepted. Nested script are only possible if a drive letter is used&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; becomes a path in windows notation &lt;code&gt;C:\path\to\interpreter&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt; nested &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; cygwin.com: Web-Git (formerly Web-CVS) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On cygwin-1.7.55 the call even can succeed with values greater than 65536, but only occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[Demos]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; DEMOS / ДЕМОС was a Soviet variant of 2.9BSD (PDP-11 version), or 4.2 BSD (32bit VAX-version), respectively. &lt;p&gt;See also the Wikipedia entry and gunkies.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demos recognizes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;#!CMD A1 $* A2 A3&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demos also knows an alternative magic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;/*#!for interpreters which use&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; as comment instead of &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Random821 for pointing out this special implementation on the THUS list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;And why shebang? In music, '#' means sharp. So just shorten &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; to sharp-bang.  Or it might be derived from "shell
bang".  All this probably under the influence of the american slang
idiom "the whole shebang" (everything, the works, everything
involved in what is under consideration).  

See also the 
wiktionary,
jargon
dictionary
or Merriam-Websters.

Sometimes it's also called hash-bang, pound-bang,
sha-bang/shabang, hash-exclam, or hash-pling
(british, isn't it?).

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dennis M. Ritchie (email answer to Alex North-Keys) it seems it had no name originally. &lt;lb/&gt;And Doug McIllroy mentioned in the TUHS mailing list, that the slang for &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; at Bell Labs most probably was "sharp" at the time.

    &lt;p&gt;Textile made of natural stone? Yes, it is possible!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First the basalt is melted at a temperature of 1,400 °C (2550 °F). The molten rock is then extruded through small nozzles for the production of filaments of basalt fibers. The high modulus of elasticity of the product results in an excellent tensile strength, which is more than twice the tensile strength of steel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basalt Woven Textile has high corrosive and chemical resistance to the influence of a corrosive media: salt solutions, acid solutions and particularly alkali liquids. The specific strength of basalt fiber exceeds the strength of alloyed steel by a factor of 2,5 and the strength of glass fiber by a factor of 1,5. Heat-insulating items made from basalt fiber combined with inorganic binding agents may be used by temperatures up to 700°С. In addition there is a range of compositions consisting of basalt rocks that have a higher thermal stability – up to 800°С.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basalt fibers also have high electric-insulating characteristics and transparency for electromagnetic radiation. These properties allow basalt fiber to be used for production of electric insulating materials for low-voltage (up to 250 V) and high-voltage (500 V) equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Laptop Displays&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page provides details on the various laptop display technologies used with DOS laptop, portable and luggable computers. It should be read in conjunction with the Graphics Cards page as well as my CRT Monitors page for completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days we take it for granted that our modern laptops have colour high-resolution screens. Back when manufacturers were trying to make the IBM PC or compatible more transportable and lightweight, installing a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) miniature monitor into a case made it preventatively heavy. CRTs were relatively cheap despite their weight, so it was an obvious choice to use tiny CRTs in their luggable machines. The first portable PCs - the Compaq Portable range - also used a CRT and IBM themselves used one in their first potable, the IBM Portable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After only a handful of these heavyweights, the PC market turned to Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) technology, and whilst it was hugely expensive to make large LCD screens, as popularity of mobile computing grew prices fell, and so the use of LCDs more or less stuck throughout the DOS era in one guise or another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LCD technology was another that first arose in the 1960s. It was tremendously energy-efficient, and required very little space so it suited mobile devices well. Since LCDs don't produce any light themselves (unlike gas plasma), they really needed what was to be called a backlight (literally, a light shining from the back of the screen) to really make the screen more readable. Backlit LCD displays really didn't start to appear until 1988 - before then your laptop computer's LCD display was like a large calculator screen using nothing more than a reflective layer behind the liquid crystals to reflect ambient light! There was also the concept of 'sidelit' displays where rather than shining a light from behind the screen, the display would have a light on each side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even with a backlight, LCD displays have poor contrast and a slow refresh rate, which would produce a "ghosting" effect whenever the displayed content was scrolling or moving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The Toshiba T1100 with its monochrome LCD display (1985)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gas Plasma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gas plasma displays were first used in the 1960s. In a gas plasma display, each pixel is illuminated by a tiny bit of plasma (charged gas). Gas plasma displays are thinner than CRTs due to there being no need for an electron gun at a certain distance from the back of the screen, and are much brighter than LCD displays. The gases used in a gas plasma display are neon and xenon, both inert, and these are sandwiched in between two plates that have been coated in a conductive print - one of which contains vertical lines, and the other, horizontal lines. So together they form a grid. When electric current is passed through the conductive prints on these two plates the gas at the point they meet glows, which is seen by the user as a single pixel lighting up. Despite being particularly bright and produce a nice sharp image, gas plasma displays use a lot of power, making them pretty unsuitable for portable computing, but it made a comeback with flat-panel TVs many years later!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The orange gas plasma display from a Toshiba T3200SX (1989)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Supertwist Nematic (STN) Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invented in 1983, the STN is a type of monochrome passive-matrix LCD display. The "passive" in the wording here means that each pixel must maintain its state (off or on) without active driving circuitry until it can be refreshed again. In a Twisted Nematic (TN) display the liquid crystal molecules have an electric field applied to them to realign the molecules to either be off (twisted 90 degrees, electric field off), or on (untwisted, electric field on). Sadly due to limitations/thresholds of passive-matrix addressing, TN displays could only be so large. In a supertwist nematic display, the molecules are twisted 180 to 270 degrees which allowed for more rows and columns, hence higher resolution displays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All STN displays were monochrome until NEC launched the first colour laptop, the ProSpeed CSX, in October 1989. Several other laptop manufacturers had been working on colour screen technology at the same time, so 1990 saw many more colour laptops arrive on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One advantage of STN displays is that they require no backlight - they are still readable under direct sunlight with a reflective layer behind the display. Unfortunately, because they are still passive matrix, the ghosting effect seen with LCD monochrome displays is still present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The Compaq LTE Elite 4/40C with a colour STN display&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Double Layer Supertwist Nematic (DSTN) Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To overcome the slow refresh rate of STN screens, DSTN technology splits the screen into two halves, where each half is simultaneously refreshed, giving a much faster overall refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, DSTN still suffers from the same inherent problems of any passive-matrix display, like low contrast (typically a DSTN display has a contrast ratio of 15:1 compared to TFT displays which are 40:1 or better), and washed-out colours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The Toshiba Satellite Pro 400CDS with its colour DSTN display&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Thin Film Transistor (TFT) Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TFT, also called "active-matrix" displays arrived around mid-1992, and were available in both monochrome and colour, though most laptop manufacturers had stopped selling monochrome TFT laptops by 1994 as prices of the colour displays dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TFT displays work on the basis of each individual pixel being switched on or off by up to four transistors. The "active" in the name is because each pixel also has a capacitor that actively maintains the pixel state. Whilst much more expensive than STN/DSTN displays, they overcome all the problems of a passive-matrix display. They have a much higher contrast ratio and a fast refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; A Compaq LTE 5200 from 1996 with its colour TFT display&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early TFT displays had a maximum display resolution of 640 x 480 - if you wanted to run Windows in a higher resolution you could do so by attaching an external monitor to the laptop. By 1996 the SVGA resolution of 800 x 600 was becoming more commonplace for TFT laptops, and top-end ones even supported 1,024 x 768.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TFT technology is still widely used on modern-day laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;40 years ago, Calvin and Hobbes' raucous adventures burst onto the comics page&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;40 years ago — on November 18, 1985 — a new comic strip appeared in the newspaper: Calvin and Hobbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hobbes was a stuffed tiger, but in the mind of 6-year-old Calvin he was a wryly observant companion for his day-to-day challenges and wildly imaginative adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adventures of the beloved duo lasted just a decade. Their creator — cartoonist Bill Watterson — walked away from Calvin and Hobbes at the height of its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watterson — who has given few interviews — seamlessly combined the silly, the fantastic and the profound in his strip. That slightly demented quality captured editor Lee Salem, who spoke with NPR's Renee Montagne in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interview highlights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lee Salem: I remember it when I first read it, and it all... it literally took my breath away. And I circulated it in the office, and the response was immediate. It was fresh, it was funny, the art was strong, and here's this archetypal little boy living a life that some of us lived or wanted to live or remembered living. ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the single favorites that I have is actually on my wall in the office, and it shows Calvin in bed, obviously with a fever or something. He's got a thermometer in his mouth. You hear the words from a television. He's watching a soap opera — you know, "If you leave your spouse and I'll leave mine and we can get married." And it goes on and on and on, as lurid soap operas sometimes do. And Calvin turns to the reader with a big grin on his face, and he says, "Sometimes, I learn more when I stay home from school than when I go." And I just thought that was so funny. And, amazingly, when it ran, we actually got complaints from readers who said, "Well, you know, you're advocating that children stay home and watch adult soap operas." And somehow, the whole sense of irony was lost in that, but I don't think it was lost on me. I love that strip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Renee Montagne: You know, I describe him as a little boy with his tiger friend, but there's so much more to it than that. So there's one where they're sitting philosophizing, as they often do, on the grass, this time under a tree. Hobbes is looking at the sky and saying, "Do you think there's a god?" And they're both gazing and thinking, and then in the fourth panel, Calvin thinks about it. And then do you remember what he says?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: Yeah. "Yeah, well, someone is out to get me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montagne: Calvin was preceded into existence by some pretty famous little boys: Charlie Brown, Dennis the Menace. What made him different?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: You know, we saw Calvin living in a world he never made, populated by adults and teachers, and he was trying to deal with that and accomplish what he could. I think Calvin has a bit more perhaps Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in him than Charlie Brown. Hobbes I see almost as the alter ego of Calvin. He's a balancing act that allows Calvin to exist. He provides commentary on some of Calvin's crazy adventures and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montagne: Hobbes goes from being a stuffed tiger when there's any other person in the room, to the real Hobbes we know and love. Is Hobbes real or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: He is to me, and obviously he is to Calvin. Whether he is to the other characters or not is an open question. But I think one of the things Bill brought to the art board was this wonderful ability to take a child's imagination and fantasy life and make it real. It really is irrelevant whether Hobbes has an existence as we would define it. For Calvin, he is there. He's a buddy, he's a companion, he's a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lee Salem edited Calvin and Hobbes until the comic strip ended in 1995. Creator Bill Watterson said at the time that he wanted to explore a canvas beyond the four panels of a daily newspaper, and to work at what he called "a more thoughtful pace," but has produced little public work since then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem died in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Students at the University of Staffordshire have said they feel “robbed of knowledge and enjoyment” after a course they hoped would launch their digital careers turned out to be taught in large part by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;James and Owen were among 41 students who took a coding module at Staffordshire last year, hoping to change careers through a government-funded apprenticeship programme designed to help them become cybersecurity experts or software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after a term of AI-generated slides being read, at times, by an AI voiceover, James said he had lost faith in the programme and the people running it, worrying he had “used up two years” of his life on a course that had been done “in the cheapest way possible”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If we handed in stuff that was AI-generated, we would be kicked out of the uni, but we’re being taught by an AI,” said James during a confrontation with his lecturer recorded as a part of the course in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;James and other students confronted university officials multiple times about the AI materials. But the university appears to still be using AI-generated materials to teach the course. This year, the university uploaded a policy statement to the course website appearing to justify the use of AI, laying out “a framework for academic professionals leveraging AI automation” in scholarly work and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The university’s public-facing policies limit students’ use of AI, saying students who outsource work to AI or pass off AI-generated work as their own are breaching its integrity policy and may be challenged for academic misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m midway through my life, my career,” James said. “I don’t feel like I can now just go away and do another career restart. I’m stuck with this course.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Staffordshire case comes as more and more universities use AI tools – to teach students, generate course materials and give personalised feedback. A Department of Education policy paper released in August hailed this development, saying generative AI “has the power to transform education”. A survey last year (pdf) of 3,287 higher education teaching staff by the educational technology firm Jisc found that nearly a quarter were using AI tools in their teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For students, AI teaching appears to be less transformative than it is demoralising. In the US, students post negative online reviews about professors who use AI. In the UK, undergraduates have taken to Reddit to complain about their lecturers copying and pasting feedback from ChatGPT or using AI-generated images in courses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I understand the pressures on lecturers right now that may force them to use AI, it just feels disheartening,” one student wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;James and Owen said they noticed the use of AI in their Staffordshire course “almost immediately” last year when, during their first class, the lecturer put on a PowerPoint presentation that included an AI version of his voice reading off the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon after, they said, they noticed other signs that some course materials were AI-generated, including American English inconsistently edited to British English, suspicious file names, as well as “generic, surface-level information” that occasionally referred inexplicably to US legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signs of AI-generated material continued this year. In one course video uploaded to the website, a voiceover presenting the material suddenly morphs into a Spanish accent for about 30 seconds, before switching back to a British accent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Guardian reviewed materials from the Staffordshire course and used two different AI detectors – Winston AI and Originality AI – to scan course materials from this year. Both of them found that a number of the assignments and presentations had “a very high likelihood of being AI-generated”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in the course, James said, he brought his concerns to the student representative during a monthly meeting. Then, in late November, he aired them during a lecture, which was recorded as a part of the course materials. In the recording, he asks the lecturer to not bother with the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know these slides are AI-generated, I know that everyone in this meeting knows these slides are AI-generated, I would rather you just scrap these slides,” he says. “I do not want to be taught by GPT.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon after, the student representative on the course chimes in, saying: “We have fed this back, James, and the response was that teachers are allowed to use a variety of tools. We were quite frustrated by this response.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another student says: “There are some useful things in the presentation. But it’s like, 5% is useful nuggets, and a lot is repetition. There is some gold in the bottom of this pan. But presumably we could get the gold ourselves, by asking ChatGPT.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lecturer laughs uncomfortably. “I appreciate people being candid …” he says, then he changes the subject to another tutorial he made – using ChatGPT. “I’ve done this short notice, to be honest,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, the course head told James that two human lecturers would be going over the material for the final session, “so you don’t get an AI experience”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to a query from the Guardian, the University of Staffordshire said “academic standards and learning outcomes were maintained” on the course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It said: “The University of Staffordshire supports the responsible and ethical use of digital technologies in line with our guidance. AI tools may support elements of preparation, but they do not replace academic expertise and must always be used in ways that uphold academic integrity and sector standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the university brought in a non-AI lecturer for the last lecture in the course, James and Owen said this was too little, too late, especially because the university appears to have used AI in this year’s teaching material as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I feel like a bit of my life was stolen,” James said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Owen, who is in the middle of a career change, said he had chosen the course to get the underlying knowledge, not just the qualification – and felt it was a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“To be sat there with this material in front of you that is just really not worth anyone’s time, when you could be spending that time actually engaging with something worthwhile, is really frustrating,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;.............................&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE HONOURABLE MRS JUSTICE COLLINS RICE&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mrs Justice Collins Rice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a dispute between prominent ‘free software movement’ activists. The free software movement advances a philosophy and practice which values the freedom of users to create and share software enabling internet access, and challenges the dominance of ‘big tech’ software and systems over the online experience. That includes a preference for internet relay chat (‘IRC’), an online instant messaging system dating in origin from the 1990s, over the big social media platforms. The challenge the free software movement makes is not only of a technical, but also of a social, economic or ethical nature, and it espouses some wider sets of values accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Claimant, Dr Matthew Garrett, describes himself as a software engineer, computer security expert, and free software activist, with an academic background in (computational) genetics. He gained his doctorate at Cambridge University, and has worked with ARM Ltd, a Cambridge-based software design company, throughout his career. He is currently based in ‘Silicon Valley’ in California, where he holds a senior position at NVIDIA, one of the top half dozen big tech companies globally, and a part-time lectureship at the University of California, Berkeley, teaching operating systems security for a masters course. He sets out that he has worked on some of the most significant projects in the free software movement and won a Free Software Foundation award in 2013 for his work on Secure Boot, UEFI and the Linux kernel (at the time, he states, the FSF was one of the most important organisations in the world for the advancement of free software).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defendants are a Manchester-based married couple, each of whom operates a UK website focusing on free software information, interests and campaigns, and hosting an IRC channel. Dr Roy Schestowitz describes himself as a software engineer, interdisciplinary researcher and fair competition advocate, with an academic background in medical biophysics. He operates the website www.techrights.org (‘Techrights’). Mrs Rianne Schestowitz describes herself as a computer scientist who works for a FOSS (free and open-source software) specialist. She operates the website news.tuxmachines.org (‘Tuxmachines’). Both websites have been in operation for some two decades. These websites are declared by Dr Schestowitz to be not-for-profit undertakings – they are, he says, a committed labour of love on which they both publish tirelessly to the extent of thousands of articles a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett brings a claim in libel over a series of 24 publications appearing on either Techrights or Tuxmachines or both, in August and September 2023. The publications complained of appear at Annex A to this judgment. Dr Garrett brings a further claim in data protection in respect of these and a number of other publications appearing on the websites at around the same time. Dr and Mrs Schestowitz counterclaim in harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Litigation History&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett issued proceedings, and filed and served his particulars of claim, in April 2024. This had been preceded, as is usual, by a certain amount of correspondence before action, in which Dr Garrett had requested the removal of the publications from the websites. Dr and Mrs Schestowitz declined to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz filed and served a defence and counterclaim in September 2024. The libel claim was resisted on the grounds that (a) none of the publications complained of had caused or was likely to cause serious harm to Dr Garrett’s reputation, and (b) one or more of the statutory defences of truth, honest opinion and publication on a matter of public interest applied. The data protection claim was resisted on the ground that the journalistic purposes exemption applied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz’s pleadings had been professionally prepared, but they have been acting in person in recent months, including representing themselves at trial. There was a significant amount of interlocutory case management activity, overseen by the Masters, in August and September of 2025, notably in relation to timetabling the provision of witness statements by or on behalf of Dr and Mrs Schestowitz. These had still not been forthcoming by the time of the pre-trial review before Griffiths J on 6th October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz did not attend the PTR. Griffiths J proceeded in their absence. His order confirmed, among other things, that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;1.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;By the operation of CPR 32.10, because the Defendants have not served any witness statement or witness summary for use at trial by 29 August 2025, as required by the CCMC Order of Master Davison dated 15 January 2025 and the extension of time granted by the Order of Master Dagnall dated 27 August 2025, neither Defendant is permitted to call any witness to give oral evidence at trial.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;2.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Any application for relief from sanctions will be considered in accordance with CPR 3.8 and CPR 3.9 in the event that such an application is made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There appears to be no record that any formal application was subsequently made, although I was shown an unsealed version of an application by Dr and Mrs Schestowitz to set aside the order of Griffiths J. Dr Schestowitz confirmed to me at the opening of the trial on 30th October 2025, at which he and Mrs Schestowitz were informally supported by a defamation solicitor, that in any event no further order was sought on that (unsealed) application and no further application was being made. He told me that he and Mrs Schestowitz had taken a deliberate decision not to submit any evidence or call any witnesses, on financial grounds. He confirmed that he understood that meant that, while he and Mrs Schestowitz would be able to put Dr Garrett to proof of his claims, to cross-examine the claimant witnesses (Dr Garrett and his solicitor), and to make submissions to me, they would not be able by these means to introduce evidence in support of their defence and counterclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defamation ‘Preliminary Issues’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There had been no ‘preliminary issues’ determination ahead of trial in this case. Mr Hamer, Counsel for Dr Garrett, explained that the parties’ pleadings had not been very far apart in this respect. Nevertheless, there was no formal agreement about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Single natural and ordinary meaning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My preliminary task was therefore to “determine the single natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of, which is the meaning that the hypothetical reasonable reader would understand the words to bear”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legal principles I am required to apply in doing so are well established. I directed myself to the useful guidance on determination of ‘single natural and ordinary meaning’ distilled from the authorities (including that of the Supreme Court in Stocker v Stocker [2020] AC 593) and set out in Koutsogiannis v Random House Group[2020] 4 WLR 25,at [11] and [12]. The guidance of the authorities is of course just that – guidance – intended to simplify not complicate the exercise. And each case turns on its own facts. But the following briefly summarises the guidance as it applies to the present case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The governing principle in determining ‘meaning’ is reasonableness. The intention of the publisher (here, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz respectively) is irrelevant in law: the test focuses on how words are read, not how or why they came to be written. It is an objective, not subjective, test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each publication must be considered as a whole, in the context in which an ordinary reasonable reader would have read it. That reference to ‘context’ was explained by Nicklin J in Riley v Murray [2020] EMLR 20 at [15]-[17]. I can, and where relevant should, take account of: (a) matters of common knowledge – facts so well known that, for practical purposes, everybody knows them; (b) matters to be treated as intrinsic to the publication – for example via a hyperlink; and (c) any other material that could reasonably be expected to have been known or read by all the readers of the publication complained of. But otherwise, no evidence beyond the publication complained of is admissible as to what it means. And natural and ordinary meaning does not rely on a reader having any special knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am guided away from over-elaborate or lawyerly analysis of text. I need to avoid both literalism, and any strained or forced interpretation. I can and must determine the single meaning I myself consider correct, and am not bound by the meanings advanced by the parties (so long as I do not alight on something more injurious than a claimant's pleaded meaning).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I am to keep in mind, as guided, the perspective of an ordinary, reasonable reader of each article complained of, reading it once through as it appears, and forming an impression of what it conveys on its face. The reasonable reader is neither naïve nor suspicious; is able to read between the lines and pick up an implication; and is allowed a certain amount of loose thinking without being ‘avid for scandal’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fact/opinion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have further directed myself to Koutsogiannis at [16] and [17], as well as to Millett v Corbyn [2021] EWCA Civ 567, for guidance on considering whether the words complained of contain allegations of fact or expressions of opinion. I am reminded by the authorities that the test for the difference between fact and opinion is an objective one. That comes back to how the words would strike the ordinary reasonable reader. I have to look at the substance, not the intention of the writer or any label the writer may, or may not, have attached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subject matter and immediate context can be especially important here. In the classic formulation, “opinion is something which is or can reasonably be inferred to be a deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, judgment, remark or observation” (Clarke v Norton [1910] VLR 494 at page 499). But sometimes care is needed: there is a difference between comment which is pure opinion and comment which is an imputation of underlying fact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Factual allegations can be published with varying degrees of certainty as to what is being imputed. These degrees of certainty have been classically analysed at three distinct levels : level 1: the claimant is 'guilty' of the conduct alleged; level 2: there is 'reason to suspect' the claimant is guilty of the conduct alleged; and level 3: there are 'grounds for investigating whether' the claimant is guilty of the conduct alleged (Chase v. News Group Newspapers[2002] EWCA Civ 172).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While ‘meaning’ and ‘fact/opinion’ are distinct preliminary issues, the authorities counsel against trying to resolve them in too linear or compartmentalised a fashion. I have to bear in mind whether this is a case in which the questions of ‘meaning’ and ‘fact/opinion’ might throw light on each other, such that it would be wrong to tackle them in a sequence which proves to be a trap of false logic. I note the risk and seek to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defamatory Tendency&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test at common law for whether a (natural and ordinary) meaning is defamatory is well-established: whether it substantially affects in an adverse manner the attitude of other people towards a claimant, or has a tendency to do so. Some recent authorities put it in terms of identifying that a claimant has breached the common, shared values of our society (Millett v Corbyn). This is not about actual impact at this stage, it is about the meaning of the words themselves and their inherent tendency to damage someone’s reputation. ‘Substantially’ imports a threshold of gravity or seriousness (Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Ltd [2010] EWHC 1414).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approach, Consideration and Determinations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I adopted the standard approach to the determination of meaning and the other preliminary issues. I read each article complained of quickly once through, before knowing what either party wanted to say about it. I formed and noted my initial impressions. I then read the parties’ pleadings and skeleton arguments or position statements, heard oral submissions (neither Dr nor Mrs Schestowitz chose to address me orally on the preliminary issues), and reserved judgment as to how far to adjust my initial views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table attached to this judgment at Annex B sets out the parties’ rival meanings and, in the final column, the matters I have now determined. Where relevant, I have included some short explanatory notes for my decisions where there appeared to be any significant dispute about a particular issue. The following general points also arise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I have had to reflect in a number of respects on whether my preliminary views on meaning needed to be moderated on the ground that they went further than those contended for by the Claimant. Where I have concluded that my meaning was simply a particularisation of matters expressed in more general terms by the Claimant, I have not done so. Where, however, I had identified a meaning not referred to in the Claimant’s pleading, I have withdrawn it for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, while each publication’s meaning is determined on its own terms, some common repetitive themes emerge. Dr Garrett is chiefly accused of an online campaign of material which is (variously) criminal, illegal or offensive. The criminal matters alleged include cybercrime, hate crime, blackmail, issuing threats of violence or death, and matters adjacent to terrorism. Other illegal matters alleged include defamation, harassment and online abuse. Offensive matters alleged include material that is variously racist, antisemitic, misogynist, homophobic or otherwise hateful or discriminatory, sexually incontinent, or drugs-related. Dr Garrett is alleged to have waged this campaign through the medium of IRC ‘sockpuppet’ accounts – accounts under pseudonymous user nicknames intended to be a vehicle for distributing material anonymously and deniably. Many posts from these accounts are reproduced in the articles complained of. Dr Garrett is also repeatedly alleged to be an uncontrolled user of illegal class A drugs, principally crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, I have concurred with the parties in understanding that most of the allegations relate to online behaviour. But there are some notable exceptions to that, chief of which is the allegation relating to Dr Garrett’s being an habitual cocaine user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, where criminal or illegal acts are alleged, the meanings I have determined are closer to those contended for by the Claimant – namely that these are allegations of fact at Chase level 1. An ordinary reasonable reader would, in my view, have no difficulty in understanding that Dr Garrett is straightforwardly being said to have committed them. Where, however, offensive attitudinal matters are alleged – racism, misogyny, etc – the meanings I have determined are closer to those contended for by the Defendants – namely that these are evaluative expressions of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although it is not formally admitted, there can be no doubt at all that each of the publications is of grossly ‘defamatory tendency’ at common law. They allege multiple and serious transgressions of society’s norms, up to and including the criminal law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Serious Harm’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By section 1(1) of the Defamation Act 2013, ‘A statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leading authority on this provision is the decision of the Supreme Court in Lachaux v Independent Print Ltd [2020] AC 612. As Lord Sumption’s judgment makes clear ([12]-[14]), section 1(1) imposed a new threshold test for defamation claims, the application of which is to be determined by reference to the actual facts about the impact of a publication, and not just to the meaning of the words. It requires real-world effects to be established beyond the inherent ‘defamatory tendency’ of any publication. The statutory term ‘has caused’ points to some historic reputational harm, which can be shown actually to have occurred; and ‘is likely to cause’ points to probable, actual, future reputational harm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The serious harm test is a question of fact, and facts must be established by evidence. Facts and evidence – and causation – are matters which are entirely case-specific. But a claimant’s statutory task of establishing that publishees changed their minds for the worse about them – and to a degree warranting the description of ‘serious reputational harm’ – because of reading something, poses clear evidential challenges. That is partly because of the nature of the harm in question: the ‘harm’ of defamation is the effect of a publication in the mind of a third-party publishee (reader), and not any action they may take as a result (nor is it the direct effect of a publication on a claimant reading it themselves). And it is partly because of simple practical considerations: particularly in cases of mass publication, the minds of the publishees may be effectively evidentially unreachable. In such cases, finding enough readers willing to testify that they thought the worse of a claimant has long been recognised as a prohibitively impractical undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authorities have therefore developed some detailed guidelines for trial courts applying the serious harm test in ‘mass publication’ cases. In such cases, Lachaux confirmed (at [21]) that a claimant may be able to discharge their evidential burden of establishing serious reputational harm by inference drawn from a factual matrix combining the meaning of the words, the situation of the claimant, the circumstances of the publication(s) complained of and the inherent circumstantial probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That matrix, in turn, has to be established as a matter of fact and evidence. But again, the authorities give some assistance. The well-established ‘grapevine’ or ‘percolation’ tendencies (Slipper v BBC[1991] 1 QB 283; Cairns v Modi[2013] 1 WLR 1015) of defamatory publications, particularly online and through social media of any kind, may in an appropriate case be factored into inference about scale of publication. And the likely identity, as well as the numbers, of at least some of a class of publishees may be relevant to the assessment of harm, for example where some individuals may be particularly positioned to lose confidence in a claimant or take adverse action as a result. But these are highly fact-specific matters; the inferences which may properly be drawn in any individual case depend entirely on the circumstances of that case. The Court of Appeal in Blake v Fox[2025] EWCA Civ 1321 has, however, recently indicated that if a claimant establishes a factual matrix of mass publication, grave defamatory tendency of the content, and the claimant’s significant reputational exposure, then the inference of serious reputational harm may have to be considered by a court to be irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consideration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approach, and Gravity of Imputation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett advances a wholly inferential case of serious harm, relying on this being a case of mass publication, very grave inherent defamatory content, the engagement of his own professional and reputational capital, and inherent probabilities. The burden lies on him to establish this underpinning factual matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a starting point, I have no difficulty in the first place in recognising the heavy gravity of the allegations made in each and every publication complained of. Dr Garrett’s responsibility for a relentless online campaign of harassment and abuse, by the covert means of sockpuppet accounts, is advanced as fact. Extensive, multiple and serious online criminality is advanced as fact. Dr Garrett is accused of publishing a range of toxic or highly offensive online material by reference to direct quotations from the sockpuppet accounts he is accused of authoring; this material is on its face grossly offensive in many dimensions and carries clear implications of the social and moral turpitude of its author. Habitual illegal class A drug use is advanced as fact. In the meanings I have determined – and as to which the parties’ pleaded cases were not in the end separated by a wide margin, since they largely spoke for themselves – the publications complained of are undoubtedly very grave indeed. I did not hear that seriously disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz however make a double challenge to Dr Garrett’s task of establishing a factual matrix to support an inference of serious harm. They put him to proof (a) that this is in fact a mass publication case, and (b) that his reputation is materially engaged – in each case, within the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Situation of the Claimant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking the latter first, the ‘situation of the claimant’ in this case is that Dr Garrett was born in Ireland and moved to England with his family as a very young child. He emigrated to California in 2009 and has not lived in the UK for 16 years. He holds UK, Irish and US citizenship. To succeed on his claim as brought, he has to demonstrate serious reputational harm within the court’s jurisdiction – that is, in England and Wales. His evidence about his reputation here is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett states that his reputation in England is both established, and ‘immensely important’ to him. Before 2009 he had worked for the University of Cambridge and had done other Cambridge-based work, starting by doing contract work and working for a tech start-up, before going on to work for Collabora (described as a private open-source software consulting company headquartered in Cambridge) and for Red Hat, a US company with a wholly-owned British subsidiary which had been his employer here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He draws attention to his current senior role with NVIDIA, which ‘does significant business in Britain’. In that role he has undertaken collaborative work with British companies including Collabora, Linaro, ARM and other consulting firms, including while present in the jurisdiction. He describes these ‘ongoing collaborations’ as being ‘extremely important in terms of providing value to my employer since then’. His evidence is that ‘the reason I am valuable to my employer and my previous employers, is that I am exceedingly good at working across a range of different technologies and with a range of different companies. If my ability to work with any of the companies who are working in a specific field is impaired, the value proposition of me for my employer goes down’. He states that damage to his reputation in England ‘would have an impact on NVIDIA’s willingness to continue employing me’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett draws attention to the fact that he holds a teaching position at a US university with an international reputation in his field, including in this country, and was awarded a ‘distinguished faculty award’ by that university. His evidence is that his past and present academic reputation is engaged in England. Of his future plans, he states that ‘my goal in the end, at the point where I am in a position to retire, is to be able to move back to the United Kingdom and potentially adopt a position at a university here’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he is regularly invited to speak at major events (with thousands of attendees) concerned with free software, Linux or cybersecurity generally, and has done so in the UK on half a dozen occasions in recent years. He has also spoken at major European events with significant attendance from UK participants, including in the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett also gives evidence that he has many friends and colleagues in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did not hear this evidence materially challenged in substance. Dr Garrett’s evidence on the nature, extent and value of his reputation in England and Wales was clear and straightforward. I can and do accept it. It enables me to find as a fact that his professional, employment, academic and personal reputation is materially engaged within the jurisdiction. I make that finding accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extent of Publication&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The principal dispute in this case on the question of serious reputational harm is, however, that of extent of publication (within the jurisdiction) of the articles complained of. Mr Hamer contended for an inference of a readership in the tens of thousands, within the jurisdiction, for each article complained of, to date. The evidence of this before me was limited. I do not of course have any evidence from Dr and Mrs Schestowitz, and the pre-trial disclosure exercise revealed no analytics for readership of the articles in question (the defence states that ‘site analysis data is wiped after short periods of retention’).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not in dispute that the websites get something like a million hits a day. A hit is not an indication of readership; a single page may require a number of ‘hits’ to be viewed. Dr Schestowitz made a challenge that something like half of those could be immediately discounted as machine-generated (bots, crawlers and so on). He made a challenge to the remaining figure based on the proportion of the anglophone world attributable to the UK being a percentage in the low single figures. He made a further challenge based on the high rate with which new articles are posted on both websites, and the relative age (and therefore incremental occlusion) of the material complained of. He challenged that there was no evidential basis in the ‘million a day’ figure for a readership above tens in the UK on any one day, and that many of them would likely be repeat viewers, reading the same articles again and again. Dr Schestowitz pointed out that neither he nor Mrs Schestowitz publishes on, or is a user of, mass social media platforms, that their websites attract viewers with similar preferences against modern social media, and that the grapevine or percolation effects often deployed in defamation litigation to encourage inference of mass publication are accordingly of limited application here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these circumstances, and having been put to proof of extent of publication, Dr Garrett’s case that this is an instance of mass publication was advanced evidentially by him, and in argument by Mr Hamer, along the following lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, all of the articles complained of remain online, and have done so since their original publication more than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, a number of the articles appear reduplicated on both websites, and a number cross refer to each other via embedded hyperlinks. The final publication (the Wiki page) is a compendious hyperlink library of nearly all the articles complained of. The articles, in other words, contain within themselves mechanisms of accessibility and republication, and hence maximise readership potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, and bearing in mind the extent of his reputational engagement in the UK, recent Google searches on Dr Garrett’s name from a UK location were bringing up links to Techrights and Tuxmachines articles complained of (including the final Wiki page publication) on the first page, and, it appears, also did so around the time of the original publication (as one of the Tuxmachines posts seems to have acknowledged). That suggests both (a) the continuing ready accessibility of the material complained of to those interested in Dr Garrett and (b) the historical popularity of actual access to the Schestowitz websites via Google. Google is of course only one among a number of popular search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, both websites are well-established. It is conspicuous that each has been active over two decades; that is a significant marker in the field. Dr Garrett’s evidence is that they are serious, sought-after, well-regarded, popular and trusted in the anglophone free software community, including for news, campaigning and educational content. Neither Dr nor Mrs Schestowitz suggested otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final piece in the jigsaw Mr Hamer sought to assemble is a centuries-old English legal principle, derived from the case of Armory v Delamirie(1721) 93 ER 664, that, to the extent that there are gaps in trial evidence, a party who is responsible for them is not entitled to benefit from them. The principle in Armory has been recognised in the caselaw as having a potential to apply in defamation actions to assist a claimant in discharging their burden of proof, where a defendant has failed to provide disclosure or evidence of extent of publication (see, for example, Dudley v Phillips [2022] EWHC 930 (QB) at [25]). Here, Mr Hamer submitted, not only were the relevant analytical data not preserved or disclosed, but a deliberate decision was made by the Defendants to provide no evidence of the extent of the publications for which they were responsible, and therefore not to submit themselves to cross-examination about it. In those circumstances, Mr Harmer submitted, readership of at least tens of thousands could fairly be inferred in relation to any and all of the publications complained of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have reflected carefully on Dr Schestowitz’s challenge, Mr Hamer’s submissions and Dr Garrett’s evidence. I bear in mind the years-long persistence, cross-referencing and indexing apparent within the articles. I can and do place weight on the evidence I have to suggest that the publications complained of were accessible to, and accessed by, a UK public searching online for information about Dr Garrett. It is common ground that Techrights and Tuxmachines are popular and authoritative sites, including in the UK, among those interested or active in the free software community. I do not understand it to be in dispute that that wider community in the UK is otherwise than substantial, perhaps in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Dr Garrett is, I have accepted, someone with a profile in that community, and the allegations in the articles complained of are of a sensational and eye-catching nature (and tone). In these circumstances, it appears to me that a total readership of the articles to date, including by way of some onward republication (percolation), of the order of at least thousands is more probably than not a fair estimate. And if there are doubts about that, Dr Garrett is entitled to rely on the Armory principle to have them resolved in his favour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inherent Probabilities and Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A readership of at least thousands makes a fair case, in context, for regarding this as an example of ‘mass publication’. It is not of the order of a national newspaper or news channel. But nor is it a case dealing with publication to a limited class of identified or identifiable individuals. Just as important as the raw numbers is the identity of the likely readership. I am satisfied that publication in this case was to precisely the constituency – individuals in the UK interested in the free software community and in the doings of free software activists, and who had either already heard of or were likely to take an interest in Dr Garrett – with which Dr Garrett’s UK reputation was most closely engaged. I have to consider that in conjunction with the gravity of the allegations. Sockpuppetry, trolling, inappropriate sexual content and hate speech are allegations of profound breaches of the ‘netiquette’ of this community in their own right. The accusations about the content of this behaviour – serious online crime – push those allegations to the extremes of gravity in context. Coupled with the imputations going to Dr Garrett’s offline private life, including sexual misconduct (or crime) and the habitual use of illegal class A drugs, it is hard to imagine a more serious assault on the professional and personal reputation of a prominent free software activist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all these circumstances, I accept Dr Garrett’s case that not only is the inherent meaning of the publications complained of grave, but they have caused and are likely to cause him serious reputational harm. Indeed, on the basis of the factual matrix advanced and established, and mindful of the guidance in Blake v Fox, the inference of serious harm may have to be regarded as inescapable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Statutory Defences to Defamation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The statutory defences provided by the Defamation Act 2013 are set out as follows, as relevant:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Defences&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;2.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Truth&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the imputation conveyed by the statement complained of is substantially true.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Subsection (3) applies in an action for defamation if the statement complained of conveys two or more distinct imputations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If one or more of the imputations is not shown to be substantially true, the defence under this section does not fail if, having regard to the imputations which are shown to be substantially true, the imputations which are not shown to be substantially true do not seriously harm the claimant's reputation..&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;3.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Honest opinion&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the following conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The first condition is that the statement complained of was a statement of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The second condition is that the statement complained of indicated, whether in general or specific terms, the basis of the opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(4)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The third condition is that an honest person could have held the opinion on the basis of—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;any fact which existed at the time the statement complained of was published;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;anything asserted to be a fact in a privileged statement published before the statement complained of.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(5)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The defence is defeated if the claimant shows that the defendant did not hold the opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(7)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of subsection (4)(b) a statement is a “privileged statement” if the person responsible for its publication would have one or more of the following defences if an action for defamation were brought in respect of it—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;a defence under section 4 (publication on matter of public interest);&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;4.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Publication on matter of public interest&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;the statement complained of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matter of public interest; and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;the defendant reasonably believed that publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Subject to subsections (3) and (4), in determining whether the defendant has shown the matters mentioned in subsection (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the statement complained of was, or formed part of, an accurate and impartial account of a dispute to which the claimant was a party, the court must in determining whether it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that publishing the statement was in the public interest disregard any omission of the defendant to take steps to verify the truth of the imputation conveyed by it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(4)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In determining whether it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest, the court must make such allowance for editorial judgement as it considers appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(5)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, the defence under this section may be relied upon irrespective of whether the statement complained of is a statement of fact or a statement of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All three defences are pleaded in the present case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Truth Defence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pleading and evidence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pleading of the truth defence – that is, the pleading that what is said about Dr Garrett in the publications complained of, in the natural and ordinary meanings I have determined, is in objective fact true – relies on (a) a small number of messages Dr Garrett accepts he posted and (b) his asserted authorship of a campaign of threats, abuse and harassment conducted from a list of named sockpuppet accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authorship or control of these accounts has consistently been strenuously denied by Dr Garrett. I have no evidence from the Defendants to support it. Instead, they necessarily rely on an inferential case built on a limited number of pleaded facts, some of which are undisputed. I consider them in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the defence relies on an incident a few years prior to the sockpuppet campaign, in which Dr Garrett admittedly registered himself online in two borrowed names for the purpose of making a rhetorical or satirical point about the owner of those names. Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he did so openly, and with the knowledge of the owner (who had himself vacated the names in order to borrow another user’s nickname – which was in part Dr Garrett’s point in also doing so). Dr Schestowitz clearly takes exception to that particular piece of theatricality as a major breach of netiquette in its own right, and regards it as a sign or symptom of propensity for sockpuppetry. But the incident in question, on its face, is plainly something quite different from the covert use of sockpuppet accounts to publish illegal or offensive material, and is not in my judgment capable of indicating any sort of propensity to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, it is said there was an incident in which Dr Garrett’s own named account and one of the sockpuppet accounts experienced simultaneous dropped connections. If established, that could indicate dual operation by a single individual. The evidence from the Claimant is that the dropped connections were not in fact simultaneous. I have no evidential basis for doing otherwise than proceeding on that basis. This pleading cannot in the circumstances support an inference of Dr Garrett’s authorship of the sockpuppet posts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, there are some facts pleaded which are capable of linking the sockpuppets to each other. They are not capable of being linked to Dr Garrett by that means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, it is pleaded that after Dr Schestowitz had made a complaint naming Dr Garrett as the suspected author of the complaints, they subsided. I have no evidence of this – of its extent, timing, or at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, it is suggested there is some similarity in the language used by Dr Garrett in his own account and that in one of the sockpuppet accounts. That suggested similarity is not particularised. I was not taken to it by Dr or Mrs Schestowitz. It is not immediately obvious on the face of the publications complained of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sixth, one of the sockpuppet accounts on one occasion posted a short insult in the Irish language. Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he does not speak Irish and would have been incapable of posting that insult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seventh, it is suggested that one of the sockpuppet accounts used the first person singular in referring to an accusation made against Dr Garrett. I was not taken to this example, or its context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz took me to a small number of posts Dr Garrett had made on a website he had operated some 25 years ago, when he would have been aged about 20. In one, he made a comment about people feeling the need to punch someone. In another he referred to being sorely tempted to write a book entitled Axe-murdering for fun and profit as a disincentive to people bothering him. In a third he expressed exasperation with some individuals along lines that it made him want to stab them and then stab himself. In a later social media post in 2018 on Twitter (X), he was involved in a game of listing criteria for electing a new prime minister, in which he proposed ‘1. Cancel Brexit; 2. Decriminalise most drugs; 3. Spend less on candles [an internet meme]; 4. Resign’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no difficulty in immediately recognising all of these as examples of jocular or facetious rhetoric. Dr Garrett’s own evidence was that he now considered them callow and in poor taste; they were mostly decades old, and he would not express himself in this kind of way any longer. Dr Schestowitz plainly regarded them as unpleasant breaches of netiquette. But the proposition that these examples should be taken literally, and this sort of online discourse considered indicative of a propensity in real life to the use of sockpuppetry to threaten or commit violence, or to an illegal drugs habit, cannot begin to get off the ground. They are clearly nowhere near any such thing. Nor are such allusions to bladed weaponry as they contain any sort of basis for inferring that sockpuppet accounts under names such as ‘Dr Axe’ were being operated by Dr Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is Dr Garrett’s evidence that at least some of the sockpuppet posts were posted at a time when he can establish he was teaching a university class. It is also his evidence that it was not practically possible for him to have been the author of those posts, both because he did not have access to the IRC channel on his phone and because he could not have done so without attracting the attention of his students.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assessment and conclusions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is plain that the onslaught of sockpuppet trolling to which Mrs Schestowitz in particular was subjected was a truly appalling experience – the very antithesis of everything Tuxmachines and Techrights stands for in the free software community. There is not the slightest suggestion that either Dr or Mrs Schestowitz did anything to invite or deserve it. They are both clearly and justifiably angered, dismayed, distressed and hurt by it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also plain that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz do not think highly of Dr Garrett in general. Some of that appears to have had its origins in differences of professional views. Some of it may be to do with his choices to move to Silicon Valley and to work for, with or alongside big tech companies; Dr Schestowitz explained clearly to me how and why they themselves have made different choices. Some of it may be to do with Dr Garrett’s modes of online expression and what they consider to be his poor netiquette; Dr and Mrs Schestowitz explained to me that these are matters they take very seriously, and that they are serious people running serious websites dealing in serious technical and socio-political matters. They do not admire facetiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also plain enough that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz have found it entirely straightforward to convince themselves that Dr Garrett was behind the trolling. But the task they have given themselves in pleading the truth defence in defamation proceedings is to establish or prove, on the balance of probabilities, that that is objectively true. And they have made that exceptionally difficult for themselves by advancing no evidence for it. I can only uphold a truth defence if I am given a sufficient evidential basis for doing so. I have looked hard at the defence as pleaded. I can recognise the matters I have been shown, in all the contextual circumstances, as the reasons Dr and Mrs Schestowitz advance to explain their suspicions of Dr Garrett. But I cannot possibly recognise in them, singly or together, anything capable of establishing the objective truth that Dr Garrett was their troll. They are simply not capable of sustaining the weight of a truth defence, or enabling me properly to find that, more probably than not, what the publications said about Dr Garrett was the verifiable truth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make such a finding, I would have both to reject Dr Garrett’s own clear evidence, and to discount the possibility that, if Dr and Mrs Schestowitz suspected Dr Garrett of the posts, some third party operator(s) responsible for the sockpuppets might at some level have encouraged that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found Dr Garrett in general a straightforward witness who gave a clear account of himself under sustained challenge in the witness box. I have been given no proper basis for rejecting his plain, unqualified and vehement denial that he ever had anything to do with the sockpuppet campaign against Dr and Mrs Schestowitz. The matters pleaded by way of the truth defence barely raise a statable case that he did. I accept Dr Garrett’s evidence. He is entitled in these circumstances to a clear finding that I have not been shown any evidence on which I can fairly place any weight, that he was responsible for the sockpuppets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being so, there is no such evidence before me that Dr Garrett habitually uses illegal class A drugs. There is no such evidence he has committed any crimes. There is no such evidence he has threatened, abused or harassed anyone, or that he has espoused or promulgated repugnant and hateful views. There is no basis on which I can properly find any of the many factual accusations levelled against him in the publications complained of to be true. The truth defence must fail in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Honest Opinion Defence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The honest opinion defence is pleaded bare, otherwise than by reference to the allegation that Dr Garrett was responsible for the sockpuppet trolling. In the meanings I have determined, the allegations identified as matters of opinion are all identified as descriptors of the content of the campaign he is alleged to have pursued. That is the only ‘basis of opinion’ articulated in the articles complained of for the purposes of section 3(3) of the Defamation Act 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, as I have concluded, I am unable to uphold the contended factual truth of Dr Garrett’s responsibility for the sockpuppet trolling, that is not a basis on which the honest opinion defence can be upheld either. An honest person has no basis in contemporaneous fact, as required by section 3(4)(a), for an opinion that Dr Garrett was responsible for an offensive and hateful campaign, when he cannot be shown to have been responsible for the campaign at all. The honest opinion defence is unsustainable accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Public Interest Defence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have reminded myself of the review of the authorities on this defence set out by Nicklin J in Turley v Unite The Union [2019] EWHC 3547 (QB) at [137]-[138]. A three stage approach has to be taken. Stage one asks whether the statement complained of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matter of public interest. The second establishes whether the defendant believed publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest. The third asks whether any such belief was reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pleading of the defence in the present case addresses the first question by asserting that all the statements complained of were publications on a matter of public interest, namely ‘the exposure of a vicious and persistent troll committing, among other wrongs, communication and harassment offences in an attempt by the Claimant to intimidate and obstruct promotion of computing standards argued for by the Defendants and that have wide significance within the field of computing’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authorities guide that public interest is a broad concept in this context, and can be considered in the light of whether publications make a contribution to a matter of public debate, but is distinguishable from matters that are personal or private. I can see that the promotion of high standards of online behaviour, and the calling out of unlawful, intimidatory or suppressive behaviour, are capable of being included in the broad ambit of a ‘matter of public interest’. The question here would really be about whether any of the publications complained of is recognisable as contributing to it. Dr and Mrs Schestowitz took a decision not to write general articles about the trolling they had received (nor, indeed, it would appear, to block the sockpuppet accounts), but instead (a) to republish quantities of it and (b) to attribute it to Dr Garrett in strongly and personally deprecatory terms. There can be little doubt on a fair reading of the articles that their focus is squarely on attacking Dr Garrett rather than any more objective or issues-based purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any event, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz face a major hurdle at the second stage of the test, because I have no evidence as to their beliefs at the time of publication. Here is what Nicklin J said at [138(vii)] in Turley v Unite:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A defendant wishing to rely upon the defence must have believed what s/he published was in the public interest: Economou [139(2)] and [153] per Warby J (at first instance: [2017] EMLR 4). The defendant must have addressed his/her mind to the issue. This element of the defence is not established by showing that a notional reasonable person could have believed that the publication was in the public interest, but that the relevant defendant did believe that it was. In terms of evidence, if a defendant leaves this issue unaddressed in his/her witness evidence, the defence is likely to fail at this initial hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the present case, of course, there is no witness evidence from either defendant at all. They are required to establish their state of mind by setting it out in evidence. They have not done so. I cannot just assume it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the third stage, had they been able to reach that far, the problems for sustaining this defence would only multiply. The reasonableness of any subjective public interest belief has to be tested objectively, including by probing what a publisher had done and not done to ‘guard as far as possible against the publication of untrue defamatory material’ and what checks and enquiries they had made. Here is Nicklin J again, at [138] of Turley v Unite:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(xv)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a basic requirement of fairness and responsible journalism that someone who is going to publish a defamatory allegation against a person without being required to show that it is true should give him/her a fair opportunity to put his/her side of the story; … This is not only to be fair to the subject, it recognises that the subject may well have relevant factual information to provide that may affect the decision to publish or the terms in which the publication is presented… . The importance of making an attempt to present the subject of the publication’s side of the story may require the publisher to consider whether others who could reasonably be expected to have relevant information about the allegations should be approached… .&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(xvi)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although … it will not always be necessary to approach the subject of a defamatory article for comment prior to publication, the circumstances in which a publisher will be able to satisfy the Court that it was reasonable not to have done so will necessarily be rare… .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no evidence as to any due diligence undertaken before the articles complained of were published. The defence is pleaded by reference to the reasonableness of reliance on the assemblage of matters I have considered in relation to the truth defence above, which, for the reasons I have given, are not reasonably recognisable as an exercise in considered research and verification. Dr Garrett was not approached to give his side of the story. One of the articles complained of (publication 14 and 15) reproduced a paragraph from a letter Dr Garrett had written on 5th August 2023, stating that ‘As I have previously informed you via email, I am not responsible for the elusive_woman IRC account or any of the other accounts you have incorrectly asserted I am linked to. I have provided evidence that I am not that person’ – namely that one of the postings from the account mentioned was made at a time he was teaching a class. The letter had gone on to challenge Dr Schestowitz for appearing to accept that others might have been involved in the trolling, but that part of the letter was not reproduced. Beneath the (cropped) picture of the letter was commentary beginning ‘Oh, wow! How will I know if you are lying again?’ and continuing with invective and multiple accusations against him. This has little claim to being in the nature of affording a fair right of reply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Schestowitz made an eloquent case to me for the websites he and his wife operate being quintessentially public interest, not-for-profit endeavours, conscientiously dedicated to the interests of the free software community, trusted and well-regarded as such. I can accept that. I can also easily understand that he and Mrs Schestowitz had felt attacked and threatened by the sockpuppet trolling, on both a personal basis and on behalf of all they were trying to do and achieve with their websites. That is not, however, enough to engage the public interest defence to publication of libels that cannot be shown to be true, blaming and defaming someone for the trolling on no better basis than that produced in these proceedings. Any belief in the public interest in naming and shaming Dr Garrett – repeatedly, and in the most personal and derogatory terms – on such a basis could not in my judgment be regarded as a reasonable one for the purposes of the defence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all these circumstances, the public interest defence inevitably fails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summary and conclusions on liability in defamation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz are proud of Techrights and Tuxmachines – their lives’ dedicated labour, passion and achievement. They are proud of the websites’ decades-long record of hosting an important and well-regarded IRC for the free software community in the UK and beyond, and of the thousands of informed and informative articles the websites have carried, including the results of some significant investigative journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They were understandably horrified to become the victims of an anonymous internet campaign of abuse, threats and harassment a couple of years ago. Nothing could have been further from the websites’ ethos, and it must have been traumatising for them on a personal level. Their response was publicly and repeatedly to blame Dr Garrett for it all, having convinced themselves they had some reasons for suspecting him of being behind the anonymous trolling – and to do so in a manner that was bitter, highly personal and thoroughly derogatory. They were undeterred by his protests that he had nothing to do with it. They steadfastly refused to take their accusatory material down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett has been successful in advancing a defamation claim to the point at which Dr and Mrs Schestowitz are required by law either to concede the claim or defend it. They chose to defend it, but they chose to do so without advancing any evidence in support of their defences. A court’s job is to apply the law to the facts as it finds them, and to find the relevant facts according to the evidence before it. If it is provided with no evidence in support of a libel defence, there is a limit to what a court can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have considered the defences pleaded by Dr and Mrs Schestowitz as best I can, given that they provided me with no evidence to work with. The bases they advanced for their suspicions that Dr Garrett was behind the sockpuppet trolling were simply not capable in the circumstances of adding up to an evidential proof on which a court could properly find that was, objectively, true. That allegation was at the heart of their resistance to Dr Garrett’s claim, and they have not enabled me properly to do anything other than reject it as capable of founding a defence, either by establishing that they had done due diligence at the time, or by advancing evidence or proof of objective truth I could consider at trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A defamation claimant in these circumstances is entitled to a judgment, and to remedies, which repudiate the publications complained of, vindicate his reputation, and restore his good name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Data Protection Claim&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr Hamer indicated to me at trial that, in the event that I upheld Dr Garrett’s claim in defamation, I could consider myself invited to conclude that it was unnecessary for me to consider the data protection claim on its merits. In the circumstances, I accept that invitation. Although the data protection claim extends to a number of publications additional to those on which the libel claim was based, and although it extends to the processing of Dr Garrett’s personal data in forms other than publication, I am satisfied that embarking on a full analysis of the data protection claim would be disproportionate to any additional vindicatory justice, or remedies, it could potentially achieve for Dr Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Harassment Counterclaim&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides as follows, as material:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;1.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Prohibition of harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A person must not pursue a course of conduct—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which amounts to harassment of another, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(1A) A person must not pursue a course of conduct —&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which involves harassment of two or more persons, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which he knows or ought to know involves harassment of those persons, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(c)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;by which he intends to persuade any person (whether or not one of those mentioned above)—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(i)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;not to do something that he is entitled or required to do, or&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(ii)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;to do something that he is not under any obligation to do.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this section …, the person whose course of conduct is in question ought to know that it amounts to or involves harassment of another if a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think the course of conduct amounted to harassment of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;3.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Civil remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An actual or apprehended breach of section 1(1) may be the subject of a claim in civil proceedings by the person who is or may be the victim of the course of conduct in question.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On such a claim, damages may be awarded for (among other things) any anxiety caused by the harassment and any financial loss resulting from the harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;3A. Injunctions to protect persons from harassment within section 1(1A)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This section applies where there is an actual or apprehended breach of section 1(1A) by any person (“ the relevant person ”).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In such a case—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;any person who is or may be a victim of the course of conduct in question, or&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;any person who is or may be a person falling within section 1(1A)(c),&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;may apply to the High Court or the county court for an injunction restraining the relevant person from pursuing any conduct which amounts to harassment in relation to any person or persons mentioned or described in the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz’s counterclaim is pleaded by reference to Dr Garrett’s alleged responsibility for the sockpuppet course of conduct. For the reasons I have already given, I cannot make the necessary findings of fact on which that allegation inevitably relies. The counterclaim as pleaded necessarily fails for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the trial hearing, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz also made extensive and sustained submissions objecting to the manner in which Dr Garrett and his legal team have been conducting this litigation against them. It is plain that they have both, in general, found the experience of being proceeded against for libel intrusive, frightening and intimidatory. I was told that they experienced it as motivated by an intention to harm them and their websites financially, and to interfere with their investigative journalism. They objected specifically to Dr Garrett’s having made contact with their internet service provider and other web hosts in an attempt to have the publications taken down, to the obtaining of their postal and online contact details, to the threatening tone of solicitors’ correspondence, to the conduct of the disclosure process, to the conduct by the same firm of solicitors of a second set of proceedings against them which Dr and Mrs Schestowitz had unsuccessfully sought to have consolidated with Dr Garrett’s claim, and to a reference made in formal documentation to a previous name of Mrs Schestowitz, a matter to which she took extremely strong exception. They felt, in short, that they had been ‘harassed’ by this litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I emphasise that none of this formed any part of their counterclaim as pleaded, nor is it evidenced, and I am not as a result in any proper position to make any findings of liability in harassment based on it. I also had to explain the constraints of legal professional privilege on some of the matters Dr and Mrs Schestowitz wanted to explore with Dr Garrett and his solicitor under cross-examination, in relation to their counterclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to record also that Dr Garrett in turn takes strong exception to the manner in which Dr Schestowitz has himself conducted this litigation as a litigant in person. Mr Hamer referred to what he considered to be racist attacks on Dr Garrett’s lawyers, posted on Techrights, which he described as probably the worst example he had seen of such conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this may need to be explored further if and when it comes to the stage of dealing with the costs of this litigation. That is a matter on which the parties will need to reflect following hand-down of this judgment. It may be that formal submissions and witness evidence may in due course be needed to resolve it. But none of it is properly relevant to the determination of liability on the counterclaim as pleaded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the reasons I have given, I cannot be satisfied that, more probably than not, Dr Garrett was responsible for the course of conduct comprising the sockpuppet trolling. The counterclaim must fail accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remedies&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Libel damages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The starting point for any award of damages in any tort is that the court should award a sum of money which will, as nearly as possible, restore the injured party to the same position he would have been in had the tort never been committed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the nature and history of libel, and its focus on reputational harm and the restorative vindication of reputation, has resulted in the evolution of a distinctive approach to assessing damages for defamation. As Nicklin J observed in Monir v Wood [2018] EWHC 3525 QB at [228], ‘Damages for libel cannot be calculated on any mathematical basis. By definition, they seek to provide compensation for harm that it is almost impossible to quantify in monetary terms’. The exercise is necessarily therefore a broad and holistic one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is further underlined by Nicklin J in his observations in Lachaux v Independent Print[2021] EWHC 1797 (QB) at [227] about claims for aggravated damages in defamation (of which this is one):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In my judgment, separating out a specific award for aggravated damages is unnecessary and, I consider, generally unwise. The Court’s task is to assess the proper level of compensation, taking into account all the relevant factors, which include any elements of aggravation. If, as the authorities recognise, the assessment of libel damages can never be mechanical or scientific, attributing a specific figure to something as nebulous as aggravation has an unconvincing foundation. Worse, as it would represent the imposition of a clearly identified additional sum of money, it risks the appearance of being directly attributed to the conduct of the defendant. That comes perilously close to looking like a penalty. For these reasons, I consider the better course is to fix a single award which, faithful to the principles by which damages in defamation are assessed, is solely to compensate the Claimant. The award can properly reflect any additional hurt and distress caused to the Claimant by the conduct of the Defendants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as being broad and holistic, the exercise is also highly fact-specific. But the framework of principle does include maintaining broad comparability within the tort and between torts. So regard may be had to other awards in defamation cases of a comparable nature (although the authorities emphasise that no two defamation cases are ever really the same). Regard may also be had to the (very differently assessed) awards in personal injury cases to ensure that damages for defamation are, and are seen to be, proportionate and realistic. But these comparative exercises are by way of guidance only, and the focus must remain, intensely, on the circumstances of the individual case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relevant legal principles particularly applicable to assessing libel damages were set out clearly by Warby J (as he then was) in Sloutsker v Romanova[2015] EWHC 2053 at [74]-[82], and in Barron v Vines [2016] EWHC 1226 at [20]-[21]. Broadly, the purpose of an award of damages in defamation proceedings is to compensate for injury to reputation and to feelings, and in particular to vindicate claimants, so far as money can to do that. Vindication and compensation are not to be thought of in compartmentalised terms: the overall purpose of the award remains to restore a claimant, to the extent money can do so, to the position as if the libel had not occurred. But in defamation cases that means not only redressing the balance in terms of quantifiable losses, but unequivocally, albeit proportionately, restoring a claimant’s standing to its previous state. As the authorities put it, the sum awarded must be an outward and visible sign of vindication, sending a message restoring a claimant’s good name ‘sufficient to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the charge’. If an award fails to achieve vindication, it fails properly to compensate and restore the status quo ante.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In assessing damages, the court takes account of all the relevant facts, and in particular the gravity of the defamation, the extent of its publication, and evidence of the harm it has done. The award must in the end be no more than is justified by the legitimate aim of protecting reputation, necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of that aim, and proportionate to that need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Injunctive relief&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Injunctive relief is regularly afforded to successful defamation claimants, to restrain the publication of the same or similar libel. Final injunctive relief, restraining publication post-judgment, is distinctively different from pre-trial interim relief, since the implication of the judgment is necessarily that the published libel is not a species of free speech protected by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Nicklin J’s observation about permanent, post-judgment, injunction in Lachauxat [239] was that ‘it is the natural remedy that flows from the Court’s decision’, and, in the absence of satisfactory undertakings, it may be necessary to injunct further publication to give full effect to that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, importantly, it remains a discretionary remedy. It is not available as of right. In considering whether to exercise its discretion, and if so how, a court will have regard to all the circumstances of a case, including the conduct of the parties, and will focus in particular on assessing the risk of repetition of the defamation should injunctive relief not be granted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Order for publication of judgment summary&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Section 12 of the Defamation Act 2013 provides as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Power of court to order a summary of its judgment to be published&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Where a court gives judgment for the claimant in an action for defamation the court may order the defendant to publish a summary of the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The wording of any summary and the time, manner, form and place of its publication are to be for the parties to agree.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the parties cannot agree on the wording, the wording is to be settled by the court.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(4)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the parties cannot agree on the time, manner, form or place of publication, the court may give such directions as to those matters as it considers reasonable and practicable in the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(5)…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As confirmed by Monir v Wood at [239]-[242], the power to order publication of a judgment summary is itself a distinct incursion into a defendant’s rights to freedom of expression, protected by Article 10 of the ECHR, and must be exercised mindfully of that. The incursion involved must be justified by reference to the legitimate aim of protecting reputation, and necessary and proportionate to that aim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantum of damages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most significant relevant factors in the present case seem to me to be these.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, there is the gravity of the libellous allegations in this case which, in multiple and detailed respects, profoundly impugn Dr Garrett’s personal integrity, social standing and professional credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, there is the fact that they were published from websites regarded as authoritative and reliable, and repeatedly, to the very audience – including the free software community in England – in which Dr Garrett’s reputation here is most deeply invested, and which has the highest capacity to think the worse of him as a result. This was a substantial audience estimated to be of the order of at least thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, there is the fact that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz have insisted on the truth of their allegations all the way to trial, have offered no evidence for it, have refused to take down the material complained of and have made no retraction of or apology for the content. They appear to have thought that this was a point of journalistic principle and integrity, but they do not appear to have engaged in that capacity with the need or desirability for doing more, when faced with Dr Garrett’s assurances that he had nothing to do with the sockpuppet accounts, than simply dismissing them as probable lies. Mrs Schestowitz did however, in her closing submissions at trial, offer Dr Garrett an apology to the extent of having hurt his feelings. I thought that was at least well-intentioned and genuine, and I give her credit for it. I note also that, while Dr Schestowitz challenged Dr Garrett hard in a range of matters under cross-examination, he did so courteously and without directly maintaining the underlying truth of the content of the allegations beyond those of his responsibility for the trolling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, I note Dr Garrett’s evidence that the libels have caused him to fear for his professional and academic reputation, for the security of his employment and for his future employment prospects. He has had experience of being approached directly by a colleague and a former colleague over the content of the publications and had to defend himself, and has suffered the natural anxiety and humiliation of wondering what others are thinking of him and whether he may be being avoided or overlooked for opportunities because of what has been said about him. I bear in mind also that he does not suggest there is evidence to date that he has suffered actual employment detriment, and I note the strength of his professional reputation and the extent to which that might be able in itself to be robust to the depredations of gossip and rumour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr Hamer asks for a single global sum to vindicate Dr Garrett’s reputation and compensate him for distress in relation to all the publications complained of. He proposed a range of comparator decisions for my consideration, in support of a submission that libel damages approaching £100,000 would be appropriate. I have considered these. I noted in particular the case of Fentiman v Marsh [2019] EWHC 2099 in which an award of £55,000 was made in respect of allegations in a blog read by about 500 people that the claimant, a company CEO, was a hacker responsible for illegal cyber-attacks on a company. The tone of the allegations there were something comparable to those in the present case – somewhat personally and floridly put. I hold the effects of inflation in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my judgment, in all these circumstances, the minimum sum necessary to convince a fair-minded bystander of the baselessness of the allegations against him, to vindicate his reputation and restore his standing, and to compensate him for the consequences he has suffered, is £70,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Injunctive Relief&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz continue to publish and republish the libels. They have no entitlement to do so. This is not a form of freedom of expression which is protected by law. They have published further similar defamatory statements since the commencement of these proceedings. In the absence of any indication that they will voluntarily desist, remove the material objected to, and give satisfactory undertakings not to repeat the same or similar allegations, they face being compelled to do so by means of an injunction enforceable by proceedings for contempt of court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Section 12 Order&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A principal consideration in deciding whether to exercise the discretion to compel publication of a summary of a libel judgment is whether it is likely to be effective in coming to the attention of those to whom the original libel was published, and therefore in undoing its original reputational harm and vindicating the claimant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publication of a short summary of this judgment on Techrights and Tuxmachines would, in my view, be likely to be effective in reaching the UK audience to which the libels were published. It would be a clear statement to the free software community here that Dr Garrett cannot be regarded as having any stain on his character arising out of the accusations carried by those websites and complained of in these proceedings. That would, in my judgment, be a necessary and proportionate means of vindicating and protecting his reputation and rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decision&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett’s claim in defamation succeeds. He is entitled to the vindication of this judgment, and to the remedies I have indicated. The counterclaim of Dr and Mrs Schestowitz in harassment is dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz experienced appalling anonymous abuse, threats and harassment online. They reacted by using their websites – well-established, respected and trusted in the free software community, and carrying their own personal authority as free software activists – to blame and upbraid Dr Garrett for being responsible for this, and to vilify him accordingly. They have been unable to establish any recognisable basis in law for doing so. They have advanced no evidence for it; I was shown nothing in these proceedings capable of establishing in a court of law that Dr Garrett was in fact responsible or had anything to do with it. Their own campaign of allegations is not in these circumstances a lawful exercise of free speech, much less an example of investigative journalism. It is unsubstantiated character assassination and it must stop.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Firefox 147 Will Support The XDG Base Directory Specification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; A 21 year old bug report requesting support of the XDG Base Directory specification is finally being addressed by Firefox. The Firefox 147 release should respect this XDG specification around where files should be positioned within Linux users' home directory. &lt;lb/&gt;The XDG Base Directory specification lays out where application data files, configuration files, cached assets, and other files and file formats should be positioned within a user's home directory and the XDG environment variables for accessing those locations. To date Firefox has just positioned all files under ~/.mozilla rather than the likes of ~/.config and ~/.local/share.&lt;lb/&gt;Back in September 2004 this bug report was opened to support the FreeDesktop.org XDG Base Directory specification.&lt;lb/&gt;Merged this morning was the support for this specification and associated commits.&lt;lb/&gt;In turn this long-open bug is now closed and Firefox 147 should be the version to finally support the XDG Base Directory specification for jiving more nicely with other Linux apps.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;210 IQ is not enough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Going as Former Gifted Child for Halloween and the whole costume is just gonna be people asking “What are you supposed to be?” And me saying “I was supposed to be a lot of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Christopher Langan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chris Langan became famous when television networks interviewed him for allegedly scoring ~170 on an IQ test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Langan has not produced any acclaimed works of art or science. In this way, he differs significantly from outsider intellectuals like Paul Erdös, Stephen Wolfram, Nassim Taleb, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wolfram's theory of everything is incomprehensible in a fun way. Langan's theory of everything is incomprehensible in a not-fun way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Langan is clearly a smart guy. He probably cleared 140+ on an IQ test. He speaks like a book. He won $250,000 on a major trivia show.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seriously, I really wish I could speak as clearly and confidently as Langan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe that's why this interview breaks my heart. The resentment, the eugenics, the hubris -- Langan earned a reputation as "Alex Jones with a thesaurus" and "the Steven Seagal of intellectuals".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't want you to hate this guy. Yes, he actively promotes poisonous rhetoric -- ignore that for now. This is about you. Reflect on all your setbacks, your unmet potential, and the raw unfairness of it all. It sucks, and you mustn't let that bitterness engulf you. You can forgive history itself; you can practice gratitude towards an unjust world. You need no credentials, nor awards, nor secrets, nor skills to do so. You are allowed to like yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Langan had a rough childhood:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Langan's biological father left before he was born, and is said to have died in Mexico. Langan's mother married three more times, and had a son by each husband. Her second husband was murdered, and her third killed himself. Langan grew up with the fourth husband Jack Langan, who has been described as a "failed journalist" who used a bullwhip as a disciplinary measure and went on drinking sprees, disappearing from the house, locking the kitchen cabinets so the four boys could not get to the food in them. The family was very poor; Langan recalls that they all had only one set of clothes each. The family moved around, living for a while in a teepee on an Indian reservation, then later in Virginia City, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trauma never excuses nasty behavior, and that's not the point. This is still about you. You can learn about yourself through others' stories, and empathy is scariest when you confront similar nastiness within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will never have enough IQ, nor money, nor time, nor energy. It's no excuse. You are enough -- no, no, you are plenty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kim Ung-yong&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of competing in real games, some people construct insignificant/winnable sub-games. These people are called "scrubs". They want to compete, but they cannot bear losing; they want to win, but they are too risk-averse and too undisciplined to excel in fair play. People who commit to such worthless/unwinnable games are called "losers".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you forget that participation is optional. You perpetually sear your bespoke definition of "success" directly onto your forehead. You've been enduring your pain for so long that you can't remember how it feels to be free from expectation, from ambition, from guilt, from inferiority, from -- no, you don't have to do any of this. You may do whatever you want, and you may do whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to his parents, Kim Ung-yong started calculus at age 3, scored 210 on an IQ test and started studying physics at Hanyang University at age 4, spoke five languages by age 5, and received an invitation to work at NASA by age 7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010, this is how Kim reflected on his childhood:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At that time, I led my life like a machine--I woke up, solved the daily assigned equation, ate, slept, and so forth. I really didn't know what I was doing, and I was lonely and had no friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an adult, Kim deliberately chose pragmatism over abstraction. He studied civil engineering. He worked as a middle-manager in the Compensation Department at Chungbuk Development Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim Ung-yong rejected the title of "failed genius":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to tell people that I'm happy the way I am. But why do people have to call my happiness a failure? […] Some think that high IQ people can be omnipotent, but that's not true. Look at me, I don't have musical talent nor do I excel at sports. […] Society shouldn't judge anyone with unilateral standards – everyone has different learning levels, hopes, talents and dreams and we should respect that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2014, Kim joined Chungbuk National University as an associate professor. In 2020, he donated 15,000 books from his personal collection to Uijeongbu City for public use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is still about you. There exist no certificates nor trophies nor titles that can quench your thirst for permanence. If you worship human intelligence, 210 IQ is not enough. It is only plenty if you let it be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Nano Banana Pro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a few months ago we released Nano Banana, our Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model. From restoring old photos to generating mini figurines, Nano Banana was a big step in image editing that empowered casual creators to express their creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image), our new state-of-the art image generation and editing model. Built on Gemini 3 Pro, Nano Banana Pro uses Gemini’s state-of-the-art reasoning and real-world knowledge to visualize information better than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Nano Banana Pro helps you bring any idea or design to life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nano Banana Pro can help you visualize any idea and design anything - from prototypes, to representing data as infographics, to turning handwritten notes into diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Nano Banana Pro, now you can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generate more accurate, context-rich visuals based on enhanced reasoning, world knowledge and real-time information&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Gemini 3’s advanced reasoning, Nano Banana Pro doesn’t just create beautiful images, it also helps you create more helpful content. You can get accurate educational explainers to learn more about a new subject, like context-rich infographics and diagrams based on the content you provide or facts from the real world. Nano Banana Pro can also connect to Google Search's vast knowledge base to help you create a quick snapshot for a recipe or visualize real-time information like weather or sports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An infographic of the common house plant, String of Turtles, with information on origins, care essentials and growth patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Create an infographic about this plant focusing on interesting information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step-by-step infographic for making Elaichi Chai (cardamom tea), demonstrating the ability to visualize recipes and real-world information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Create an infographic that shows how to make elaichi chai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used Nano Banana Pro to pull in real-time weather via Search grounding to build a pop-art infographic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generate better visuals with more accurate, legible text directly in the image in multiple languages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nano Banana Pro is the best model for creating images with correctly rendered and legible text directly in the image, whether you’re looking for a short tagline, or a long paragraph. Gemini 3 is great at understanding depth and nuance, which unlocks a world of possibilities with image editing and generation - especially with text. Now you can create more detailed text in mockups or posters with a wider variety of textures, fonts and calligraphy. With Gemini’s enhanced multilingual reasoning, you can generate text in multiple languages, or localize and translate your content so you can scale internationally and/or share content more easily with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A black and white storyboard sketch showing an establishing shot, medium shot, close-up, and POV shot for a film scene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Create a storyboard for this scene&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: View of a cozy street in Berlin on a bright sunny day, stark shadows. the old houses are oddly shaped like letters that spell out "BERLIN" Colored in Blue, Red, White and black. The houses still look like houses and the resemblance to letters is subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calligraphy inspired by meaning, showcasing the ability to generate expressive text with a wider variety of textures and fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: make 8 minimalistic logos, each is an expressive word, and make letters convey a message or sound visually to express the meaning of this word in a dramatic way. composition: flat vector rendering of all logos in black on a single white background&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A beverage campaign concept showcasing accurate translation and rendering of English text into Korean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: translate all the English text on the three yellow and blue cans into Korean, while keeping everything else the same&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A graphic design featuring the word 'TYPOGRAPHY' with a retro, screen-printed texture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: A vibrant, eye-catching "TYPOGRAPHY" design on a textured off-white background. The letters are bold, blocky, extra condensed and create a 3D effect with overlapping layers of bright blue and hot pink, each with a halftone dot pattern, evoking a retro print aesthetic. 16:9 aspect ratio&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blending text and texture in a creative way by integrating the phrase into a woodchopping scene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Create an image showing the phrase "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood" made out of wood chucked by a woodchuck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create high-fidelity visuals with upgraded creative capabilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consistency by design: With Nano Banana Pro, you can blend more elements than ever before, using up to 14 images and maintaining the consistency and resemblance of up to 5 people. Whether turning sketches into products or blueprints into photorealistic 3D structures, you can now bridge the gap between concept and creation. Apply your desired visual look and feel to your mockups with ease, ensuring your branding remains seamless and consistent across every touchpoint.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining the consistency of up to 14 inputs, including multiple characters, across a complex composition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: A medium shot of the 14 fluffy characters sitting squeezed together side-by-side on a worn beige fabric sofa and on the floor. They are all facing forwards, watching a vintage, wooden-boxed television set placed on a low wooden table in front of the sofa. The room is dimly lit, with warm light from a window on the left and the glow from the TV illuminating the creatures' faces and fluffy textures. The background is a cozy, slightly cluttered living room with a braided rug, a bookshelf with old books, and rustic kitchen elements in the background. The overall atmosphere is warm, cozy, and amused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Craft lifestyle scenes by combining multiple elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Combine these images into one appropriately arranged cinematic image in 16:9 format and change the dress on the mannequin to the dress in the image&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create surreal landscapes by combining multiple input elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Combine these images into one appropriately arranged cinematic image in 16:9 format&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A high-fashion editorial shot set in a desert landscape that maintains the consistency and resemblance of the people from the 6 input photos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Put these five people and this dog into a single image, they should fit into a stunning award-winning shot in the style if [sic] a fashion editorial. The identity of all five people and their attire and the dog must stay consistent throughout but they can and should be seen from different angles and distances in [sic] as is most natural and suitable to the scene. Make the colour and lighting look natural on them all, they look like they naturally fit into this fashion show.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Studio-quality creative controls: With Nano Banana Pro's new capabilities we are putting advanced creative controls directly into your hands. Select, refine and transform any part of an image with improved localized editing. Adjust camera angles, change the focus and apply sophisticated color grading, or even transform scene lighting (e.g. changing day to night or creating a bokeh effect). Your creations are ready for any platform, from social media to print, thanks to a range of available aspect ratios and available 2K and 4K resolution&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change the look and feel of an image for a range of platforms by adapting the aspect ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: change aspect ratio to 1:1 by reducing background. The character, remains exactly locked in its current position&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lighting and focus controls applied to transform a scene from day to night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Turn this scene into nighttime&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obscure or enlighten a section of your image with lighting controls to achieve specific dramatic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Prompt: Generate an image with an intense chiaroscuro effect. The man should retain his original features and expression. Introduce harsh, directional light, appearing to come from above and slightly to the left, casting deep, defined shadows across the face. Only slivers of light illuminating his eyes and cheekbones, the rest of the face is in deep shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bring out the details of your composition by adjusting the depth of field or focal point (e.g., focusing on the flowers).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Focus on the flowers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How you can try Nano Banana Pro today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across our products and services, you now have a choice: the original Nano Banana for fast, fun editing, or Nano Banana Pro for complex compositions requiring the highest quality and visually sophisticated results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consumers and students: Rolling out globally in the Gemini app when you select ‘Create images’ with the ‘Thinking’ model. Our free-tier users will receive limited free quotas, after which they will revert to the original Nano Banana model. Google AI Plus, Pro and Ultra subscribers receive higher quotas. For AI Mode in Search, Nano Banana Pro is available in the U.S. for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. For NotebookLM, Nano Banana Pro is also available for subscribers globally.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Professionals: We're upgrading image generation in Google Ads to Nano Banana Pro to put cutting-edge creative and editing power directly into the hands of advertisers globally. It’s also rolling out starting today to Workspace customers in Google Slides and Vids.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Developers and enterprise: Starting to roll out in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, and in Google Antigravity to create rich UX layouts &amp;amp; mockups; enterprises can start building in Vertex AI for scaled creation today and it’s coming soon to Gemini Enterprise.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creatives: Starting to roll out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in Flow, our AI filmmaking tool, to give creatives, filmmakers and marketers even more precision and control over their frames and scenes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to identify AI-generated images in the Gemini app&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe it’s critical to know when an image is AI-generated. This is why all media generated by Google’s tools are embedded with our imperceptible SynthID digital watermark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we are putting a powerful verification tool directly in consumers’ hands: you can now upload an image into the Gemini app and simply ask if it was generated by Google AI, thanks to SynthID technology. We are starting with images, but will expand to audio and video soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to SynthID, we will maintain a visible watermark (the Gemini sparkle) on images generated by free and Google AI Pro tier users, to make images even more easy to detect as Google AI-generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognizing the need for a clean visual canvas for professional work, we will remove the visible watermark from images generated by Google AI Ultra subscribers and within the Google AI Studio developer tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find out more about how we’re increasing transparency in AI content with SynthID in our blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
