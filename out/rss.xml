    &lt;p&gt;Slip it into your pocket, power it on, and your UniFi network follows you wherever you land. No reconfiguring, no rethinking, just the same environment you trust, now mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wherever you arrive, your network identity comes with you. Location aware policies, routing rules, and WiFi broadcasts light up the moment the router connects, giving you continuity instead of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bring your UniFi gear and the tools you already rely on. The moment they power up, everything links together as if it never left home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Travel Router may be compact, but it is engineered for flexibility. Ethernet, WiFi, or 5G connections via USB can all serve as uplinks, while captive portal logins on hotel networks are handled quietly in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Travel light, stay connected, and keep your UniFi experience no matter where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The e-scooter isn’t new – London was zooming around on Autopeds a century ago&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The e-scooters that clutter up pavements may seem like a new thing, but a hundred years ago, there were already people zooming around London on powered scooters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These were the Autoped, an American import that was once popular enough to regularly appear in the newspapers before vanishing seemingly without a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invented in the USA in 1915, they first appeared in London in 1917, despite a ban on imports during WWI, and really took off when the import ban was lifted in 1919.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By today’s standards, they look like a bargain, selling for just £36, although that’s actually about £1,600 in today’s money, so they were really aimed at the wealthy buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gamage’s, the people’s emporium, described them as being made for everybody who feels the necessity of making the most of time, of conserving health and energy, and keeping travelling expenses down to the minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was said to be able to reach speeds of 10mph, and unlike modern versions, the Autoped was powered by petrol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(There was apparently an electric version by Eveready, but it might have been only in the USA)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For comfort over rough roads, they were fitted with 15-inch-diameter pneumatic tyres. The Lady magazine suggested the Autoped would make for a more suitable alternative to the motorbike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They even played a key role in a silent movie, At Sword’s Point, about an annoying man who refuses to say no when rebuffed by a lady and, when trying to escape the relatives, steals an Autoped but collides with his pursuer, also on an Autoped. An “explosion followed, and they both disappeared”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His Majesty’s government wasn’t going to be left behind either, and there was a report in the Pall Mall Gazette of a “distinguished looking autopedist, gracefully erect” sweeping down Whitehall delivering parcels to 10 Downing Street.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;American Miss Shirley Kellogg brings new motor scooter invention to England. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, by 1922, the adverts aren’t by Gammages, but by owners selling them off cheaply in the classified ads. Several noted that the owners were switching to a car instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that the British weather might have killed off the Autoped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But finally, to that famous image of a lady on an Autoped – it’s of Lady Florence Priscilla Norman, a noted suffragist and was given the Autoped by her husband, the Liberal MP, Henry Norman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just think, had the Autoped lingered on for a few more years and become more affordable as manufacturing increased, how different the streets of our cities could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many startups eventually gravitate towards enterprise customers for bigger tickets and long-term contracts. As enterprise customers start using your product, they soon demand advanced permission systems to manage their different user roles and access levels. A naive implementation of permission checks works perfectly fine at first, but as they use your platform more and more, the amount of data, users, and relationships will put that implementation to the test. Soon your biggest paying customer will be threatening to churn because your app is just too slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate this problem, I've set up a simple example. Imagine an app with folders and files where an admin can see all folders and files, but standard users can only see files and folders they've created or that have been shared with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Naive Approach (read-time permission queries)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your first intuition will be to query the database on every request to calculate the permissions and the data that the user can access. First, you check the role of the user: is the user an admin or a standard user? If the user is not an admin, then query for all the resources the user has created or that have been shared with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first part is straightforward: if you are an admin, return all resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const user = await sqlQueryOne(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?`, [
  userId,
]);

// Admin: Fetch all resources
if (user.type === "admin") {
  return await sqlQuery(`SELECT * FROM resources`);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For standard users, you need to query for resources created by them. If the resource is a folder, you will have access to all of its descendants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const accessibleResources = [];

const ownedResources = await sqlQuery(
  `SELECT * FROM resources WHERE owner_id = ?`,
  [userId],
);

// For each owned resource, fetch descendants recursively
for (const resource of ownedResources) {
  accessibleResources.push(resource);

  const descendants = await sqlQuery(
    `
    WITH RECURSIVE tree AS (
      SELECT id FROM resources WHERE parent_id = ?
      UNION ALL
      SELECT r.id FROM resources r JOIN tree t ON r.parent_id = t.id
    )
    SELECT r.* FROM resources r JOIN tree t ON r.id = t.id
  `,
    [resource.id],
  );
  accessibleResources.push(...descendants);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can already see recursive queries appearing. As we own more resources with deeper nesting, the queries will get slower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we include all shared resources, their descendants if a folder was shared, plus their ancestors to show the full path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const sharedResources = await sqlQuery(
  `
  SELECT r.*
  FROM shares s
  JOIN resources r ON s.resource_id = r.id
  WHERE s.user_id = ?
`,
  [userId],
);

// For each shared resource, fetch ancestors and descendants
for (const resource of sharedResources) {
  accessibleResources.push(resource);

  // Query ancestors to show full path
  const ancestors = await sqlQuery(
    `
    WITH RECURSIVE ancestors AS (
      SELECT parent_id FROM resources WHERE id = ?
      UNION ALL
      SELECT r.parent_id FROM resources r JOIN ancestors a ON r.id = a.parent_id
      WHERE r.parent_id IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT r.* FROM resources r JOIN ancestors a ON r.id = a.parent_id
  `,
    [resource.id],
  );
  accessibleResources.push(...ancestors);

  // Another query for descendants of each shared resource
  const descendants = await sqlQuery(
    `
    WITH RECURSIVE tree AS (
      SELECT id FROM resources WHERE parent_id = ?
      UNION ALL
      SELECT r.id FROM resources r JOIN tree t ON r.parent_id = t.id
    )
    SELECT r.* FROM resources r JOIN tree t ON r.id = t.id
  `,
    [resource.id],
  );
  accessibleResources.push(...descendants);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code is easy to follow, but the number of queries—especially recursive ones with nested folder structures—will quickly become a bottleneck as you scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;RBAC (write-time permission queries)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because we normally develop apps that read more than they write, it makes sense to optimize for reads. What does this look like? With Role Based Access Control we store the pre-computed permissions in the database, linking users with resources:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- RBAC: Pre-computed permissions
-- access_type: 'owner' (full control), 'shared' (read only), 'path_only' (visible but no access)
CREATE TABLE permissions (
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  resource_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  access_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, resource_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (resource_id) REFERENCES resources(id)
);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, when querying for resources, we can simply do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const resources = await sqlQuery(
  `SELECT r.* FROM resources r
   JOIN permissions p ON r.id = p.resource_id
   WHERE p.user_id = ?`,
  [userId],
);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it! No recursive queries, no multiple queries, just a simple join. It's as fast as it gets, and easy to index too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's see how to maintain the permissions table. On every new resource, we need to grant the owner full access:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;await sqlRun(
  `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO permissions (user_id, resource_id, access_type) VALUES (?, ?, 'owner')`,
  [ownerId, resourceId],
);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was easy, but some more complex logic is needed when sharing resources:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Add the shared resource itself with 'shared' access
await sqlRun(
  `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO permissions (user_id, resource_id, access_type) VALUES (?, ?, 'shared')`,
  [userId, resourceId],
);

// Add ancestors for path visibility (path_only - no actual access)
const ancestorIds = await getAncestorIds(resourceId);
for (const ancestorId of ancestorIds) {
  await sqlRun(
    `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO permissions (user_id, resource_id, access_type) VALUES (?, ?, 'path_only')`,
    [userId, ancestorId],
  );
}

// Add all descendants with 'shared' access
const descendantIds = await getDescendantIds(resourceId);
for (const descId of descendantIds) {
  await sqlRun(
    `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO permissions (user_id, resource_id, access_type) VALUES (?, ?, 'shared')`,
    [userId, descId],
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can clearly see the trade-off here: we moved the complexity from read-time to write-time. Every time a resource is created or shared, we need to update the permissions table accordingly. We added a point of failure, as the permissions table can get out of sync with the actual data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-world example: PostHog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Although this is a simple example, while browsing the PostHog source code I found the exact same approach. They have an &lt;code&gt;AccessControl&lt;/code&gt;
            model that stores pre-computed permissions:
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# PostHog: ee/models/rbac/access_control.py
class AccessControl(models.Model):
    team = models.ForeignKey("posthog.Team", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    access_level = models.CharField(max_length=32)  # 'none', 'viewer', 'editor'
    resource = models.CharField(max_length=32)      # 'dashboard', 'feature_flag', etc.
    resource_id = models.CharField(null=True)       # null = all, UUID = specific object

    # Can be scoped to a user or a role
    organization_member = models.ForeignKey(..., null=True)
    role = models.ForeignKey("Role", null=True)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When listing resources, they simply filter the queryset based on these pre-computed permissions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# PostHog: posthog/rbac/user_access_control.py
def filter_queryset_by_access_level(self, queryset, ...):
    # Get pre-computed access controls from cache
    access_controls = self._get_access_controls(filters)

    # Build sets of allowed/blocked resource IDs
    for access_control in access_controls:
        if access_control.access_level != NO_ACCESS_LEVEL:
            allowed_resource_ids.add(access_control.resource_id)
        else:
            blocked_resource_ids.add(access_control.resource_id)

    # Filter queryset - no recursive queries needed!
    return queryset.filter(id__in=allowed_resource_ids)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also cache the access controls during a request to avoid repeated database lookups:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# PostHog: posthog/rbac/user_access_control.py
def _get_access_controls(self, filters):
    key = json.dumps(filters, sort_keys=True)
    if key not in self._cache:
        self._cache[key] = list(AccessControl.objects.filter(...))
    return self._cache[key]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern is clear: pre-compute permissions at write-time, store them in a dedicated table, and filter with simple lookups at read-time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What about ABAC?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you research ways to implement permission systems, you will often find Attribute-Based Access Control as a recommended approach. ABAC is great when you need to make complex decisions on whether a user can access a specific resource or not. Figma showed how they handle permissions, and this is an example of ABAC in action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main difference from our naive approach is that ABAC offers a declarative way of defining the rules and policies behind the permission checks. The engine will convert those policies into queries and code to execute them at read-time. Here is an example of how those rules could look for our example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Rule 1: Admins can access everything
allow if {
    input.user.type == "admin"
}

# Rule 2: Owners can access their resources
allow if {
    input.resource.owner_id == input.user.id
}

# Rule 3: Users can access resources shared with them
allow if {
    some share in data.shares
    share.resource_id == input.resource.id
    share.user_id == input.user.id
}

# ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach is very clear and composable. It works great for single-resource access checks: "can user X access resource Y?" It struggles when listing resources, as we would need to execute the policies for each resource and can't directly query the resources table with simple filters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Optimizing for hierarchical data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both approaches still rely on recursive queries to traverse the folder hierarchy. In SaaS applications with deeply nested structures, these recursive queries can also become a bottleneck. There are two common patterns to eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Materialized paths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple alternative is storing the full path as a string column on each resource.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN path TEXT;

-- Example paths:
-- /1/           (root folder, id=1)
-- /1/5/         (child of root, id=5)
-- /1/5/12/      (grandchild, id=12)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding descendants becomes a prefix search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// All descendants of resource with path '/1/5/'
const descendants = await sqlQuery(
  `SELECT * FROM resources WHERE path LIKE ?`,
  [resource.path + "%"],
);

// All ancestors by parsing the path
const ancestorIds = resource.path.split("/").filter(Boolean);
const ancestors = await sqlQuery(
  `SELECT * FROM resources WHERE id IN (${ancestorIds.join(",")})`,
);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Materialized paths are easier to implement but can be tricky when moving resources between folders, as you need to update the path of all descendants. Closure tables handle moves more gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Closure tables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A closure table pre-computes all ancestor-descendant relationships. Instead of traversing the tree at query time, you store every possible path—another trade-off between read and write times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE resource_closure (
  ancestor_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  descendant_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  depth INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (ancestor_id, descendant_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (ancestor_id) REFERENCES resources(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (descendant_id) REFERENCES resources(id)
);

-- /1/           (root folder, id=1)
INSERT INTO resource_closure VALUES (1, 1, 0);

-- /1/5/         (child of root, id=5)
INSERT INTO resource_closure VALUES (5, 5, 0);
INSERT INTO resource_closure VALUES (1, 5, 1);

-- /1/5/12/      (grandchild, id=12)
INSERT INTO resource_closure VALUES (12, 12, 0);
INSERT INTO resource_closure VALUES (5, 12, 1);
INSERT INTO resource_closure VALUES (1, 12, 2);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this table, finding all descendants becomes a simple join with no recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// All descendants of a resource (instant lookup)
const descendants = await sqlQuery(
  `SELECT r.* FROM resources r
   JOIN resource_closure c ON r.id = c.descendant_id
   WHERE c.ancestor_id = ? AND c.depth &amp;gt; 0`,
  [resourceId],
);

// All ancestors of a resource (for showing the path)
const ancestors = await sqlQuery(
  `SELECT r.* FROM resources r
   JOIN resource_closure c ON r.id = c.ancestor_id
   WHERE c.descendant_id = ? AND c.depth &amp;gt; 0
   ORDER BY c.depth DESC`,
  [resourceId],
);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trade-off is write complexity. When creating a resource, you must insert closure entries for all ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// When creating a new resource under parentId
await sqlRun(
  `INSERT INTO resource_closure (ancestor_id, descendant_id, depth)
   SELECT ancestor_id, ?, depth + 1
   FROM resource_closure
   WHERE descendant_id = ?
   UNION ALL
   SELECT ?, ?, 0`,
  [newResourceId, parentId, newResourceId, newResourceId],
);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core trade-off is clear: you can pay the cost at read-time with recursive queries, or at write-time by maintaining a permissions index. Starting with the naive approach makes sense it's simpler to implement and debug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when your enterprise customers start experiencing slow load times, the RBAC approach becomes worth the added complexity. The performance difference is significant enough that it can eliminate the need for other workarounds like aggressive caching or complex pagination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main risk with pre-computed permissions is data getting out of sync. Plan for this by building a rebuild script from day one that can recompute all permissions from the source of truth. When bugs happen, and they will, you'll be glad you have it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Avoid Mini-frameworks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I work in Google Ads infrastructure in the past four years. Over time, I've seen one pattern came along again and again, causing endless pain for developers, that is, creating mini-frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is mini-framework?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I'd like to give readers a sense of what I mean by "mini-frameworks". Imagine a company that has 1000 engineers, and they share the same tech stack. Over time, a team finds the shared tech stack unsatisfactory, either because they have to write boilerplate code over and over, or the performance is not good enough, or whatever. So they decided to create their own framework on top of the shared stack. You know it's a framework and not just a library, when you hear engineers present the work using concepts they invented, as a way to actualize their mental model. Framework like this is what I called "mini-framework", with some common characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Created by a small number of team(s) to solve their pain points&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wraps around the company/org-shared tech stack or framework&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Introduce new concepts that doesn't exist in the original stack&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creators claim that the framework "magically" solves many problems, and push more people to use it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you work for a big company, most likely you've seen or even done this. But why is it bad? Being a victim myself, I can share my story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, my team has been using a Google-internal framework to write distributed programs, and are gradually migrating our org's codebase onto it. This framework is well-designed and maintained by a dedicated team. We're generally happy with it, though it has some itchy points (not pain points). Being a strong and ambitious engineer, my manager proposed that we add an abstraction layer on top of it, with the aim to lower the barrier for org adoption, and solve those itchy points on the way. I was skeptical and tried convincing my manager not to do it, but failed. Eventually, several engineers spent quarters to add this abstraction layer, and now the fun begins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, one author tried to adopt it in our existing codebase. People thought it would be easy, but it took like a year. Why? Because during the migration, they found that the abstraction cannot handle certain use cases, so they have to spend time patching it to make it work. In the meantime, other people like me were writing new code using the original framework, this again added new requirements and workload for migration. Eventually, after spending way more time than initially planned, the migration completed, and my manager decided that newly-written code should use our own framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You think this is the end? Of course not!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I started writing code with the new framework, there wasn't a single time that I didn't want to curse and quit the job. The framework is so hard to use, it introduced so many concepts with the intent to hide complexity, but ended up bringing more. Since I'm not the person who writes it, I'm not familiar with all tricks and hacks. As a result, what used to cost me a day to finish can now take two weeks, plus I have to constantly ask the author how to do certain things, and even booked pair-programming sessions. As I heard, other team members were having the same complaints. As for the original goal of driving adoption, ofc it didn't help (if not slower). What's funny is that, this layer is supposed to make people outside of our team write code more easily, but now even our own team are suffering from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking back, part of the problem was caused by bad design and implementation, but the fundamental problem lies in creating the mini-framework in the first place. I've observed other mini-frameworks, they all sort of have the same problem, just some worse than the others. So I've come up with a few thoughts to explain why mini-frameworks are bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why mini-frameworks are bad?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, mini-frameworks lacks feature completeness and compatibility. People often think that they can magically "hide the unnecessary complexity", but in reality they can't. Even if the mini-framework can deal with 80% use cases well, they often lack the flexibility and features from the original framework to satisfy the rest 20%. DSL (Domain Specific Language) shares the same problem, and that's why people hate it so much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, mini-frameworks violates the ETC (Easier To Change) principle. I first learned the concept from the legendary book The Pragmatic Programmer, and it still astonishes me that many programmers (even experienced ones) are not aware of it. Put simply, it suggests to write code in a way that allows future modifications be made easily. Creating mini-frameworks violates this principle in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The mini-framework only models the current use cases to solve certain problems. When requirements change in the future, it often cannot keep up with it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creating mini-framework often requires poking into the implementation details of the original framework, and those details were abstracted away for good reason: they can change at any time. The more implementation details that are relied upon, the harder for the maintaining team to evolve the original framework.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, mini-frameworks is a realization of the creator's mental model, but it's not everyone's mental model. People who tend to create mini-framework are often more opinionated, which is a good thing by itself. But when you create things for others to use, too opinionated can be a bad thing. I would even say that sometimes (not always), creating a mini framework directly reflects the author's ego, and they chose a framework because a tiny library don't recognize the "significance of the work".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, mini-frameworks tend to cause tech stack fragmentation. I generated an image to show what I mean: part of the system is migrated, others are not. As new layers kept being added, over time it gets worse. Not sure if other companies are like this, but at Google, I've never actually seen a code migration fully complete, which is kinda hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last but also the most concerning: lack of maintenance. Unlike shared infrastructure owned by dedicated teams, mini-frameworks were often owned by those 1 or 2 people who created it. Once they left the team or company, it becomes really hard to find successors — sure other team members may know roughly how things work, but certainly not as deep as the authors. Also, people lack the motivation to maintain existing stuff, because you don't get paid more or promoted doing this. Therefore, mini frameworks often die with the departure of the original authors, unless it has gained major adoption before that, which happens less likely than not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So, What Should You Do Instead?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, it's important to clarify what I'm against and what I'm not. I'm certainly not against adding abstractions——because abstractions are essentially, the program itself, we can't live without it. I'm against adding abstractions in a wrong way, and in the form that's not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me bring this up once again since it's really important: The real and only difference between a library and a framework, is whether it introduces new concepts. The line can be blurry sometimes, but more often you can tell easily. For example, a library can include a set of subclasses or utility functions around the original framework, as they don't introduce new concepts. But if you see a README that starts with a "Glossary" section, you know it's 99.99% chance a framework (people may still refer to them as "libraries", but you get the idea).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My point is, we should be really really careful introducing new concepts. If you can, avoid it. The cognitive load brought by a bunch of buzz words is heavier than people realized, and especially, what the framework author can realize. Words are the mirror of someone's thought, same with code. The authors create concepts because it is how they model the problem inside their brain, it is how they think. That's why they claim the concepts are "natural and straightforward", while others are struggling to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So rule No.1, avoid creating mini-frameworks, create libraries instead. But in the cases where you do find it necessary to create a framework, my suggestions are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Link concepts to concrete business requirements, not something in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start fresh. Don't build a wrapper around the existing framework, build your own from scratch. Yes this would make it a major decision that requires more discussions and resources, but it avoids many of the aforementioned issues. After all, you have good business justification to do this, right.. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Take it seriously. Having seen many disasters caused by mini-frameworks, I can't help thinking if it's because people didn't take it seriously enough. My feeling is that, since people don't really understand the distinction between a library and a framework, both the initiator and reviewers of the decision tend to underthink it: "Oh it's just another abstraction, we do that all the time". As my story shows, it's really not. Creating and adopting a framework, whether mini or not, is always a serious decision, thus should be treated that way. By realizing the seriousness of this matter, I hope we can avoid making rashy decisions to create mini-frameworks that should not exist in the first place.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; My current laptop is an aging X1 Carbon generation 7, purchased some time in mid 2019. A few months ago a few keys of the keyboard stopped working, specifically the 5, 6, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and Delete keys. Sometimes I can get it working again by
mashing one of them for a while, but it's not consistent. Given my past
experiences with X1 Carbon laptops breaking outside of warranty and the
frustration that comes with replacing their components, I decided it was time to
look for a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, buying a new X1 Carbon wasn't going to be an option: when it comes to displays you now basically have two choices: a subpar not-quite-2K IPS display, or a 2.5K (ish) OLED display. Since I use my laptop for programming and often use it in low light conditions such as a living room with dimmed lights in the evening, OLED just doesn't make sense. Knowing my luck I'd also run into OLED burn-in the moment the warranty expires. There are also some other issues with the X1 line in general, such as poor CPU cooling and the absolute nightmare that is opening them up to replace parts or clean them properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked at some other brands but it appears that in 2025 there's just aren't many good options for Linux users. I narrowed it down to two options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Buy a refurbished M1 or M2 Macbook and run Asahi Linux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Buy a Framework&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I eliminated the use of Asahi Linux because of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The battery life doesn't appear to be all that better than conventional laptops when running Linux. This isn't entirely surprising because of a lot of the battery improvements on macOS are the result of the software and hardware integration, not just the hardware&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There seem to be issues with suspend not working as well (at least based on various comments I came across), and hardware support in general is a bit dodgy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If something needs replacing I basically have an expensive paperweight, because everything is soldered together, assuming you could even find spare parts in the first place&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I'm not sure Asahi as a project will still be around in 5 years, but my laptop will be&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, Framework laptops has many supposed benefits: they're upgradable, repairable, actively work on Linux and even FreeBSD support (or at least sponsor developers working on this), allow you to customize the keyboard using QMK/VIAL. In fact, on paper it sounds like the perfect developer laptop. In reality, I'm not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Table of contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configuration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building the laptop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Operating system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Weight&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Design&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Display&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Power LED&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Battery&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WiFi and Bluetooth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keyboard&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trackpad&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Speakers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modular ports&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conclusion&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Framework has three models of laptops: a 12 inch, 13.5 inch and 16 inch laptop. My X1 Carbon is a 14 inch laptop but I've always felt like I wanted something just slightly larger. I ended up buying the Framework 16 for two reason:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I read various reports of the Framework 13 having issues with poor battery life, fan noise, heating, etc&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;While 16 inch is a fair bit larger than 14 inch, I was hoping it would be manageable size wise&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The base configuration is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Framework 16 DIY edition&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU: Ryzen AI 7 350&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAM: 2x8 GiB DDR5-5600&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SSD: WD Black SN7100, 500 GiB&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also bought an additional Intel AX210 WiFi card in case the default Mediatek card would cause any trouble, as I don't trust brands other than Intel when it comes to WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shipping took about a week or so, with the laptop making quite the journey from Taiwan to the Philippines to China, then to Japan and then back to China, then to Istanbul, then to France and at last to The Netherlands. I'm not sure what happened here, maybe the pilot got drunk or perhaps Fedex' tracking is just broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building the laptop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought the DIY edition which requires some manual assembly, though not nearly as much as I feared. All I had to do was install the SSD, RAM, and the keyboard spacers. The spacers, touchpad and keyboard use magnetic connectors so installing and removing them is trivial. To access the SSD and RAM slots you need to unscrew a plate that sits between these slots and the keyboard, but this only takes a few minutes using the provided screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't measure how long it took me to install it the first time, but opening it up and putting it back together a second time only took perhaps 5-10 minutes at most. For comparison, to replace most parts of the X1 Carbon you essentially have to take the whole thing apart and unscrew countless screws many of which are hard to find. Unsurprisingly, I've lost some of these screws over the years and dreaded opening it up the few times I had to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an area where Framework excels compared to all other brands: it's just so easy to swap the parts out that it puts other brands to shame when it comes to hardware maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Operating system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the operating system I initially gave FreeBSD 15 a quick try. I knew it wasn't going to be the final OS due to it still having issues with the Framework hardware (e.g. suspend doesn't work properly), but I figured it was worth a try just to see what would happen. The installation went fine and WiFi worked fine, though that was because I swapped the Mediatek card with the Intel AX210 as the Mediatek card doesn't work at all on FreeBSD. Upon loading the AMD drivers I encountered a kernel crash, likely due to the same issue as discussed in this drm-kmod issue. A laptop without working GPU drivers isn't going to work, so at this point I decided to give up on FreeBSD (again) and install Fedora 43 instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fedora 43 worked just fine as expected, and everything worked, so let's take a look at the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework 16 weights about 2.2 kg according to my kitchen scale. For comparison, my X1 Carbon weights 1.3 kg. That may not seem like a big difference, but the extra kilogram makes carrying around the Framework 16 more difficult. In particular, I don't feel comfortable carrying it with just one hand while this isn't a problem with the X1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework is best described as a bit of a chonker and I certainly don't see myself carrying it around a lot. This also gives it a bit of an identity crisis: laptops should be portable, otherwise why not just get a desktop. And yet the Framework 16 is neither portable nor remotely as powerful as a desktop, so who exactly is the target audience?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of the laptop is a bit polarizing. I like the combination of black and silver, but I hate how janky it all looks and feels due to the removable spacers. Note the lines separating the touchpad from the spacers on the left and right of it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only does it look weird, you can also feel the gap and edges when resting your palm on them. The silver spacers and touchpad are also raised slightly relative to the black keyboard area, and the edges are quite sharp. If you have arm hairs you may consider shaving them off or risk getting them stuck. I also suspect gunk will build up in these edges over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spacers aren't held solid in place either, meaning you can move them around and they have a bit of flex to them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may need to turn up your volume to hear the noise the spacers make. Also, apologies for the vertical video!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also a practical problem: due to the flex of the spacers if you try to hold the laptop on its sides it will actually "wobble" a bit. Combined with the weight I suspect that unless you hold on to this laptop for dear life, you will at some point drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These issues could be considered a minor issue in isolation but remember, this model costs two thousand Euros (I'll bring this up a few more times). For a premium price I expect a premium design and build quality, and this isn't it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The display isn't terrible, but it's not great either. Like most laptop displays that aren't Macbooks there's a bit of flex to the display, though this shouldn't be much of an issue. The colors of the display are overly saturated, with reds in particular looking more intense than they should. Here's a silly example of what a particular shade of red looks like on my X1 Carbon:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's the same color on the Framework 16:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that both displays were using the same brightness and the same color temperature/night light setting. For comparison, here's what those colors should look like when using a properly calibrated (at the hardware level at least) Eizo CS2740 that I use for my desktop:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm aware the quality of the photos isn't great, but if you compare the Framework version to the others you'll notice the colors are more saturated compared to what they should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The white/grey uniformity also leaves a lot to be desired, though this is true for all modern IPS displays that aren't manufactured by Eizo:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find non-uniform displays distracting as it can create a sort of tunnel vision effect/feeling. While the X1 Carbon also suffers from this problem, it feels less pronounced than in case of the Framework. Of course the Eizo display doesn't suffer from this problem at all (hence I bought it), but then it again it costs a ridiculous €1700.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the brightness. This display is bright, even at the lowest setting. I found various forum posts that mention the Framework 13 suffers from a similar issue but that you can at least now lower the brightness further on recent versions of Linux, but this isn't supported for the Framework 16. Here's what that looks like in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework 16 is on the left and the X1 Carbon on the right, both set to the lowest brightness setting that is still usable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework 16 being so much brighter means that using it in a darker room (e.g. a living room at night with the lights dimmed) makes you feel like a deer looking into the headlights of a car that's about to run you over. In other words, not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Power LED&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the topic of brightness, the power button in the top right corner of the keyboard has an LED that can't be turned off in the BIOS. Instead, you can set it to a few different settings including "Ultra low", but it doesn't make much of a difference as even at the lowest setting it's still too bright. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't sitting in the bottom right corner of your eye when you look at the display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up using this systemd service to turn the LED off upon booting, but something as simple as this should just be a BIOS option. Not being able to turn the LED off is apparently a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't do any GPU intensive testing such as video decoding. One annoying issue is that the display has a tendency to flicker. On top of that, there's a "nice" feature where the GPU reduces the display brightness based on the contents on the screen to conserve battery. The problem is that it takes a good two seconds or so to adjust, making it obvious and jarring to look at. It's especially noticeable when switching to the workspace overview in Gnome and back, due to a large section of this overview being a dark color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature is disabled by adding &lt;code&gt;amdgpu.abmlevel=0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX&lt;/code&gt;
in &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/grubg&lt;/code&gt;, followed by running &lt;code&gt;sudo grub2-mkconfig -o
/boot/grub2/grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; and a reboot. This also seems to reduce the amount of
flickering, though it still happened a few times after applying this setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some additional details on the ambient dimming anti-feature are in this forum post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can see the value of this feature but only if the GPU waits longer before adjusting the brightness and increases the transition time so it's less obvious. In it's current form it's just a nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU is fine, though I didn't extensively test its performance. It's certainly better than the mediocre Intel CPU of my X1 Carbon. One thing I noticed is that the CPU makes a sort of coil whine/crackling BZZZZZZ noise when under load. This isn't unique to Framework (e.g. my X1 also does this), the more open design (e.g. there's a big fan grill/mesh at the top of the keyboard) makes this more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't speak about the fan noise because I never heard them. This could either mean they are quiet enough or that I didn't stress the CPU enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Battery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't do any proper testing of battery usage, but it seems to be on par with other Linux capable laptops based on my usage thus far. This means you'll likely be looking at 6-8 hours of battery per charge for average programming usage. It seems this is the case for basically any reasonable Linux-capable laptop these days, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did notice that it drains quite a bit when suspended: when I put it to sleep the first night the battery was at 47%. When I opened the laptop again some 8 hours later the battery was at 42%. This means you're looking at about 5% of battery per average night, which isn't great. Hibernate could be an alternative but support for it on Fedora is a bit dodgy and requires some manual work I'm not interested in, so I didn't test this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;WiFi and Bluetooth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the Intel and Mediatek cards work without issue. Both achieve the same speeds on my 1 Gbps connection over a 5Ghz network (with a channel width of 80mhz): about 800-900 Mbps for uploads and somewhere between 600 and 700 Mbps for downloads. While not being able to achieve the full 1 Gbps speed over WiFi is expected, I was a bit surprised to see that uploads are in fact faster than downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tested various other devices with similar WiFi hardware and they all upload and download at about the same speeds, and all operate at slightly lower speeds (500-600 Mbps, depending on your luck).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think it's the network itself either: the access points are TP-Link EAP660 HDs that can handle speeds well beyond 1 Gbps. As far as I know the configuration is also sound (including the use of specific channels to reduce interference to a minimum).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, 600-700 Mbps over WiFi is more than I'll probably ever need so I didn't dive into this further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't specifically test Bluetooth but it did detect a few devices, so I'll assume this will work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Keyboard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some reviews I read mentioned that the keyboard has a bit of flex to it, but I didn't notice this. The keycaps are a little mushy, which isn't too bad but not great either. The difference in key size and spacing compared to the X1 did mean I pressed the wrong key at times, but I suspect this is just a matter of adjusting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The keyboard runs QMK, albeit a rather outdated version of QMK released in 2022. I experimented with porting the code to a newer version so I could take advantage of some features that I use in my split keyboard, but couldn't get it to work. The official way to configure the keyboard is by using this VIAL web application. This application requires WebHID support which isn't implemented by Firefox, requiring me to install and use Chromium just to configure the keyboard. This isn't enough though, as on Linux you'll need to install some additional udev rules to get things working. The official rules provided by QMK didn't work, instead I used the rules from this forum reply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once set up I was able to configure the keyboard such as by changing the layout from QWERTY to Colemak-DH. VIAL is pretty basic though and the interface is rather clunky, so I'm not a fan of this approach. I hope that at some point Framework will upstream their keyboard logic into the official QMK repository to make this process easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Trackpad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trackpad is decent, though I noticed it's overly sensitive when it comes to scrolling. For example, on various occasions I lifted my fingers off the trackpad without any swiping motion and somehow still managed to trigger a scrolling motion. The trackpad of the X1 Carbon doesn't have this problem and subsequently is easier and more pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Speakers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They're terribly. Or more precisely, they're terrible when the volume is less than 50% or so. What appears to be happening is that adjusting the volume below 50% doesn't result in it being louder but instead changes how it sounds (for a lack of a better description). At lower volumes it sounds like sound playing over a phone in speaker mode, with a sort of tin can/metallic sound to it. Once you hit 50% or so it starts to sound more like an OK set of speakers but it also becomes noticeable louder. There's a setting in the BIOS that you can set to "Linux" mode to supposedly improve the quality but it was already set to this value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While most laptop speakers aren't great (even the Dolby Atmos speakers of the X1 Carbon are mediocre), for a laptop that costs two thousand Euros the sound is disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modular ports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interesting feature of the Framework is that you can swap out the various ports. You want 6 USB-C ports? You can do that! What about 3 headphone jacks? Also possible! Replacing them is quite easy, though for some reason my headphone jack adapter required some additional force to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the keyboard area the design is a bit janky though, with visible lines/space between the adapters and the case, though this at least is something you won't notice unless you're explicitly looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the conclusion: is it worth buying this laptop, considering most configurations will cost you around two thousand Euros? To be honest, no, not at all. For a premium price I expect a premium laptop, but the Framework 16 feels more like a €1200-€1500 laptop at best and certainly doesn't deliver a premium experience. I understand Framework is a young company still trying to figure out a lot of things, but two thousand Euros for this kind of laptop is just absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason I've submitted a request to return the laptop. What I'll be replacing my X1 Carbon with instead I'm not entirely sure of. One option is the Framework 13 given that it solves at least some issues I have with the Framework 16 (e.g. it's bulkiness and inability to lower the brightness further), but it also seems to share many of the other issues such as poor speaker quality and (at least from hat I could find) worse heat regulation, and a (possibly) worse battery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've looked at various other brands such as System76 and the many other Clevo resellers, but they all seem to suffer similar issues such as poor battery life, poor performance, difficult to maintain hardware wise, or some combination thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess for now the X1 Carbon will have to hold out a little longer, provided I don't throw it out of the window the next time I can't get the various dodgy keyboard keys to work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written by me, proof-read by an LLM. &lt;lb/&gt;Details at end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every now and then a compiler will surprise me with a really smart trick. When I first saw this optimisation I could hardly believe it. I was looking at loop optimisation, and wrote something like this simple function that sums all the numbers up to a given value:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far so decent: GCC has done some preliminary checks, then fallen into a loop that efficiently sums numbers using &lt;code&gt;lea&lt;/code&gt; (we’ve seen this before). But taking a closer look at the loop we see something unusual:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.L3:
  lea edx, [rdx+1+rax*2]        ; result = result + 1 + x*2
  add eax, 2                    ; x += 2
  cmp edi, eax                  ; x != value
  jne .L3                       ; keep looping
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler has cleverly realised it can do two numbers1 at a time using the fact it can see we’re going to add &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt;, which is the same as adding &lt;code&gt;x*2 + 1&lt;/code&gt;. Very cunning, I think you’ll agree!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you turn the optimiser up to &lt;code&gt;-O3&lt;/code&gt; you’ll see the compiler works even harder to vectorise the loop using parallel adds. All very clever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all for GCC. Let’s see what clang does with our code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where I nearly fell off my chair: there is no loop! Clang checks for positive &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;, and if so it does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  lea eax, [rdi - 1]        ; eax = value - 1
  lea ecx, [rdi - 2]        ; ecx = value - 2
  imul rcx, rax             ; rcx = (value - 1) * (value - 2)
  shr rcx                   ; rcx &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= 1
  lea eax, [rdi + rcx]      ; eax = value + rcx
  dec eax                   ; --eax
  ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was not at all obvious to me what on earth was going on here. By backing out the maths a little, this is equivalent to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;v + ((v - 1)(v - 2) / 2) - 1;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding the parentheses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;v + (vÂ² - 2v - v + 2) / 2 - 1
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rearranging a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(vÂ² - 3v + 2) / 2 + (v - 1)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiplying the &lt;code&gt;(v - 1)&lt;/code&gt; by 2 / 2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(vÂ² - 3v + 2) / 2 + (2v - 2)/2
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combining those and cancelling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(vÂ² - v) / 2
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplifying and factoring gives us &lt;code&gt;v(v - 1) / 2&lt;/code&gt; which is the closed-form solution to the “sum of integers”! Truly amazing2 - we’ve gone from an O(n) algorithm as written, to an O(1) one!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love that despite working with compilers for more than twenty years, they can still surprise and delight me. The years of experience and work that have been poured into making compilers great is truly humbling, and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re nearly at the end of this series - there’s so much more to say but that will have to wait for another time. Tomorrow will be a little different: see you then!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some of the initial code checks for odd/even and accounts accordingly. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does the compiler emit this exact sequence and not a slightly more straightforward sequence? I think it’s partly avoiding overflow in cases where it might otherwise overflow and just a side effect of the way clang tracks and infers induction variables. I really don’t know for sure, though. ↩&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Original Paper&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: Unrelenting pressure and an “always-on” culture can leave no time for genuine rest among young adults. While playing video games has been noted to afford cognitive escapism and relaxation, critical questions remain about the influence of popular video games, such as Super Mario Bros., and their potential effects on young adults’ burnout risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study examined the extent to which, if at all, popular video games such as Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi could foster childlike wonder. It also investigated the potential of these games to reduce burnout risk among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We used a mixed methods approach. First, qualitative data were collected through 41 exploratory, in-depth interviews (women: n=19, 46.3%; men: n=21, 51.2%; prefer not to disclose sex: n=1, 2.4%; mean age 22.51, SD 1.52 years) with university students who had experience playing Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi. Second, quantitative data were collected in a cross-sectional survey (N=336) of players of Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi to examine the games’ affordance of childlike wonder, overall happiness in life, and burnout risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Insights from in-depth interviews showed that players appreciated the ability of Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games to instill childlike wonder, enhance happiness in life, and reduce burnout risk. Quantitative analyses showed that the games’ affordance of childlike wonder positively affected young adults’ happiness (b=0.30, SE=0.04, t=6.80, 95% CI 0.21-0.38; P&amp;lt;.001). In turn, overall happiness significantly reduced the risk of burnout (b=–0.48, SE=0.05, t=–9.55, 95% CI –0.572 to –0.377). Results showed that happiness fully mediated the impact of childlike wonder on burnout, as the direct effect of childlike wonder on burnout risk became insignificant (b=–0.08, SE=0.04, t=–1.88, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.01; P=.06), while the indirect effect of childlike wonder on burnout risk was significant (b=–0.14, bootstrapped SE=0.03, 95% CI –0.20 to –0.09).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The findings showed the significant positive effect of popular video games such as Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi on fostering players’ childlike wonder, increasing happiness, and reducing burnout risk. This study was among the first to identify childlike wonder as an emotional pathway through which mainstream video games could enhance well-being and reduce burnout. By moving beyond escapism and nostalgia, it offers a new perspective on how well-designed, globally familiar games can function as accessible, resilience-building digital microenvironments. These findings contributed to research bridging gaming and mental health and have practical implications for game designers, educators, and health professionals interested in promoting mental wellness through everyday play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;doi:10.2196/84219&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Keywords&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Overview of Young Adults and Burnout Risk&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people today face a unique constellation of interconnected pressures that contribute significantly to anxiety, worry, and burnout [&lt;/p&gt;- ]. Soaring costs for housing, education (leading to significant student loan debt), and basic necessities create significant financial pressure [ , ]. Achieving traditional markers of adulthood (home ownership and a stable career) feels increasingly out of reach for numerous young people. Witnessing vast wealth disparities and feeling the system is rigged can fuel pessimism and a sense of unfairness about future prospects [ ]. Furthermore, intense pressure to excel academically from a young age, secure prestigious internships or jobs, and build a seemingly perfect resume can create chronic stress [ ]. Success is often narrowly defined and hypercompetitive. Importantly, these cumulative stressors arise during what developmental psychologists describe as emerging adulthood, a period marked by identity exploration and instability [ ].&lt;p&gt;Young adulthood, often referred to as emerging adulthood, is considered a distinct stage of development characterized by identity exploration, instability, self-focus, and shifts in social roles, typically spanning the late teens and 20s [&lt;/p&gt;]. Epidemiological research indicates that many mental disorders first appear during this life stage, although timing varies across diagnostic categories—for example, anxiety disorders tend to surface earlier, while mood disorders can appear later [ , ]. These onset patterns often coincide with major life transitions involving education, work, and growing autonomy, which have been linked to higher psychological distress and lower well-being among young adults [ ]. Hence, focusing on this demographic remains critical for understanding today’s mental health challenges and for identifying where digital interventions might best support well-being.&lt;p&gt;In addition, the current “always-on” digital culture and social media expose young people to curated highlights of others’ lives, careers, and achievements 24/7, fostering unrealistic comparisons, fear of missing out, and feelings of inadequacy [&lt;/p&gt;- ]. The digital world also provides new avenues for bullying and harassment, impacting mental health significantly. Moreover, smartphones make it difficult to disconnect from work, studies, or social obligations [ , ]. The expectation to be constantly available and responsive erodes downtime and contributes to burnout. Moreover, doomscrolling or the constant exposure to negative news cycles and global crises (climate change, political or social conflict and unrest, or pandemics) can be overwhelming and induce feelings of helplessness [ - ]. Fueled by social media and competitive environments, many young adults internalize unrealistic expectations of perfection in all areas (looks, career, relationships, and hobbies), leading to self-criticism and anxiety about failure [ - ].&lt;p&gt;Moreover, while digitally connected, many young adults report feeling lonelier than ever [&lt;/p&gt;, , ]. Traditional community structures (extended family, local community groups, and religious institutions) often play a less central role nowadays. Despite online networks, forming and maintaining deep, meaningful in-person relationships can be challenging in what is often perceived as a fast-paced, transient world [ ]. Taken together, these factors can create a state of chronic, unrelenting stress [ , - ]. Feeling powerless over economic realities, global issues, or demanding work or school environments fuels burnout. Constant pressure and the “always-on” culture leave little time for genuine rest, relaxation, and hobbies that replenish energy. Hence, these factors do not exist in isolation. They feed into each other.&lt;p&gt;Social media comparisons fuel anxiety and worry about the future sap motivation, while perceived loneliness makes coping harder. It creates a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. This study aims to make a step toward addressing the mental health crisis facing many young adults today. More specifically, video games, such as open-world games, have been shown in prior work to afford cognitive escapism, relaxation, and enhanced well-being to young people [&lt;/p&gt;]. Video games and gamification techniques have been noted to positively affect the well-being of players in different ways [ - ]. However, critical questions remain about the potential role popular video games can play in young adults’ lives.&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Background on Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi Games&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Super Mario Bros. franchise created by Nintendo Co, Ltd stands as one of the most globally popular and recognizable in entertainment history [&lt;/p&gt;, ]. Since the groundbreaking original in 1985, Mario games have sold more than 430 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video game series ever. Its appeal transcends age, culture, and nationality. Super Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and the cute dinosaur Yoshi are all cultural icons, instantly recognizable even to nongamers. Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games can help act as stress buffers and reduce negative affect in several critical ways. For example, engaging with the demanding spatial navigation, timing, and problem-solving tasks in Super Mario Bros. requires focused attention (working memory load). This acts as a distractor, effectively diverting finite cognitive resources away from rumination on real-world worries or negative thoughts, thereby interrupting cycles of pessimism or anxiety. Players become deeply immersed in “being” Mario or Yoshi, navigating the space, temporarily suspending self-referential thoughts and worries about real-life identity or performance.&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the core narrative of Mario and Yoshi persistently overcoming obstacles to achieve goals serves as a powerful symbolic representation of perseverance and eventual triumph. Engaging with this narrative, especially through active participation (the player is Mario or Yoshi), can subtly reinforce schemas related to resilience and positive outcomes. The core objective (“Help Prince Florian” or “Rescue Princess Peach”) is unambiguous and morally positive, offering a clear purpose without complex emotional baggage or ambiguity. This reduces cognitive load associated with real-world problem interpretation. While challenging in their own ways, Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games generally lack the prolonged high-stress tension of survival horror or competitive multiplayer games. Their rhythm often involves bursts of focused action followed by brief moments of lower tension (eg, traversing cleared sections), allowing for a more sustainable and restorative form of play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games can be a potent tool for temporary stress reduction, mood enhancement, and cognitive restoration, creating a mental “reset” that can foster a more optimistic and resourceful return to daily life. Their specific game design, combining skill demands with low real-world stakes, predictable rules, and positive affect induction, can make these games an effective vehicle for enhanced mental well-being. Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games, hence, can act as an antidote by creating a virtual space that is the psychological inverse of a burnout-inducing environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Enhancing Childlike Wonder and Reducing Burnout Risk&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi video games can offer pure, unadulterated joy and playfulness. More specifically, Super Mario Bros. games may help rekindle childlike wonder and help players see magic in the everyday. Jumping, running, breaking blocks, and collecting coins; these actions are inherently joyful and tactile. The satisfying “boing” of a jump, the “ching” of a coin, the smash of a brick; all these can trigger simple, primal pleasure. Mushrooms make players big, flowers shoot fire, stars make players invincible, turtles are cute enemies, clouds and trees have eyes! It presents a world operating on its own delightful, nonsensical logic, bypassing adult cynicism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the vibrant colors, upbeat music, and generally sunny atmosphere (even underground or in castles has a playful menace) create an optimistic baseline. It is hard to stay cynical when that iconic tune is playing. In essence, Super Mario Bros. games act like a playful lens. It reminds players of the joy of pure discovery, the thrill of simple challenges, the magic of transformation, and the power of imagination that they possessed as children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the visual and auditory design of Yoshi games is meticulously crafted to feel safe, warm, and inviting. Games such as Yoshi’s Crafted World and Yoshi’s Woolly World use a tangible, diorama-like aesthetic. Everything appears to be made of yarn, cardboard, and craft supplies. This evokes a sense of handmade charm and nostalgia, reminiscent of childhood arts and crafts. The world feels nonthreatening and playful. Yoshi games are bursting with joyful, bright colors, while the music is famously cheerful and melodic. Yoshi’s vocalizations (the flutter jump and the egg spit) and the sounds of collectibles are satisfying and cute. This creates a consistent visual and audio landscape of positivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnout is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism (detachment or negativity), and reduced efficacy. Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi video gameplay can help reduce burnout risk in the following ways. First, the attentional demand of Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi gameplay provides a mental break from work or role-related rumination (a core driver of exhaustion). This allows depleted cognitive resources (eg, prefrontal cortex function taxed by decision fatigue) to replenish. Induced flow states and positive affect (dopamine or serotonin release) counter chronic stress responses (eg, lowered cortisol and reduced sympathetic nervous system activation). This provides physiological recovery crucial for combating exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ rewarding mechanics and light-hearted aesthetic actively elevate mood, counteracting the persistent negative affect associated with burnout. That is, the game’s core loop reinforces the belief that effort leads to reward. Collecting coins, finding secrets, or beating a level after multiple tries demonstrates a reliable, predictable link between action and positive outcome, rebuilding trust in effort that burnout erodes. Moreover, the games’ narrative (perseverance leading to success) and aesthetics (colorful and playful) provide exposure to positive, noncynical representations, subtly challenging pervasive negative worldviews fostered by burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Yoshi games are also famously accessible. This removes the stress of failure and allows players to simply enjoy being in the world. The challenge comes from discovery and 100% completion, not from mere survival, making it a choice rather than a demand. While burnout is often fueled by anxiety about the future or rumination on the past, Yoshi games anchor players in the now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games provide psychological restoration. The warm aesthetics, cheerful music, and a lack of intense pressure are not draining. They are replenishing. Playing feels like a break for the brain, similar to the effect of a walk in a pleasant park. The charm and kindness inherent in these games make it hard to be cynical. The games offer joyful sounds and enchanting visual feedback that help rebuild a sense of competence and agency in a low-pressure environment, countering the helplessness that fuels burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, in this study we aim to investigate if popular video games such as Nintendo’s classic Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi franchise are able to promote players’ childlike wonder—a state of openness, curiosity, and delight in the face of the new or mundane—and whether such experiences enhance overall happiness in life and reduce the risk of burnout among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Methods&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Study 1&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Research Design Overview&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of our qualitative study were reported in accordance with the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines [&lt;/p&gt;]. In addition, we adhered to the Journal Article Reporting Standards-mixed methods article reporting standards and offered information recommended for inclusion in research that reports the collection and integration of qualitative and quantitative data [ ]. We conducted semistructured, cross-sectional interviews with open-ended, predetermined questions to explore and consider different personal opinions and views and help generate novel insights from data gathered in a natural setting [ , ]. Specifically, we invited study participants to share their thoughts about Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games, and how, if at all, such a video game affects their day-to-day life. That is, during the interview, study participants were given an opportunity to reflect on and discuss how Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games made them feel, what benefits (if any) they got from playing the game, and how and why they played the game. In case study participants played more than one Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi game, they were invited to reflect on the game they played the most.&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Researcher Description&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help minimize any potential bias, 4 trained research assistants (RAs) conducted the interviews. RAs were trained and instructed not to guide the interviewees and their responses in any way. The team of RAs was diverse in sex (2 women and 2 men) and ethnicity (from 3 different continents) to help ensure increased comfort with study participants during interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Study Participants or Data Sources&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Participant Recruitment&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our qualitative study, we used a convenience sampling method. Potential participants were recruited via posters and by handing out flyers to students on a university campus in July and August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Participant Selection&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specific eligibility criteria for taking part in the qualitative study were that participants were full-time students and that they had some personal experience playing a Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi game before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Data Collection&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 3 weeks, exploratory, in-depth interviews were conducted with 41 participants (women: n=19, 46.3%; men: n=21, 51.2%; preferred not to disclose sex: n=1, 2.4%; mean age 22.51, SD 1.52 years). All interviewees were full-time students (confirmed by their student IDs) and had experience playing a Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi game (screening questions by the RAs included the name of the specific Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi games respondents had played and which console they used to play the game, eg, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, or Nintendo Switch 2). Interviews were conducted in a university cafeteria and lasted between 25 and 40 minutes. All interviewees were reassured of the anonymity of their responses and were informed that their participation would help inform academic research. At the end of the interview, each interviewee was given a chance to ask any questions they may have had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Statistical Analysis&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined our qualitative data gathered from the interviews, following recommended and established procedures for qualitative data analyses [&lt;/p&gt;- ]. RAs had a chance to familiarize themselves with the data collected by transcribing the interviews and carefully reading the transcripts. Furthermore, the coding of interview data was conducted in duplicate by the authors, and any potential discrepancy was discussed and resolved. In doing so, we followed the constant comparison technique in prior published work, collected and analyzed interview data in tandem, and continuously compared the newly collected data against the existing insights. As a first step of our analysis, we grouped conceptually linked data and reduced them to a set of meaningful concepts. That is, we examined and analyzed the data to develop insights and a holistic understanding of interviewees’ responses and key elements of Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi games that were noted to affect their lives.&lt;p&gt;In addition, we used descriptive phrases and open coding to develop further insights regarding key drivers and potential process explanations about interviewees’ reflections of Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi games and critical elements of gameplay that may influence their overall happiness in life and burnout risk. Moreover, in joint discussions by the team of RAs and authors, we integrated relevant literature in an iterative process, further explored key elements of Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi games that influenced players’ lives, and finalized the key elements of our conceptual framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Study 2&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Research Design&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of study 2, we conducted a cross-sectional survey using a convenience sampling approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Inclusion and Exclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were deemed eligible to take part in the study if they were full-time university students at the time of completing the study and if they had personal experience playing a Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi game. We conducted the study in July and August 2025 and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines to report the observational, cross-sectional studies (&lt;/p&gt;) [ ].&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Sampling Procedures&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential study participants were recruited by handing out flyers and using posters on a university campus in July and August 2025. Trained RAs informed potential study participants that the study would take no longer than 15 minutes and that each participant would receive US $5 (approximately £4) as compensation for taking part in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Sample Size, Power, and Precision&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 5 weeks, 4 RAs helped with the data collection (student ID check and simple screening questions before the study, ie, which Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi game participants had played before and which console they had used for gameplay, such as Wii U, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, etc) and managed to recruit a total of 350 participants. Because 14 participants did not complete the entire survey, their responses were discarded from the study, and the effective number of responses was 336. In case study participants noted playing more than one Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi game, they were encouraged to consider and think of the game they played the most when answering the study’s survey questions. RAs invited participants to complete a brief paper-and-pencil questionnaire about gaming and their daily life activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Participant Characteristics&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final sample consisted of 336 full-time university students (women: 19/41, 46.3%; men: 21/41, 51.2%; prefer not to disclose sex: 1/41, 2.4%; mean age 22.51, SD 1.52).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Measures and Covariates&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, participants answered questions about burnout risk that were adapted from validated, previously published scales designed to measure burnout risk [&lt;/p&gt;, ], and included items such as “I feel emotionally drained by my daily responsibilities (caregiving, work, etc),” “I have become more cynical or detached about activities I used to care about,” and “I doubt whether my efforts actually make a difference”).&lt;p&gt;In addition, participants were invited to answer questions to measure their overall happiness in life. Measurement items to capture life happiness were adapted from previously published happiness in life scales [&lt;/p&gt;, ] and consisted of 3 items (“I feel grateful for the good things in my life,” “I am satisfied with the overall direction of my life and look forward to what lies ahead,” “Overall I would describe myself as a happy person”). Moreover, we captured the extent to which gameplay enhanced participants’ childlike wonder by adapting three items from previously published scale items on noticing novelty and joy in discovery, feeling wonder in response to stimuli [ - ] (“Playing a Super Mario Bros./Yoshi game helps me feel delighted by small, ordinary things that others overlook (e.g., shapes in clouds, patterns in pavement),” “Super Mario Bros./Yoshi gameplay encourages me stop to admire or explore things that spark my curiosity, even if they seem unimportant (e.g., a hidden path, an unusual insect),” “Playing a Super Mario Bros./Yoshi game encourages me to pause and to appreciate playful or whimsical details in my environment”). All responses were measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree). As control, participants indicated their sex (1=female, 2=male, 3=prefer not to disclose).&lt;p&gt;To ensure the quality of measurement, all scale items were reviewed by the research team for clarity and consistency before survey administration. The questionnaire was distributed in printed form on campus and completed individually by respondents. RAs who facilitated recruitment and survey distribution were not informed of the study’s hypotheses and followed standardized instructions to minimize expectancy or response bias. Psychometric properties of the measures were examined using confirmatory factor analyses and reliability testing. All factor loadings were significant (P&amp;lt;.001). Cronbach α, composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE) all exceeded widely accepted thresholds (α ≥.70, CR ≥0.70, and AVE ≥0.50), indicating strong internal consistency and convergent validity [&lt;/p&gt;- ]. The Fornell-Larcker criterion further supported discriminant validity across constructs [ ].&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Statistical Analysis&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We followed recommended procedures for conducting confirmatory factor analyses and examined the factor structure and reliability scores for the measurement items in our survey study [&lt;/p&gt;, ]. This was done to examine whether the items significantly loaded on their intended factors and had weak cross-loadings. Furthermore, we examined the AVE and CR scores for the scales used in our study. Moreover, we tested whether the average variance extracted for each construct was greater than the squared correlations between the construct and other variables in our survey [ ]. The hypothesized 3-factor model (childlike wonder, happiness, and burnout risk) was tested using confirmatory factor analysis in IBM SPSS AMOS 29.0 with maximum likelihood estimation.&lt;p&gt;In addition, we conducted a mediation analysis with the PROCESS macro [&lt;/p&gt;] (model 4; bootstrapped samples=5000; 95% CI) to examine the influence of Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder (independent variable) on overall happiness in life (mediator) and, consequently, on players’ burnout risk (dependent variable). In order for PROCESS not to treat sex as a continuous variable, sex was coded as a dummy variable (0=female, 1=male). Due to the insufficient sample size (n=1), the “prefer not to disclose” category was excluded from analysis.&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Ethical Considerations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Study 1&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethics approval for the study was received from Imperial College London’s Analytics, Marketing, and Operations (AMO) Department.

In&lt;/p&gt;, we list the representative quotes, which indicate the extent to which players viewed Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games as fostering childlike wonder and the influence they had on their day-to-day life. In addition, interviewees noted how Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi gameplay affected their overall happiness in life as well as how gameplay helped reduce their risk of burnout (refer to for representative quotes).&lt;p&gt;Participants frequently described the bright colors and optimistic tone of Super Mario Bros. Wonder as evoking feelings of calm and childlike joy.&lt;/p&gt;illustrates this visual atmosphere, depicting the cheerful landscape that several interviewees referred to when recalling moments of wonder and relaxation.&lt;p&gt;Interviewees highlighted how the game’s design balances challenge with playfulness, creating a sense of ease that contrasts with daily pressures.&lt;/p&gt;exemplifies this tone, showing even “enemies” portrayed in a gentle, nonthreatening way—an aspect the interviewees associated with relaxation and stress relief.&lt;p&gt;Interviewees often described Yoshi’s Crafted World as a warm, inviting environment that felt comforting and safe.&lt;/p&gt;illustrates the handcrafted, diorama-like aesthetic that many associated with nostalgia and emotional restoration.&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Game key effects&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Representative quotes&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Childlike wonder&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Overall happiness in life&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Burnout risk reduction&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Study 2: Statistical Analysis Results&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed survey measurement items and reliability scores are listed in&lt;/p&gt;. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that all measurement items significantly loaded on their intended factors (&amp;gt;0.79; P&amp;lt;.001) with weak cross-loadings (&amp;lt;0.27). In addition, AVE and CR scores exceeded the recommended thresholds. In addition, the Cronbach α scores were generally high and results showed that the AVE for each construct was greater than the squared correlations between the construct and other variables in our survey in support of discriminant validity ( ). The model demonstrated good fit to the data (χ224=30.6, Tucker-Lewis index=0.99, comparative fit index=0.99, normed fit index=0.98, and root mean square error of approximation=0.03; 90% CI 0.00-0.06; P=.17).

In turn, overall happiness in life significantly reduced players’ burnout risk (b=–0.48, SE=0.05, t=–9.55, 95% CI –0.57 to –0.38; ). Gender had no significant effect on happiness (b=–0.05, SE=0.12, t=–0.42, 95% CI –0.29 to 0.19; P=.68; ) and no significant effect on burnout (b=0.02, SE=0.11, t=0.14, 95% CI –0.20 to 0.23; P=.89; ). Furthermore, the results showed that happiness fully mediated the impact of childlike wonder on burnout, as the direct effect of childlike wonder on burnout risk became insignificant (b=–0.08, SE=0.04, t=–1.88, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.01; ), while the indirect effect of childlike wonder on burnout risk was significant (b=–0.14, BootSE=0.03, 95% CI –0.20 to –0.09).&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Predictor&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;b (95% CI)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;SE&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;t test&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;P value&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;DVa: Happinessb&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Constant&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2.50 (2.07 to 2.93)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0.22&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;11.43&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt;.001&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Childlike wonder&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0.30 (0.21 to 0.38)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0.04&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;6.79&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt;.001&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Gender&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;–0.05 (–0.29 to 0.19)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0.12&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;–0.42&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;.68&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;aDV: dependent variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bR=0.35, R²=0.12, mean squared error=1.43, F2, 333=23.16; P&amp;lt;.001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Predictor&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;b (95% CI)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;SE&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;t test&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;P value&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;DVa: Burnoutb&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Constant&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5.37 (4.91-5.83)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0.23&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;22.99&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt;.001&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Childlike wonder&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;–0.08 (–0.16 to 0.00)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0.04&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;–1.88&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;.06&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Happiness&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;–0.48 (–0.57 to –0.38)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0.05&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;–9.56&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt;.001&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Gender&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0.02 (–0.20 to 0.23)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0.11&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0.14&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;.89&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;aDV: dependent variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bR=0.52, R²=0.27, mean squared error=1.17, F3, 332=40.80; P&amp;lt;.001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Principal Findings&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study show that players appreciated Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder as well as enhanced feelings of happiness. In addition, the findings of the study indicated the extent to which players noted Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ ability to reduce burnout risks. The findings of the quantitative study further showed that Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder was positively associated with people’s overall happiness in life. Finally, happiness was negatively associated with burnout risk of study respondents, hence indicating the potential for popular video games such as Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games to help reduce burnout risk. The colorful, low-pressure worlds of Yoshi games were described by interviewees as a “vacation for the mind.”&lt;/p&gt;illustrates this atmosphere, conveying the playful and uplifting tone that helps transform ordinary play into a restorative emotional experience.&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Comparison to Prior Work&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior work has noted the role video games can play in people’s lives, including enhanced cognitive escapism and relaxation [&lt;/p&gt;- ]. Beyond escapism, prior research using Self-Determination Theory indicates that games can support basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which are associated with intrinsic motivation and need-contingent, short-term improvements in well-being [ ]. Players have also been noted to engage with games strategically for mood management and coping-based emotion regulation, selecting particular gameplay challenges or mechanics to reduce stress, elevate mood, or regain a sense of control [ - ]. How popular video games such as Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi may affect young adults’ ability to look at the world and their lives in renewed, childlike wonder and how this may affect their overall happiness and reduce risk of burnout, however, remains unanswered. Moreover, nostalgia has been noted to promote well-being by drawing on cherished past experiences to restore positive affect, meaning, and a sense of connection [ ], and mainstream, long-running franchises often cue players’ nostalgia, especially when they prompt recall of past play experience with familiar series, settings, or characters [ ]. However, nostalgia alone may not fully explain the uplifting, playful stance reported by players of whimsical franchises such as Super Mario and Yoshi, pointing to a distinct experiential state-childlike wonder-that has not yet been systematically examined.&lt;p&gt;While prior research examined how various gamification techniques may enhance people’s feelings of hope or connection with a new digital offering [&lt;/p&gt;- ], critical questions remained about the role highly popular video games, such as Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi, may play in reducing people’s burnout risk. Although previous studies shed light on designing offerings that make people’s lives easier, put a smile on their face, and possibly inspire them and help form a stronger bond with them [ - ], work has only recently begun to examine how specific content and structural features of games shape emotional outcomes. For example, game aesthetics such as visual style, world design, music, and pacing have been proposed to elicit both hedonic enjoyment and deeper, reflective emotions [ , ]. Likewise, soundtrack music in games has been shown to shape players’ emotional responses, for example, by intensifying positive emotions and enhancing horror experiences [ ]. In addition, in-game success has been found to predict mood repair and satisfaction of competence and autonomy to mediate effects on enjoyment [ ]. Notably, these mechanisms have seldom been linked to broader indicators of well-being, such as sustained happiness or resilience to burnout, particularly among young adults.&lt;p&gt;Recent reviews suggest that commercial video games show promise for alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression [&lt;/p&gt;, ]. While these findings are encouraging, the present study takes a different perspective: rather than positioning entertainment games as treatments, it considers whether everyday play can function as a subtle, restorative micro-environment. Thus, the current study contributes to work examining the influence of gaming on mental well-being and, in doing so, further helps bridge gaming and mental health science [ , ] by identifying childlike wonder as a unique emotional pathway through which mainstream games may support happiness and reduce burnout risk.&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of video gameplay, including Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi, are likely to be contingent on moderate, voluntary play primarily for enjoyment. Compulsive video gameplay or excessive escapism used solely to avoid real problems can be maladaptive and undermine optimism by neglecting real-world agency. Moreover, playing Super Mario and Yoshi games can help mitigate individual experiences of burnout, but does not address systemic causes (eg, excessive workload, unfair practices). Thus, it may complement, not replace, organizational interventions. Moreover, in this study, we examined self-reported burnout risk. Future research examining the long-term effects of gameplay on actual burnout risk is richly deserving. In addition, we encourage future work to study the potential effects of gameplay on people of varying ages, demographic backgrounds, etc., and examine the influence that such gameplay may have on various aspects of people’s overall well-being. Examining such variations could reveal how developmental context and lived experience shape how popular games relate to well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Future Research&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specific design elements of Super Mario Bros., as well as Yoshi games and their focus on skill-based mastery, low violence, predictable rules, achievable goals, and positive aesthetics, may be crucial for fostering the beneficial aspects described in this study. Not all video games offer this combination. Future research that further investigates the potential positive and negative effects of video gameplay on human happiness, resilience, and empathy is richly deserving. Current work examines the extent to which internet use may affect people’s anxiety and stress [&lt;/p&gt;, ]; however, there is also work suggesting offerings to put a smile on users’ faces and make their lives easier [ - ].&lt;p&gt;Because additional interviews continued to offer new and nuanced insights, saturation in our qualitative study may not have been achieved, and we invite future research to explore and further investigate the role of popular games in people’s lives and their potential impact on the resilience, coping ability, physical and emotional health, as well as overall well-being of people across ages and various lifestyles. As previous research indicates an increasing number of people searching for meaning in their lives and feeling detached from nature as well as fellow human beings [&lt;/p&gt;- ], additional work studying the effects of popular video games on people’s empathy, perceived loneliness, biophilia, as well as gratitude and levels of overconsumption is richly deserving.&lt;p&gt;Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros., as well as Yoshi games, can be more than just platformers. They are carefully constructed wonder simulators. They reject the high-stakes, high-stress models of many modern games in favor of an experience that prioritizes safety, curiosity, and joy. For a person whose life may be dominated by deadlines, overwhelming demands, and a perceived loss of control, stepping into Super Mario’s or Yoshi’s crafted world can be a form of digital therapy. It allows the person to practice being curious again, to experience uncomplicated joy, to succeed in small, measurable ways, and to simply exist in a moment of bright, colorful, and kind-hearted joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These games, in essence, are a vacation for the mind, facilitating the very childlike wonder that burnout so effectively extinguishes. Intentional game design can do more than just entertain - it can heal, restore, and inspire. Future research further exploring the various ways gameplay may affect people’s outlook and approach to life is richly deserving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights from the qualitative study indicated players’ appreciation of Super Mario and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder, happiness in life, and a reduction in burnout risk. In addition to this, the findings of the quantitative analyses showed how Super Mario and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder influenced happiness in life and significantly reduced burnout risk. These video games, hence, can be effective vehicles for enhanced mental well-being. More specifically, the current findings show that Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games act as an effective antidote by creating a virtual space that is the psychological inverse of a burnout-inducing environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the findings for this study demonstrate that popular video games, such as Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi, can enhance childlike wonder, which in turn increases overall happiness and reduces burnout risk. This work is innovative in identifying childlike wonder as a previously underexplored emotional mechanism that links everyday gameplay with improved well-being. It differs from prior studies that have focused mainly on escapism, stress relief, or need satisfaction by showing how mainstream entertainment games can evoke curiosity, playfulness, and joy that counteract cynicism and exhaustion. The study contributes to the growing field connecting gaming and mental health by positioning popular titles as restorative digital spaces rather than merely sources of distraction. Practically, the findings suggest that thoughtfully designed, low-pressure games may serve as simple, real-world tools to rekindle curiosity, uplift mood, and support resilience among young adults facing burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors thank all the study participants for their time.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AMD first entered the CPU market with reverse-engineered Intel 8080 clone 50 years ago — the Am9080 cost 50 cents apiece to make, but sold for $700&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1975, AMD could make these processors for 50 cents and sell them for $700, providing a great financial springboard to establish the company in PC CPU making.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chip which paved the way for AMD’s illustrious future, eventually creating some of the best CPUs we've ever tested, entered mass production 50 years ago. AMD’s Am9080 had something of a shady origin, as it was a reverse-engineered and cloned Intel 8080. However, due to the importance of second-sourcing among organizations that would end up buying boatloads of 8080 microprocessors (e.g., the military), Intel and AMD eventually reached a licensing agreement, and the rest, as they say, is history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Copycat origin&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Am9080 is the result of some very difficult-sounding, yet derivative, work. In the summer of 1973, during their last day working at Xerox, Ashawna Hailey, Kim Hailey, and Jay Kumar took detailed photos of an Intel 8080 pre-production sample, says Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Armed with approximately 400 detailed images, the trio managed to draft schematic and logic diagrams and then hawked them around Silicon Valley to see if anyone was interested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD took the bait, as you may have guessed, and thought the processor could be useful to run on the N-channel MOS process it had just developed. Some sources suggest that initial runs of the Am9080 were sold by AMD in 1974 — the same year Intel debuted the processor commercially. However, it would not be until 1975 that AMD marketed and mass-produced the Am9080.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Made for 50 cents, sold for $700&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pondering the information we have about how much AMD could manufacture the Am9080 for and how much they could sell it for, mass-producing these chips was a great foundation and business-building enterprise. Various sources indicate that a single Am9080 processor cost AMD only 50 cents to make (100 per wafer), yet it could sell them to military customers for $700 each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Agreement with Intel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1976, AMD was presented with another great opportunity to profit from its clone of Intel's 8080. Sidestepping interminable legal wrangling, AMD grabbed the chance to sign a cross-licensing agreement with Intel, granting them authorization to become a ‘second source.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This wasn’t done out of the goodness of Intel’s heart, of course. Some lucrative contracts (e.g., military, again) required key components to have second sources. So AMD and Intel inked a deal, which meant AMD paid Intel $25,000 on signing and $75,000 per year for licensing. The deal also released both parties from liability for past infringements.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;WikiChip (linked top) notes the agreement would become the foundation for important future accords between the chipmaking rivals, notably the expanded agreement in 1982, which allowed AMD to make its own x86 PC processors. AMD’s first chip under the expanded agreement would be its Am286 (1982), a licensed version of the Intel 80286.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Am9080 variants ran at up to 4.0 MHz&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD produced many variants of the Am9080 to propel its chip-making business forward. Of the 28 versions WikiChip lists, clock frequencies range from 2.083 to 4.0 MHz, and min/max operating temperatures range from models with a modest 0-70 degrees Celsius operating range, to the MIL-STD-883 compliant ‘AM9080ADM’ (for example), which was capable of computing in environments as cold as -70 to as hot as 125 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Am9080 chips had a significantly smaller die than the Intel 8080 that they copied. AMD’s more advanced and compact N-channel MOS fabrication process made this possible. Like now, the more advanced semiconductor process also enabled higher clocks. Intel’s 8080 processor SKUs were never produced with clock speeds above 3.125 MHz.&lt;/p&gt;

AMD documented how to create such faster Am9080, and the level of techical detail (complete microcode and schematics) was so impressive and accurate that i could code it almost verbatim into working FPGA version.Reply&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;WE HAVE MOVED TO SIMPLEX&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Anyone that agrees to our Code of Conduct is welcome to join our Simplex Hack Liberty Community Room and our Simplex server, a decentralized, metadata resistant alternative to Matrix! Incognito profiles welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why Federation Must Die&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The appeal of federation lies in its potential to empower individuals, groups, and communities by enabling the use of open-source software and facilitating decentralized interactions across servers. This model offers a degree of censorship resistance, as the messages or images are replicated across multiple servers, making it difficult for any single entity to censor or control the content.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, after over two years of administrating public federated services (Matrix, Lemmy), I’ve learned first hand the fundamental problems associated with the design of all federated protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Problems with Matrix (Protocol)&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Metadata Leakage&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Federated networks are naturally more vulnerable to metadata leaks than P2P or centralized networks. These leaks can be fixed, at the expense of increased complexity of the protocol (thus making it more vulnerable to faulty implementations). Matrix’s failure to prevent these leaks is necessary for proper functioning of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some metadata must be leaked due to features Matrix provides. For example, Matrix’s message verification requires knowing which user and device sent a message (to know which key to verify with). In other cases (such as global profile pictures and nicknames), the information is considered public anyway, and therefore has no need to be encrypted. Matrix’s failure to prevent these leaks is a triviality.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some metadata leaks are accepted for performance requirements. For example, message reactions and read receipts might not be encrypted because Matrix’s E2EE is slower than normal (non-E2EE) messaging. Encrypting reactions and read receipts could provide a painful user experience (UX). Matrix’s failure to prevent these leaks is a design feature.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some metadata leaks are simply a matter of the protocol’s failure to consider them. For example, room-specific nicknames, room-specific profile pictures, and message edit events could all be encrypted without breaking the protocol. Matrix’s failure to prevent these leaks is a design flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matrix’s E2EE does not, however, encrypt everything. The following information is not encrypted:&lt;lb/&gt; Message senders&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Message senders are never encrypted&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Due to Matrix’s design, encrypting session/device IDs would break verification&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;It’s impossible to prevent timestamps from leaking, since the server can simply note when an event is received anyway&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Join/leave/invite and other room events are never encrypted&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;While contents are not leaked, an attacker can know when messages are edited&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Reactions are never encrypted&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Read receipts are never encrypted&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Nicknames are never encrypted&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Profile pictures are never encrypted&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To demonstrate some examples of these leaks, I have made some examples available: https://snippets.serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix-metadata-leaks&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Admin in the Middle&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From What a malicious matrix homeserver admin can do:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Passive information gathering&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of passive information gathering a malicious admin can do just by querying the Synapse database and this can happen retroactively. Some of the (meta)data include:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Chat history of any unencrypted room (duh!)&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Information about the users of their homeserver (duh!), like devices, IPs, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Reactions to end-to-end-encrypted (e2ee) messages, because reactions aren’t encrypted.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Room related metadata (even for e2ee rooms), room participants and their avatars/nicks, the room topic, power levels, number of messages people sent and when, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;URL previews of shared links (if enabled on a per room setting)&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Active attacks&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A malicious admin can perform active attacks against their users and the rooms they participate in if they want. Some of them might be easy to spot from the client’s perspective, others might not.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Messing with rooms&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matrix has the notion of state events which are the events that specify what a room looks like. They specify which users are part of the room, which users are banned, the power levels of users, the name and the topic of the room, etc. These events aren’t e2ee and so, a malicious admin can both read them and send their own events by impersonating a user of their homeserver. This can mainly lead to social engineering attacks. I’ll list a few ways to social engineer and exploit people, as there are multiple ways to do so. I’ll be using @victim:example.com as the account the malicious admin is impersonating.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;React to messages as the user being impersonated. The malicious admin won’t know the content of the message they’re reacting to, but they’ll be able to see others’ reactions to it.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Set the room topic to an attacker controlled URL. Every participant in the room, regardless of homeserver, will see this as being set by &lt;code&gt;@victim:example.com&lt;/code&gt;, a user they personally trust. A drive-by attack or a leak of the IP address of third party users is possible this way.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Invite accounts into the room. The newly joined account won’t be able to read past e2ee messages, but any messages sent after they joined will be visible given the default settings of most clients.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Kick and ban people out of the room, which isn’t that bad in itself, but can be disruptive. Similarly, they can increase the power level of other users in the room.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Send tombstone events, marking the room as being replaced for most clients and prevent further message sending to it.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Messing with the user’s devices&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The above attacks can be performed simply by impersonating users without adding any new devices to their account. However, a malicious admin can simply add a new device on a user’s account, thus allowing the sending and receiving of e2ee messages.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In most clients, this will show up as an unverified device, resulting in a red shield icon to be added in the room to showcase the presence of the unverified device. My personal experience is that most people, even privacy minded tech savvy ones, simply ignore this for various reasons. I’m guilty of ignoring this as well. There’s however a per session and per room setting to disable your client from sending messages to unverified devices, if one wants to be completely safe.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In most cases, the attacked user will get a popup in their client that a new unverified device was added. There are ways to circumvent this by not reporting this new device to the user, however I don’t know if encryption will continue working properly for the user in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Protocol Weaknesses&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AI Summarized From why not matrix? – Telegraph&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Matrix is a complex communication protocol that serves as the foundation for chat applications, functioning as a distributed partially-replicated graph database. A “room” in Matrix is structured as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) composed of events, which can include messages, user states, and bans. The servers in a room aim for eventual consistency, meaning they should replicate enough state for all participants to see a similar view.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To send an event into a room, a participating server appends it to the graph. Each server must verify incoming events based on defined authentication rules, with events cryptographically signed to confirm their origin. However, there are several significant issues and risks associated with using Matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Append-only Design: Events cannot be deleted, leading to potentially endless history accumulation, which can compromise user deniability.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Redaction Limitations: Redaction events are advisory; poorly behaving servers may ignore them, retaining the original content.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Data Leakage: Servers that ignore redactions can inadvertently share supposedly deleted data with new servers joining the room.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Irreversible Events: Certain events, like membership changes, cannot be deleted as they become part of the room’s auth chain.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Spam Vulnerability: Bots can be used to spam rooms, complicating the graph and consuming server resources, necessitating room recreation to eliminate spam.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;History Linearization Challenges: Linearizing history is difficult, leading to different servers potentially seeing messages in varying orders.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Message Forging: It is possible to insert messages into history by crafting plausible events, which may go unnoticed by users.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Optional Encryption: End-to-end encryption is not mandatory, risking exposure of unencrypted messages in federated rooms.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Fragile Encryption: Encryption relies on reliable device list updates; failures can lead to broken encryption.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Device Information Leakage: Device list updates may inadvertently reveal user device information.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;API Interoperability Issues: The lack of a strict definition for canonical JSON can lead to signature mismatches between different server implementations.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Signature Check Failures: Different programming languages used for homeservers can cause JSON interoperability issues, leading to failed signature checks.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Arbitrary Signing Key Expiry: Signing keys can expire arbitrarily, causing new servers to reject events from the original server, leading to split-brained rooms.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Common Split-Brained Rooms: The consensus algorithm for resolving conflicting states is not foolproof, leading to frequent state resets.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;State Reset Chaos: State resets can occur more often with servers written in different languages, causing significant disruptions.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Loss of Admin Powers: State resets can strip room admins of their powers, making it difficult to manage rooms effectively.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Room Shutdown Limitations: A room cannot be universally shut down across the federation, which can lead to abuse.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Moderation Challenges: Effective moderation is hindered by the event auth system’s reliance on accurate state resolution.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Unauthenticated Media Uploads: Users can upload media without authentication, potentially leading to misuse of the media repository.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Media Replication Risks: Homeservers can replicate media from other servers, which could lead to denial-of-service issues.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Unverified Media Uploads: Media uploads are unverified by default, posing risks if harmful content is uploaded.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Liability for Illegal Media: Homeservers could unknowingly host illegal media due to eager replication from undesirable rooms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dubious Encryption Protocols (Megolm)&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From: https://nebuchadnezzar-megolm.github.io&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We report several practically-exploitable cryptographic vulnerabilities in the end-to-end encryption in Matrix and describe proof-of-concept attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities. When relying on implementation specific behaviour, these attacks target the Matrix standard as implemented by the &lt;code&gt;matrix-react-sdk&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;matrix-js-sdk&lt;/code&gt; libraries.1 These libraries provide the basis for the flagship Element client. The vulnerabilities we exploit differ in their nature (insecure by design, protocol confusion, lack of domain separation, implementation bugs) and are distributed broadly across the different subprotocols and libraries that make up the cryptographic core of Matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We target the setting where encrypted messaging and verification are enabled, i.e. in the presence of the strongest protections offered by the protocol. Furthermore, all attacks require cooperation of the homeserver. This is a natural threat model to consider, given that end-to-end encryption aims to provide protections against such untrusted third parties. We report the following vulnerabilities and attacks:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Simple confidentiality break&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Attack against out-of-band verification&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Semi-trusted impersonation&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Trusted impersonation&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Impersonation to confidentiality break&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;IND-CCA break&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Megolm protocol, while designed for secure group messaging within the Matrix framework, exhibits several critical weaknesses that can compromise user confidentiality and security.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Resource Consumption&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Running a public Matrix server is not cheap. Depending on the number of users, there must be multiple worker containers, effectively requiring that you run between 4 and 12 instances of synapse.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Synapse is hard drive hungry, memory hungry, relatively CPU hungry, and also uses a lot of bandwidth. Don’t expect to run this pile of bloat without throwing money at it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Data Collection&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From: https://hackea.org/notas/matrix.html:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Summary of the Notes on privacy and data collection of Matrix.org&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;matrix.org and vector.im receive a lot of private, personal and identifiable data on a regular basis, or metadata that can be used to precisely identify and/or track users/server, their social graph, usage pattern and potential location. This is possible both by the default configuration values in synapse/Riot that do not promote privacy, and by specific choices made by their developers to not disclose, inform users or resolve in a timely manner several known behaviors of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Data sent on a potential regular basis based on a common web/desktop+smartphone usage even with a self-hosted client and Homeserver:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The Matrix ID of users, usually including their username.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Email addresses, phone numbers of the user and their contacts.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Associations of Email, phone numbers with Matrix IDs.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Usage patterns of the user.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;IP address of the user, which can give more or less precise geographical location information.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The user’s devices and system information.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The other servers that users talks to.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Room IDs, potentially identifying the Direct chat ones and the other user/server.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With default settings, they allow unrestricted, non-obfuscated public access to the following potentially personal data/info:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Matrix IDs mapped to Email addresses/phone numbers added to a user’s settings.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Every file, image, video, audio that is uploaded to the Homeserver.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Profile name and avatar of users.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This time, with such an impressive collection of private data being sent to Matrix central servers, even when you use your own instance, we have to face the facts: Something is seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Matrix is not an adversarial resistant protocol that can and is being abused by many different groups.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From why not matrix? – Telegraph&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;speaking of shutting down rooms, you can’t actually force a room to be shut down across the federation. if there are three servers in a room and one of them wants to shut down the room, there’s no way to stop the other two servers from continuing along just as they were. this is good news if you care about internet freedom, sure. this is bad news if people start to abuse instances with unsavory rooms or content. in certain legislations this could present a serious problem.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;pretty much any user on your homeserver can upload media to your server’s media repository at pretty much any time, and media downloads are unauthenticated by default. as a result, you can often just generate a HTTP link to the media. someone might be using your media repository as their personal sharing box at your expense and you may not even realize. NOTE: THIS WAS RECENTLY CHANGED&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;you can also ask someone else’s homeserver to replicate media by asking that homeserver to return a copy of it. based on the content ID and the origin server name in the URL, the homeserver will download the media from the origin and likely cache it locally in the process. that could end up being a fun denial-of-service.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;in addition to that, media uploads are unverified by default. if you are running your own matrix instance, there’s a good chance that nothing is scanning that media for unsavory content (like csam or viruses) unless you have also installed a separate content scanner. this is a separate package and is not a core part of the synapse distribution, nor any other homeserver that is available today.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;actually the eager replication of media could end up potentially being quite a massive headache, since all it takes is for one of your users to request media from an undesirable room for your homeserver to also serve up copies of it, at which point you could become liable for hosting copies of illegal media like csam or copyrighted material without necessarily knowing it.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Matrix.org abuse team is notoriously unresponsive to abuse reports or even taking any steps to prevent the abuse of their servers. Because of this, the platform has turned into a safe haven for tens of thousands of pedophiles to spread illegal child abuse materials without consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Matrix is no place to build a community without being exposed to pedophiles. Even worse, they will often hop to as many servers as possible to replicate as much illegal content as possible and make it harder for a (decentralized) admin response. Every homeserver in the federation is likely hosting child sexual abuse images and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Disgusting, and the Matrix team is completely apathetic about it. Can you imagine that?&lt;/p&gt;

Due to lack of funding Tor is not considered a supported browser, there’s also no way for us to run tests against Tor as Playwright does not support it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Problems with Lemmy&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Data Replication, Moderation, and Abuse&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All the data replication and moderation issues from Matrix also apply to Lemmy. This one of the underlying flaws of all federated services. Lemmy admins can be held liable for hosting illegal content that is being replicated over the federation. It also makes Lemmy servers easy targets to be taken down by malicious adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;deFederation&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Despite being “de-centralized”, there is censorship in the form of “de-federation”, which effectively removes “wrong-think” servers from the global audience on Lemmy. Even though there is claimed decentralization, a large majority of users congregate on the same few servers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Censorship is hard, let the community do it!&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Any posts that don’t adhere to the Lemmy hive mind are immediately down voted, which is effectively a shadow ban that anyone can do by clicking the down vote button. Post that have any kind of negative score (two down votes) will be removed from the default post feed filters. (Active, Hot). This “shadowban” works to make it so 90% of the Lemmy population doesn’t see your post unless they are filtered specifically for “new” posts.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reddit and Lemmy are one big Psyop&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The entire framework of both Reddit and Lemmy do nothing but help to promote group think and propaganda. Any posts that don’t adhere to group think will be shunned and hidden. Post “scores” are a manipulation tactic used to influence (you) into being biased before you’ve even looked at the post. Manipulating upvotes and downvotes is trivially easy for really anyone, and it’s abused by governments and corporations to create manufactured consensus and trick you into believing that the “herd” thinks a certain way. Of course, having a lot of upvotes appeals to the most pathetic of egos, and the psyop continues with more incentivized group-think posts in a never ending cycle of garbage user generated content.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why use SimpleX&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SimpleX unique approach to privacy and security&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Everyone should care about privacy and security of their communications - even ordinary conversations can put you in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Full privacy of your identity, profile, contacts and metadata&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unlike any other existing messaging platform, SimpleX has no identifiers assigned to the users - it does not use phone numbers (like Signal or WhatsApp), domain-based addresses (like email, XMPP or Matrix), usernames (like Telegram), public keys or even random numbers (like all other messengers) to identify its users - we do not even know how many people use SimpleX.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To deliver the messages instead of user identifiers that all other platforms use, SimpleX uses the addresses of unidirectional (simplex) message queues. Using SimpleX is like having a different email address or a phone number for each contact you have, but without the hassle of managing all these addresses. In the near future SimpleX apps will also change the message queues automatically, moving the conversations from one server to another, to provide even better privacy to the users.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This approach protects the privacy of who are you communicating with, hiding it from SimpleX platform servers and from any observers. You can further improve your privacy by configuring your network access to connect to SimpleX servers via some overlay transport network, e.g. Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The best protection against spam and abuse&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As you have no identifier on SimpleX platform, you cannot be contacted unless you share a one-time invitation link or an optional temporary user address. Even with the optional user addresses, while they can be used to send spam contact requests, you can change or completely delete it without losing any of your connections.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Complete ownership, control and security of your data&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SimpleX stores all user data on client devices, the messages are only held temporarily on SimpleX relay servers until they are received.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We use portable database format that can be used on all supported devices - we will soon add the ability to export the chat database from the mobile app so it can be used on another device.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unlike servers of federated networks (email, XMPP or Matrix), SimpleX servers do not store user accounts, they simply relay messages to the recipients, protecting the privacy of both parties. There are no identifiers or encrypted messages in common between sent and received traffic of the server, thanks to the additional encryption layer for delivered messages. So if anybody is observing server traffic, they cannot easily determine who is communicating with whom (see SimpleX whitepaper for the known traffic correlation attacks).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Users own SimpleX network&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can use SimpleX with your own servers and still communicate with people using the servers that are pre-configured in the apps or any other SimpleX servers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SimpleX platform uses an open protocol and provides SDK to create chat bots, allowing implementation of services that users can interact with via SimpleX Chat apps – we are really looking forward to see what SimpleX services can be built.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you are considering developing with the SimpleX platform, whether for chat bot services for SimpleX app users or to integrate the SimpleX Chat library into your mobile apps, please get in touch for any advice and support.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comparison with P2P messaging protocols&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are several P2P chat/messaging protocols and implementations that aim to solve privacy and centralisation problem, but they have their own set of problems that makes them less reliable than the proposed design, more complex to implement and analyse and more vulnerable to attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;P2P networks use some variant of DHT to route messages/requests through the network. DHT implementations have complex designs that have to balance reliability, delivery guarantee and latency. The proposed design has both better delivery guarantees and lower latency (the message is passed multiple times in parallel, through one node each time, using servers chosen by the recipient, while in P2P networks the message is passed through &lt;code&gt;O(log N)&lt;/code&gt; nodes sequentially, using nodes chosen by the algorithm).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The proposed design, unlike most P2P networks, has no global user identifiers of any kind, even temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;P2P itself does not solve MITM attack problem, and most existing solutions do not use out-of-band messages for the initial key exchange. The proposed design uses out-of-band messages or, in some cases, pre-existing secure and trusted connections for the initial key exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;P2P implementations can be blocked by some Internet providers (like BitTorrent). The proposed design is transport agnostic - it can work over standard web protocols, and the servers can be deployed on the same domains as the websites.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;All known P2P networks are likely to be vulnerable to Sybil attack, because each node is discoverable, and the network operates as a whole. Known measures to reduce the probability of the Sybil attack either require a centralized component or expensive proof of work. The proposed design, on the opposite, has no server discoverability - servers are not connected, not known to each other and to all clients. The SimpleX network is fragmented and operates as multiple isolated connections. It makes network-wide attacks on SimpleX network impossible - even if some servers are compromised, other parts of the network can operate normally, and affected clients can switch to using other servers without losing contacts or messages.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;P2P networks are likely to be vulnerable to DRDoS attack. In the proposed design clients only relay traffic from known trusted connection and cannot be used to reflect and amplify the traffic in the whole network.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My 2026 Open Social Web Predictions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just finished reviewing my 2025 predictions (how do you think I did grading myself?) www.timothychambers.net/2024/12/2…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to make some bets for 2026. I do this not to prove how great my prognostication muscles are, but to shine a spotlight on trends I think are vital, spur discussions, and give some attention to projects that have earned it. As always, I try to make these as quantifiable, verifiable and crisp as I can. Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🌱 MILD&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safe bets — would be surprising if these DON’T happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Bluesky will cross 60 million registered users in 2026. Growth will slow from 2024’s explosive pace but remain steady, driven by continued X dissatisfaction and improved features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ The ActivityPub Fediverse (excluding Threads) will cross 15 million registered users, monthly active users (excluding will plateau around 2-3 million. Another good year in terms of stable base, but no big waves of new users. Both Bluesky and Fediverse growth won’t come from big waves of migration this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Any smaller waves from X/Twitter or from a newly bought TikTok will benefit Meta (Threads/IG), BlueSky, and Fediverse in that order. I see nothing that would change that prediction that was true last year, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Threads will pass 500 million monthly active users and remain the largest ActivityPub-adjacent platform by a wide margin. But see the next prediction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Threads federation will remain partial, and opt-in through all of 2026. Full two-way federation will NOT ship in 2026 but may move from about 90 percent there, to 95 percent done, inching forward but not finalized and prioritized as a feature. As Manton wrote, that’s better than fully closed, and better than them stripping it out. (which they might do but I’m predicting not) My bet: the status quo continues. www.manton.org/2025/12/1…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Ghost’s ActivityPub integration will bring 75,000+ new federated accounts to the Fediverse and Ghost will finish 2026 in the top 10 Fediverse server software by MAU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ WordPress-based federated accounts will cross 50,000 as measured by FediDB. Currently at approximately 26,000 accounts across 12,700 servers, the WordPress-to-Fediverse pipeline becomes a meaningful growth contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🔥 MEDIUM-SPICEY Plausible bets — could go either way, but evidence points toward yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ BridgyFed will shift to “opt-out” for Bluesky users bridging to ActivityPub — and the discourse will be far less contentious than the 2024 debates predicted. Cross-protocol interoperability quietly normalizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ At least one fully independent ATProto stack — PDS, Relay, and AppView operating without dependency on Bluesky PBC infrastructure — will achieve viability in 2026, meaning it has paying customers or sustainable funding. This will be the year ATProto proves (or fails to prove) it can exist beyond Bluesky-the-company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Mastodon gGmbH will hit key sustainability milestones in 2026. Their hosting revenue model will exceed internal targets, the new organizational structure will unlock additional grant funding (beyond NGI/NLnet), and the pace of Mastodon development will noticeably accelerate — shipping more significant features in 2026 than in the previous two years combined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Bluesky PBC will raise another round of funding in 2026 and announce more details on a proposed business model. Following their $15M Series A (October 2024), the company will close a larger round to extend runway. The announced business model will NOT be advertising-based. I’d expect subscriptions, marketplace fees, or enterprise services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ The first “ATProto-native” social app that is NOT microblogging will cross 100,000 users. Whether it’s Frontpage (link aggregation), Leaflet (long-form), Smoke Signal, or something new — the ATmosphere diversifies beyond Bluesky-the-app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Flipboard’s Surf app will launch its 1.0 version in 2026 and cross 1 million downloads across iOS and Android by year end, with 100,000+ monthly active users. It will become the most-downloaded dedicated Open Social Web client, surpassing Mastodon’s official app and Graysky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Fedify will power the federation layer for at least one mid-sized social platform (500K+ users) that adds ActivityPub support in 2026. The “build vs. buy” calculation for federation shifts decisively toward “just use Fedify.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Fediscovery will ship in a stable Mastodon release in 2026, moving from behind feature flags to production-ready. The specifications for pluggable discovery providers — covering account search, follow recommendations, and trends — will reach 1.0 status, and at least one public Fediscovery-compatible provider will launch for general use. Small instance operators will finally have a real option to improve discovery without running their own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ The new “ActivityRank” algorithm in Loops will prove that ethical recommendations and decentralization can coexist. Dan Supernault’s approach — where each instance trains its own algorithm while surfacing content across the ActivityPub network — will be recognized as a breakthrough in solving the fediverse’s discoverability problem. By the end of 2026, the pattern will be studied or adopted by at least two other ActivityPub platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ ATProto will advance from Internet Drafts to an official IETF Working Group in 2026. Following the September 2025 submission of initial specifications, Bluesky will secure enough support and independent implementers to form a dedicated Working Group — moving from “proposal being discussed” to “standard being formally developed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🌶️ SPICY Hot takes - a bit more risky - but I’m calling my shot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ A well-known digital-native media publication (10M+ monthly visitors) will federate via ActivityPub in 2026 and publicly share positive results. Whether through Ghost, WordPress, or custom implementation, this outlet will report that federated followers drove meaningful engagement — making the business case for federation legible to other publishers for the first time. By year end, at least two additional publications will announce federation plans, citing this pioneer as proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ At least one major news organization (top 50 US by traffic) will announce it is leaving X/Twitter entirely and making Bluesky or the Fediverse its primary social distribution channel. The “institutional exodus” begins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ At least one major national government or major city will launch an official presence on BOTH Bluesky AND the ActivityPub Fediverse in 2026 — and it will be a European government. Expect surprising additional early adopters after this from Latin America, Asia-Pacific, or Africa to follow that lead and make moves that year to do the same. This is the year the move to “digital sovereignty" from US tech will benefit the open social web. Eurosky will inch along with some promise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Nostr ↔ ATProto ↔ ActivityPub three-way bridging becomes functional via BridgyFed or another service by end of 2026. The “protocol wars” narrative collapses into “just pick your client.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ AltStore will be live with Federation features in at least 5 countries by end of 2026 (currently EU + Japan, with Brazil, Australia, UK announced). AltStore is an independent iOS app marketplace created by Riley Testut and Shane Gill — the first major alternative to Apple’s App Store, made possible by the EU’s Digital Markets Act. The federated app marketplace model will prove viable outside Europe, challenging Apple’s App Store dominance in multiple regulatory regimes simultaneously. Their ActivityPub integration — where app updates flow to Mastodon, Threads, and Bluesky — will become the most compelling non-social-media use case for decentrlized social features, proving definitively that such protocols extends beyond microblogging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Loops will become the third most-used Fediverse software by MAU by end of 2026, trailing only Mastodon and Pixelfed. The short-form video platform will cross 100,000 monthly active users, with Loops-originated content generating significant federated engagement from non-Loops clients — proving that ActivityPub can power video-centric social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ PieFed will emerge as the most feature-rich Threadiverse platform by end of 2026, surpassing Lemmy and Mbin in moderation tools, user experience, and federation capabilities. The platform will cross 10,000 monthly active users and its rapid development pace — shipping major features weekly — will make it the default recommendation for anyone starting a new Reddit-style community in the fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ More laws akin to Utah’s Digital Choice Act will pass or advance - sparking first steps towards interoperability to mainstream US discourse. The Utah law takes effect July 1, 2026, and several other states will pass similar ones, requiring social media platforms to enable data portability and interoperability. At least one major platform will announce ActivityPub or AT Protocol support to comply. The “Digital Choice” framing will prove more politically viable than “antitrust” for breaking Big Tech’s lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What did I miss? What did I get wrong? Let me know — and I’ll see you in December 2026 to grade these.&lt;/p&gt;

Gox CEO Karpelès Reveals Details of 2014 Collapse and Japanese Detention</title><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/former-mt-gox-ceo-mark-karpeles-reveals-details-of-2014-collapse-and-japanese-detention</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="1af7597102a70f76"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2025, Mark Karpelès, ex CEO of Mt. Gox, lives a quieter life in Japan, building a VPN and an AI automation platform. As Chief Protocol Officer at vp.net—a VPN that uses Intel’s SGX technology to let users verify exactly what code runs on servers—he works alongside Roger Ver and Andrew Lee, the founder of Private Internet Access. “It’s the only VPN that you can trust basically. You don’t need to trust it, actually, you can verify”. At shells.com, his personal cloud computing platform, he’s quietly developing an unreleased AI agent system that hands artificial intelligence full control over a virtual machine: installing software, managing emails, and even handling purchases with a planned credit card integration. “What I’m doing with shells is giving AI a whole computer and free rein on the computer”, a brilliant idea, really. AI agents on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contrast with his past could not be starker. Fifteen years ago, Karpelès was the reluctant king of Bitcoin’s trading world, running Mt. Gox at a time when the exchange processed the vast majority of global bitcoin trades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His journey began innocently enough in 2010. Operating a web hosting company called Tibanne under the brand Kalyhost, Karpelès received a request from a French customer based in Peru who was frustrated with international payment hurdles. “He’s the one who discovered Bitcoin, and asked me if he could use Bitcoin to pay for my services … I was probably one of the first companies to implement Bitcoin payments back in 2010”.&lt;lb/&gt;Roger Ver, an early evangelist, became a frequent visitor to Karpelès’ office. Unknowingly, his servers also hosted a domain linked to Silk Road—silkroadmarket.org—purchased anonymously with bitcoin. That connection would later fuel investigations: U.S. authorities briefly suspected Karpelès of being Dread Pirate Roberts himself. “That was actually one of the main arguments why I was investigated by U.S. law enforcement as maybe the guy behind the Silk Road… They thought that I was Dread Pirate Roberts”. The association complicated public perception and even surfaced in Ross Ulbricht’s trial, where, according to Karpelès, Ulbricht’s defense efforts briefly tried to cast doubt by linking Karpelès to the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Karpelès acquired Mt. Gox from Jed McCaleb, who went on to found Ripple and Stellar. The handover was marred from the start. “Between the time I signed the contract and the time I got access to the server, 80,000 bitcoins were stolen… Jed was adamant that we couldn’t tell users about it,” Karpelès alleged to Bitcoin Magazine. McCaleb faced no criminal liability for the Mt. Gox case, though he has been sued civilly and has been part of the public discourse around the case. Nevertheless, as far as Karpelès is concerned, he inherited a platform plagued by poor code and technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mt. Gox exploded in popularity, becoming the primary on-ramp for millions entering Bitcoin. Karpelès maintained strict policies, banning users linked to illicit activities like drug purchases on Silk Road. “If you’re going to buy drugs with Bitcoin, in a country where drugs are illegal, you shouldn’t”, Karpelès told Bitcoin Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mt. Gox empire crumbled in 2014 when hacks—later tied to Alexander Vinnik and the BTC-e exchange—drained over 650,000 bitcoins. Vinnik pleaded guilty in the U.S. but was exchanged in a prisoner swap and returned to Russia without a trial, leaving evidence sealed. “It doesn’t feel like justice has been served,” said Karpelès, a moment that makes you wonder about the odd political value of Vinnik to the Russians. The 650,000 bitcoins stolen remain at large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fallout was swift. Arrested in August 2015, Karpelès endured eleven and a half months in Japanese custody—a system notorious for its rigidity and psychological pressure. Early detention mixed him with colorful cellmates: Yakuza members, drug dealers, fraudsters. He passed the time teaching English, and inmates quickly dubbed him “Mr. Bitcoin” after spotting blanked-out headlines about him in newspapers given to them by the prison guards. One Yakuza even tried recruiting him, slipping a phone number for post-release contact. “… Of course I’m not going to be calling that,” Karpelès laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The psychological tactics were brutal. Japanese police employed repeated rearrests: after 23 days, detainees were led to believe release was imminent, only to face a new warrant at the door. “They really make you think that you’re free and yeah, no, not you’re not free… That’s actually quite a toll in terms of mental health”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transferred to Tokyo Detention Center, conditions worsened: over six months in solitary confinement on a floor shared with death row inmates. “It’s still quite painful to spend more than six months in solitary confinement,” he recalled. Forbidden from letters or visits if claiming innocence, he coped by rereading books and writing stories—”the stuff I wrote is really crappy. I wouldn’t show it to anyone,” he said when asked if he would ever publish his writings. Armed with 20,000 pages of accounting records and a basic calculator purchased for his case, he dismantled embezzlement charges by uncovering $5 million in unreported revenue in the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, prison improved his health dramatically. Chronic sleep deprivation—often just two hours a night during his workaholic Mt. Gox days—gave way to regular rest. “Sleeping at night helps a lot… when I work I’m used to only sleeping two hours a night, which is a very, very bad habit” (00:22:18). Emerging physically transformed—”shredded,” as observers noted at the time—he surprised the Bitcoin community with fresh photos showing peak condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Released on bail after disproving key charges, Karpelès was convicted only on lighter record-falsification counts at the end of the ordeal. The Silk Road links had complicated perceptions, with Ross Ulbricht’s defense briefly attempting to implicate him to create plausible deniability for Ulbricht. Public narratives often painted him as complicit in Bitcoin’s dark side, despite his policies against it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emerging in 2016, rumors swirled of vast personal wealth from Mt. Gox’s remaining assets—once estimated at hundreds of millions or even billions due to Bitcoin’s price surge. Yet Karpelès says he receives nothing. The bankruptcy’s pivot to civil rehabilitation allowed creditors to claim in bitcoins, distributing value proportionally. I like to use technology to solve problems, and so I don’t really even do any kind of investment or anything like that because I like to make money by constructing things. To just get a payout for something that’s essentially a failure for me would feel very wrong, and at the same time, I’d want customers to get the money as much as possible.” Creditors, many now receiving far more in dollar terms due to Bitcoin’s rise, continue waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Karpelès collaborates with Roger Ver—the early visitor turned business partner—who recently settled U.S. tax claims for nearly $50 million. “I’m happy for him that he’s finally getting things cleared,” Karpelès said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Karpelès says he owns no bitcoin personally, though his businesses accept it as a form of payment. Discussing the current state of Bitcoin, he critiqued centralization risks in ETFs and figures like Michael Saylor: “This is a recipe for catastrophe… I like to believe in crypto in mathematics and different things, but I don’t believe in people”. On FTX: “They were running accounting on QuickBooks for a potentially multi-billion dollar company, which is crazy”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Bitcoin’s epicenter—hosting Silk Road links, onboarding the world, enduring Japan’s harshest detention—to building verifiable privacy tools, Karpelès’ arc reflects the industry’s maturation. His story marks the first roar of Bitcoin into mainstream culture, a time when his leadership as CEO of Mt. Gox placed him at the center of the storm. Clearest of all, his builder mindset remains a great example of the type of engineer and entrepreneur attracted to Bitcoin in those early days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SPICE, the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuits Emphasis, has turned 40 years old. The IEEE has marked the occasion by designating the development of SPICE as a Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing. On February 23rd, the Computer History Museum hosted a celebration with a roundtable discussion by the individuals most responsible for bringing SPICE from its origin as a UC Berkeley student project to the huge commercial success it has achieved as the most widely used tool in the semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The panel (from left to right, apologies for the poor quality picture from my iPhone) consisted of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ron Rohrer – 2002 Kaufman Award recipient, who taught the class at UCB that developed the progenitor of SPICE, CANCER (Computer Analysis of Nonlinear Circuits, Excluding Radiation)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Larry Nagel – as a student in Ron’s class, Larry took on CANCER as his Master’s degree project, and eventually developed the 1st successful implementation – SPICE2 – as his doctoral thesis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kim Hailey – co-founder (with Shawn Hailey) of Meta-Software, where HSPICE was created.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ken Kundert – who led the development of Cadence’s Spectre simulator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;David Hodges – Distinguished Professor Emeritus at UCB, the panel moderator, who is well known for leading the development of analog IC design in CMOS and for the original (Level-1) Shichman-Hodges MOS device model.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have benefited greatly from connections with each of these individuals throughout my career. My first connection with Ron was at SMU when I was completing my MSEE degree and he was chairman and dean of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. (Where, incidentally, he was also thesis advisor to Synopsys founder Aart de Geus) . Later, Ron went on to what was then GE-Calma while I was at the GE Corporate R&amp;amp;D Labs. Later, he became chairman of analog layout synthesis startup Neolinear, which was eventually acquired by Cadence. Ron helped me get my job at Cadence as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My transition from IC design to EDA started with establishing the East Coast sales office for Meta-Software, but I first met the Haileys when I was at GE. We eventually made HSPICE GE’s corporate simulator, after a difficult internal battle to convince developers to give up on creating a GE-SPICE. That battle involved digging into Larry Nagel’s SPICE2 thesis, to better understand the convergence issues we were having with our copy of Berkeley SPICE. HSPICE fixed that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ironically, Larry later led a simulation and characterization group at Anadigics that became one of our HSPICE customers. I met Ken when we were both at Cadence, and have also done work with him at his current company – Designer’s Guide Consulting. And of course, as a CMOS analog IC designer, I have poured through papers and books authored by David Hodges many, many times. At GE CR&amp;amp;D we worked with Prof. Hodges and his students to better understand design and test methods for A/D converters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it’s fair to say that if you’ve even been involved with designing an integrated circuit in any way, you have also had a connection to SPICE and these individuals, whether you realize it or not. As Ron pointed out, if you are a digital designer, your ‘.lib’ file is the result of a lot of SPICE characterization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The roundtable was a lively, and often humorous, look back at how SPICE became such a big success. Ron Rohrer was on leave to Fairchild to help them simulate some of the early integrated circuits. He was brought back to UCB to teach a class on what was supposed to be “circuit synthesis”. Since he was still working full time at Fairchild, he decided that the only way to do both jobs was to tell the class “you guys are going to write a circuit simulator. If you create the best circuit simulator in the world I will give you all ‘A’s. And.. if you don’t.. I am going to give you an oral final. ” Ron went on to say that his oral finals were infamous, and the students often described them more colorfully as something a bit more painful than an oral exam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a mechanical engineer who signed up for the class complained – “What can I do, I don’t know anything about circuits and you certainly aren’t teaching us anything “, Ron joked that he told him “What ’s new, I have tenure… I don’t have to teach anything !” Instead, he suggested that the student look into sparse matrix techniques, and that turned out to be one of the most significant advances to came from the project. Sparse matrix techniques made SPICE more efficient, taking it well beyond what Ron originally had in mind when he limited circuit size to 50 nodes and 200 devices, figuring “that would be enough for all time for that mode of simulation “.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Larry Nagel agreed that sparse matrix methods were key. At the time of the original SPICE development, the UCB students had limited access to what was then the 2nd most powerful computer in the world; a CDC-6400 with 200K octal words of memory (64k binary words), half of it consumed by the operating system. Running off of a blazing 10MHz clock, this was a $6M machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The open source mandate of a publicly-funded project like SPICE was even more critical to its success. Larry saw some parallels to the success of BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) Unix, which came much later. SPICE became a learning tool for all EE students at UCB, so that when they went off to work in industry they took SPICE with them. Students also became professors, teaching their students at other schools. SPICE took off exponentially. In Larry’s words, it built up an audience of people who knew SPICE, but they also needed more capability. The free labor from students who continued to develop and enhance SPICE played a large role. This was contrasted with the ECAP circuit analysis program that had been developed by IBM, which was offered for free to stimulate use of the company’s hardware. Even though the software was free, hardly anyone used it. While Berkeley was sometimes criticized for not locking down their IP in SPICE, the ecosystem would not have grown otherwise. David Hodges cited this as a lesson in the benefits of projects enabled by public grants. While Digital Equipment Corporation credited SPICE with selling 1000 VAXs, the benefits were returned when they funded the 5th floor addition to Cory Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ecosystem grew because of parallel for-profit efforts and free open source. Meta Software was most successful at commercializing SPICE, from a magnetic tape copy that was purchased for only $6.50 from the university. Kim Hailey humorously noted that when he and Shawn started Meta, one of the things they had found that was “left out from SPICE was a price tag “. The Haileys found that companies were beginning to spend a lot of money on running SPICE through time-sharing services on mainframe computers. As the dawn of the mini-computer revolution was just appearing, computers became more available to engineers. Meta Software exploited the opportunity by developing ports for HSPICE on new machines from Cray, DEC, Data General and others. At one point, Meta Software had ports of HSPICE on 22 different machines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The availability of HSPICE and minicomputers made it possible for engineers to work more efficiently. As Kim said, it was all about the ecosystem as Meta got a lot of feedback from engineers that allowed them to make ongoing improvements. This established a relationship of trust and credibility. As the ecosystem started to build up engineers needed device models for their fabrication processes. Meta smartly established the capability to design and test chips (the Meta test chip ) that would be used to deliver models that were guaranteed to work in HSPICE. They would also license the test chip for companies to build in their fabs. As the fabless semiconductor model eventually dominated over the IDMs (integrated device manufacturers), Meta’s relationship with the foundries meant that purchasing HSPICE was nearly mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta Software’ business model and role in the ecosystem made their product “sticky”, binding engineers in a relationship to the company and to HSPICE. The success of the business model was due in large part to the support that a for-profit enterprise like Meta could give. There were internal efforts for in-house SPICE at some (mostly large) companies, but every time they choked on a design it provided an opportunity for Meta to show their ability. As Kim said, “engineers just needed tools that worked “, and if there was a problem Meta Software got a reputation for being able to fix it. By the time of the company’s acquisition by Avant!, over 11,000 copies of HSPICE had been sold. There was no problem for Meta Software to work alongside the free unsupported version of SPICE. The relationship was synergistic. For Meta, the free version of SPICE was like “training wheels”. It provided a starting point for engineers to learn simulation techniques, which Kim referred to as a “win-win” situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ken Kundert noted just how strong the HSPICE franchise had begun, recalling that when he first developed Spectre at Cadence he quickly found that trying to compete with HSPICE was “not an easy task “. Eventually Spectre developed a more differentiated complete product solution through integration of Spectre with other tools in the Cadence Design Framework and Analog Artist, which was followed by Spectre-HDL, Verilog-A and Verilog-AMS and Spectre-RF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The value of the open source efforts that came from the original CANCER class project is probably immeasurable, not only in the EDA industry but also in the numerous semiconductor companies that have depended on some variation of SPICE for 40 years. Each of the panelists at the Computer Museum celebration of the 40th Anniversary of SPICE has authored an article on the topic to be published in an upcoming issue of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine. A video recording of the proceeding will also be uploaded by the Computer History Museum in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

It brings together and extends ideas from Semantic Kernel and AutoGen projects, combining their strengths while adding new capabilities. Built by the same teams, it is the unified foundation for building AI agents going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent Framework offers two primary categories of capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI agents: Individual agents that use LLMs to process user inputs, call tools and MCP servers to perform actions, and generate responses. Agents support model providers including Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, and Azure AI.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Workflows: Graph-based workflows that connect multiple agents and functions to perform complex, multi-step tasks. Workflows support type-based routing, nesting, checkpointing, and request/response patterns for human-in-the-loop scenarios.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The framework also provides foundational building blocks, including model clients (chat completions and responses), an agent thread for state management, context providers for agent memory, middleware for intercepting agent actions, and MCP clients for tool integration. Together, these components give you the flexibility and power to build interactive, robust, and safe AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why another agent framework?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Semantic Kernel and AutoGen pioneered the concepts of AI agents and multi-agent orchestration. The Agent Framework is the direct successor, created by the same teams. It combines AutoGen's simple abstractions for single- and multi-agent patterns with Semantic Kernel's enterprise-grade features such as thread-based state management, type safety, filters, telemetry, and extensive model and embedding support. Beyond merging the two, Agent Framework introduces workflows that give developers explicit control over multi-agent execution paths, plus a robust state management system for long-running and human-in-the-loop scenarios. In short, Agent Framework is the next generation of both Semantic Kernel and AutoGen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To learn more about migrating from either Semantic Kernel or AutoGen, see the Migration Guide from Semantic Kernel and Migration Guide from AutoGen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Semantic Kernel and AutoGen have benefited significantly from the open-source community, and the same is expected for Agent Framework. Microsoft Agent Framework welcomes contributions and will keep improving with new features and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Agent Framework is currently in public preview. Please submit any feedback or issues on the GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you use Microsoft Agent Framework to build applications that operate with third-party servers or agents, you do so at your own risk. We recommend reviewing all data being shared with third-party servers or agents and being cognizant of third-party practices for retention and location of data. It is your responsibility to manage whether your data will flow outside of your organization's Azure compliance and geographic boundaries and any related implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install agent-framework --pre
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.NET:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI Agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is an AI agent?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An AI agent uses an LLM to process user inputs, make decisions, call tools and MCP servers to perform actions, and generate responses. The following diagram illustrates the core components and their interactions in an AI agent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An AI agent can also be augmented with additional components such as a thread, a context provider, and middleware to enhance its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When to use an AI agent?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents are suitable for applications that require autonomous decision-making, ad hoc planning, trial-and-error exploration, and conversation-based user interactions. They are particularly useful for scenarios where the input task is unstructured and cannot be easily defined in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some common scenarios where AI agents excel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Customer Support: AI agents can handle multi-modal queries (text, voice, images) from customers, use tools to look up information, and provide natural language responses.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Education and Tutoring: AI agents can leverage external knowledge bases to provide personalized tutoring and answer student questions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code Generation and Debugging: For software developers, AI agents can assist with implementation, code reviews, and debugging by using various programming tools and environments.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Research Assistance: For researchers and analysts, AI agents can search the web, summarize documents, and piece together information from multiple sources.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key is that AI agents are designed to operate in a dynamic and underspecified setting, where the exact sequence of steps to fulfill a user request is not known in advance and might require exploration and close collaboration with users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When not to use an AI agent?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents are not well-suited for tasks that are highly structured and require strict adherence to predefined rules. If your application anticipates a specific kind of input and has a well-defined sequence of operations to perform, using AI agents might introduce unnecessary uncertainty, latency, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can write a function to handle the task, do that instead of using an AI agent. You can use AI to help you write that function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single AI agent might struggle with complex tasks that involve multiple steps and decision points. Such tasks might require a large number of tools (for example, over 20), which a single agent cannot feasibly manage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these cases, consider using workflows instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Workflows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is a Workflow?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A workflow can express a predefined sequence of operations that can include AI agents as components while maintaining consistency and reliability. Workflows are designed to handle complex and long-running processes that might involve multiple agents, human interactions, and integrations with external systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The execution sequence of a workflow can be explicitly defined, allowing for more control over the execution path. The following diagram illustrates an example of a workflow that connects two AI agents and a function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workflows can also express dynamic sequences using conditional routing, model-based decision making, and concurrent execution. This is how multi-agent orchestration patterns are implemented. The orchestration patterns provide mechanisms to coordinate multiple agents to work on complex tasks that require multiple steps and decision points, addressing the limitations of single agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What problems do Workflows solve?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workflows provide a structured way to manage complex processes that involve multiple steps, decision points, and interactions with various systems or agents. The types of tasks workflows are designed to handle often require more than one AI agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key benefits of Agent Framework workflows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modularity: Workflows can be broken down into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to manage and update individual parts of the process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Agent Integration: Workflows can incorporate multiple AI agents alongside non-agentic components, allowing for sophisticated orchestration of tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Type Safety: Strong typing ensures messages flow correctly between components, with comprehensive validation that prevents runtime errors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexible Flow: Graph-based architecture allows for intuitive modeling of complex workflows with &lt;code&gt;executors&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;edges&lt;/code&gt;. Conditional routing, parallel processing, and dynamic execution paths are all supported.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;External Integration: Built-in request/response patterns enable seamless integration with external APIs and support human-in-the-loop scenarios.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Checkpointing: Save workflow states via checkpoints, enabling recovery and resumption of long-running processes on the server side.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Agent Orchestration: Built-in patterns for coordinating multiple AI agents, including sequential, concurrent, hand-off, and Magentic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Composability: Workflows can be nested or combined to create more complex processes, allowing for scalability and adaptability.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Browser automation without the drama.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibium is browser automation infrastructure built for AI agents. A single binary handles browser lifecycle, WebDriver BiDi protocol, and exposes an MCP server — so Claude Code (or any MCP client) can drive a browser with zero setup. Works great for AI agents, test automation, and anything else that needs a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single Go binary (~10MB) that does everything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browser Management: Detects/launches Chrome with BiDi enabled&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BiDi Proxy: WebSocket server that routes commands to browser&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP Server: stdio interface for LLM agents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auto-Wait: Polls for elements before interacting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Screenshots: Viewport capture as PNG&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design goal: The binary is invisible. JS developers just &lt;code&gt;npm install vibium&lt;/code&gt; and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Option 1: require (REPL-friendly)
const { browserSync } = require('vibium')

// Option 2: dynamic import (REPL with --experimental-repl-await)
const { browser } = await import('vibium')

// Option 3: static import (in .mjs or .ts files)
import { browser, browserSync } from 'vibium'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sync API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const fs = require('fs')
const { browserSync } = require('vibium')

const vibe = browserSync.launch()
vibe.go('https://example.com')

const png = vibe.screenshot()
fs.writeFileSync('screenshot.png', png)

const link = vibe.find('a')
link.click()
vibe.quit()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Async API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const fs = await import('fs/promises')
const { browser } = await import('vibium')

const vibe = await browser.launch()
await vibe.go('https://example.com')

const png = await vibe.screenshot()
await fs.writeFile('screenshot.png', png)

const link = await vibe.find('a')
await link.click()
await vibe.quit()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One command to add browser control to Claude Code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;claude mcp add vibium -- npx -y vibium&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it. No manual steps needed. Chrome downloads automatically during setup.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;code&gt;browser_launch&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Start browser (visible by default)&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_find&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Find element by CSS selector&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_click&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Click an element&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_type&lt;/code&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_screenshot&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Capture viewport (base64 or save to file with &lt;code&gt;--screenshot-dir&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_quit&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Close browser&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install vibium&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This automatically:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot has changed since I last wrote about Value Study, my little app for artists, back in 2022. I’ve broken one of my five intentions, and I don’t regret it. The app is now used regularly worldwide, in multiple languages, across Android and iOS, with a handful of users on macOS too. What started as a small idea to help improve my own art has grown into a tool recommended by art teachers and used by people far beyond what I ever expected. That will forever humble me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My original plan was for the app to be free. It was one of the five intentions I laid out in that 2022 article. Part of that came from worrying people would think I was a fraud if I charged for it, especially as I’m no art expert. It’s still important to me that the app remains affordable to anyone who wants to use it. But as an income stream, that means relying on reaching many people rather than charging a lot to a small group of loyal customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking back, I’m glad I framed these ideas as intentions rather than rigid core values. Intentions allow room to adapt. They make it easier to acknowledge when something needs to change. So I’ve updated that intention from free to affordable. That small shift gave me permission, mostly to myself, to be paid for my effort without it feeling like greed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we approach the New Year and head into 2026, my focus is on quality above all else. We live in a world where apps can be built in days rather than months using AI. I’ve been working on Value Study since 2020, and I’ve spent countless hours trying to make it the best it can be. I still believe people want to support independent developers, especially those who are hands-on and care deeply about what they’re making. In practical terms, this means I’ll soon be releasing version 1.0 of Value Study for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Android version has been in early access for much of this year. It was highly requested, along with Grid mode, which I also released this year. While the app has been available for a while, this release feels symbolic. It marks Value Study for Android as “stable”. That doesn’t mean finished or bug-free, but it does mean it’s broadly on par with iOS in terms of features and overall quality. It also reflects a shift in usage. For a long time Android represented only a tiny fraction of users, but things are now far more evenly split.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Android has been hard. I knew it would be, but I still underestimated it. There’s a reason many developers avoid it. It’s not that iOS is better, both platforms are excellent these days. And it’s not just fragmentation, though that certainly doesn’t help when there are so many devices and configurations to account for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real difficulty is mindset. Maybe it’s because Google gives so much away for free, or because Android phones can be significantly cheaper. But even among flagship Android users, there’s a strong resistance to paying for apps. It’s not just that fewer people buy the app. Reviews are often far more critical without being constructive. Seeing one-star reviews that simply say “it costs money, don’t download” is disheartening, especially when the app is clearly labelled as paid and costs very little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the purchasing data revealed something interesting. Value Study offers two options: a lifetime purchase for under $10, or a yearly subscription of around $2. On iOS, the split is fairly even. Most people who download the app pay, and it’s roughly fifty–fifty between lifetime and yearly. On Android, it’s very different. Only a small percentage of users convert to paid, but among those who do, lifetime purchases dominate. iOS users seem far more comfortable with subscriptions than Android users, which is the opposite of what I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another challenge with Android is maintaining multiple codebases. I made a conscious decision to keep everything native: iOS in Swift and Android in Kotlin. I could have gone cross-platform, but I didn’t want to. The trade-off is keeping features in sync and tracking bugs across two separate implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is one area where AI has helped. I can point Claude Code at both codebases and work on one while syncing changes to the other. It’s not magic and it’s not painless, but it’s a practical use of modern tools that saves time without compromising quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I’m on the subject of tooling, a few shout-outs are deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, RevenueCat. For a long time I didn’t understand why so many indie developers used it. When I was iOS-only, I assumed I could hand-roll everything with StoreKit 2. The number of edge cases quickly proved that assumption wrong. One evening I gave up, replaced everything with RevenueCat, and within hours had a far more robust solution. The built-in revenue graphs are also how I spotted the platform differences mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another tool I can recommend is AppFollow, which helps track App Store keywords. I’ve tried a few competitors and they’re all good, but AppFollow’s free tier does what I need right now. The paid tiers are aimed more at larger businesses than a solo developer quietly working away. Marketing is something I’ve had to learn along the way. I never expected anyone else to use the app, let alone see it used in courses, and selling myself doesn’t come naturally. I probably don’t do the app justice on that front yet, but AppFollow helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My final shout-out is RocketSim. It’s iOS-only, but it’s essentially the simulator tooling Xcode should have shipped with. Things like standardising the status bar for screenshots or quickly editing UserDefaults make everyday development far more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve already touched on pricing and the transition from free to paid, but it was the hardest decision I’ve made so far during development. Value Study originally had a free version with a paid upgrade, back when the feature set was much smaller. Over time, that felt like maintaining two apps with different bugs, and the free version was always the inferior experience. After a lot of advice from friends, I made the decision to make Value Study a paid app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even then, it wasn’t straightforward. I had existing free users, people who had already paid for lifetime access, and an app that needed ongoing work. Adding a paywall with both yearly and lifetime options felt like the least disruptive path forward. Everyone was given plenty of warning. For a while I considered making it subscription-only, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I believe in one-time purchases, especially for small, focused tools. When the change finally happened, I expected a backlash, but it never really came. I had quite a few personal messages of support, recognising that I had made a hard decision and many people wanted to congratulate me for it. One person even emailed to say the app should cost $25 a month. It doesn’t, but I did add a tip jar in Settings just in case!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s an awkward tension in making a useful learning tool. You want it to be accessible, but it also takes years of effort to build and maintain. As a solo developer, pricing isn’t a spreadsheet problem. It’s personal. Charge too much and it feels exclusionary, or greed. Charge too little and you risk devaluing the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t regret the decision. The app has done better financially than I expected, and most people seem happy with the low price and the two payment options. In an ideal world I’d be able to work on my own apps full time. Maybe that will happen one day. Until then, I’m grateful to have a side project that people clearly care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The money the app earns has allowed me to invest in it in ways that simply weren’t possible before. That mostly shows up in uninteresting but important places: better tooling, more real devices to test on, and more time spent fixing the small edge cases that only appear once an app is in real hands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of this is about greed. It’s about making sure that when someone does download Value Study, the app feels considered, reliable, and worth the small amount it asks in return. When people choose to pay for it, or take the time to leave a thoughtful review or email, it’s genuinely fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More recently, I’ve also started paying a small number of artists and content creators to talk about the app. I put this off for a long time because I was concerned it would be disingenuous. What’s mattered to me is that anyone I work with actually finds the app useful and honestly want to recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That brings me to the final twist in the journey so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While browsing the micro-influencer platform Collabstr, I came across Christian. He’s an incredible artist and content creator who makes tutorials with millions of followers across YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. I reached out, and he was immediately enthusiastic about the app and keen to make a video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The video was brilliant, and thanks to Instagram’s automatic translation, I understood every word which is impressive technology in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Christian is from Colombia and has a large Spanish-speaking audience. I knew this going in. The app had already been translated, and I thought it would be a great way to reach more Spanish-speaking users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In hindsight, what went wrong feels obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Christian demonstrated the app on his iPhone and iPad, where everything worked well. But I had underestimated just how Android-heavy usage would be. Very quickly, the low-star reviews started coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these were things I should have anticipated. Until then, most users were on iOS, so while Android mattered, it wasn’t my primary focus. That changed very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I was able to fix the major issues in a short space of time. Android is now in a much better place, and the app feels far closer to where it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking back, the journey has been far less linear than I expected. What started as a small personal tool has slowly become something other people rely on, in ways I couldn’t have predicted. Each step (and indeed misstep) has forced me to think more carefully about what I’m building and who I’m building it for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Value Study isn’t finished, and I hope it never really is. For now, it feels like it’s in a good place. It’s useful, it’s affordable, and it reflects the care that’s gone into it over the years. That’s enough to keep me going.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Feeling fancy? Add a &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt;attribute to the&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;tag via DevTools. It'll be saved in the URL too!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
