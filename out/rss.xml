Checksum verification passed - output matches original (from pf.conf)

$ pfjson -d -v tampered.json
Error decoding: Checksum verification failed - output does not match original metadata (from pf.conf)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Common error scenarios and their solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Invalid syntax in pf.conf
$ pfjson -c -e broken.conf
Error: Syntax error at line 5: unexpected token 'invalid'

# File doesn't exist
$ pfjson -e missing.conf

      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;dated&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;Q3 2025&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ink deformation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Freehand digital ink is an incredibly direct and fluid input method: It allows you to quickly jot down your ideas without any need for formalization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the main benefits of using digital ink over traditional pen &amp;amp; paper, is the ability change the properties of ink after you’ve drawn it, rather than needing to redraw from scratch. This ability also opens the door to end-user-programmability, as we can dynamically change properties based on computations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a number of different changes you might want to make such as changing the color or position of a drawing, which we understand pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, once you’ve drawn a stroke you might also want to change its shape. That is, to deform it. This could be relatively minor manual tweaks, such as resizing a box to make more space inside, or changing where an arrow points. It could also be more complex dynamically driven behaviour, such as a parametric sketchy CAD model, or perhaps bending a characters’ arm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Freehand v.s Formal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, if we were using a vector graphics tool, deforming shapes would be easy. Vector drawing tools provide a highly editable format that allows you to tweak positions exactly. Points, lines &amp;amp; bezier curves make a good match for computational dynamic behaviour, and we’ve explored end-user-programming with these primitives extensively in Crosscut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, for the most part, vector graphics lack the directness and fluidity of hand-drawn ink, instead requiring a lot of detailed and finicky manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can separate representations along two axis: the first is how neat a drawing is. A back-of-the-napkind sketch is less neat than an illustration in a textbook. The second, the extent to which it is computational or dynamic. A CAD model is more dynamic than a textbook. We’re looking for a solution in the top right quandrant. Informal, but dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there some way that we can maintain the directness and fluidity of hand-drawn ink, while adding the ability to manipulate shapes dynamically? Ideally, we’d do this by using formality on demand, allowing the user to add structure only when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that this is a crucial ingredient for programmable ink. But, it has so far proven tricky to get right. We want a model of freehand ink deformation that resolves this tension between freehand sketches and formal geometry. We want a system that allows the user to deform drawings both manually and programmatically, creating a smooth onramp between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a wide array of approaches to ink deformation, but, broadly speaking, we can break the problem down into three main steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding some kind of control structure; Something that the user can manipulate more readily than messy, hand-drawn ink strokes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding a mapping between the messy geometry and the simplified control structure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When deforming the control structure, use the mapping to deform the original geometry.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big open questions in relation to programmable ink are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to create the control structure, either automatically/manually.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to make the control structure match the underlying meaning of your sketch.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding a mapping between control structure and geometry. Either automatically in way that correctly maps to the conceptual model, or, manually in a way that doesn’t require a lot of complex actions, or, some hybrid approach that allows the user to tweak the mapping.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supporting a wide range of deformations from simple (formal) geometric shapes (lines, arcs, curves, rectangles etc), up to complex, higher level deformations like bending a character’s arm.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is an overview of the different techniques ` considered so far. There is overlap between the different categories, so don’t take the categories too strictly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Simplified geometry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest, and perhaps most “obvious” way to deform ink is to turn ink-strokes into simplified vector geometry. The resulting splines can then be deformed like you would do in a vector-drawing application; by manipulating handles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s significant overlap here with stroke simplification, and in fact, many vector drawing programs implement a ‘pencil’ tool that allows you to draw freely, and then manipulate the control points of the spline to deform the geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Algorithms for curve fitting are readily available though they aren’t necessarily trivial to get right. Producing a simplified stroke that looks good, does not mean that the resulting control points are useful for deformation. Figuring out the right number of control points requires heuristics and parameter tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly though, this approach really only works well for “clean” ink strokes, where the geometry is relatively simple and the number of resulting control points is low. In a sketchy environment, where the ink is messy and there is over-drawing, this approach can quickly become unwieldy. Because the mapping is per-stroke, it basically doesn’t work for higher level deformations like bending a character’s arm or twisting a shape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the Habitat project we explored a slightly more sophisticated approach which distinguishes between straight lines (with sharp corners) and curves. It also automatically joined separate strokes at the end-points. This more closely maps conceptual control points to drawn ink geometry.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One possible way to avoid stroke simplification entirely is to make a distinction between formal and informal ink Formal ink would effectively be what we consider to be vector graphics, while informal ink is purely freehand geometry.dy. Because the mapping is per-stroke, it basically doesn’t work for higher level deformations like bending a character’s arm or twisting a shape.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nudging, Pushing and Pulling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more direct way of deforming ink is to push and pull on it as if it were material, we’ve explored several approaches in this bucket. The main advantage of this approach is that it requires very little in the way of control structure (usually just the position of your finger).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;String: We’ve tried several times to explore the idea of deforming ink by treating ink strokes as a piece of string. By applying forces to the string (pushing &amp;amp; pulling) you can then deform ink strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Szymon explored the idea of using an IK-chain to deform ink strokes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ivan, similarly, explored a variant that feels more like a spider web.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nudging: A nudge tool typically works by applying a force to the geometry with a distance falloff from the cursor or touch point, which creates a smooth deformation effect. Nudging is useful for fixing small mistakes, but not really for large scale deformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Concepts app has a “Nudge” tool, which warps the ink by influencing the position of the ink. It’s also called “magnet tool”, or “falloff editing” in other software.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Early experiments by Szymon also explored nudging NURBS and b-splines&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noodlify: Finally, Marcel came up with the idea of noodlification which, rather than pulling on a single point, uses selection to pick up a whole chunk of ink. Any strokes that are sliced by the selection are then deformed by stretching them at the cutting point. This gives you much more control over which parts of the drawing stay stable, and which parts are deformed. Technically, this isn’t actually deforming strokes at all, as it’s just inserting new ink between to the stroke segments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Scale, stretch &amp;amp; warp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A very simple way to deform ink is to simply scale or stretch it along a single axis. This is perhaps the most straightforward and common way to deform shapes, though it has obvious limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many tools give you a bounding box that you can use to scale and stretch shapes. Some programs like Procreate even allow you to rotate the bounding box relative to the selection, which means you can stretch your drawing along any arbitrary axis (pretty neat).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Inkling prototype simply stretched ink along a single axis, which was surprisingly effective. Though this only really works in limited cases, and we considered it a temporary ‘cop-out’ rather than a final solution.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most advanced version of this, often called Warping, or Mesh Warp, is a technique that allows you to deform shapes in a flexible way. It involves creating some kind of “cage” around the drawing, in most cases a rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools like Procreate &amp;amp; Photoshop have a tool called “Mesh Warp”, which allows you to warp using a 3x3 grid.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 3D modeling tools this is also known as Lattice deformation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Skeletal deformation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skeletal deformation is the most common technique used in 2d and 3d graphics to deform shapes. It works by creating a skeleton using “bones”: simple geometry that is superimposed onto the actual geometry. Each point in the original geometry is then mapped to one-or-more bones, which are used to influence the position of the point. The bones can be moved and rotated, and the points in the geometry will deform accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically, the influence of each bone on a point is defined by a weight, which determines how much each bone affects a point. Each point is transformed by each bone’s matrix, scaled by the points’s weight for that bone. The final position is the sum of those weighted transformed positions. This is called linear-blend skinning. It is a very efficient technique that allows you to create complex deformations, and so it is common in games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, in-and-of-itself this does not give us a full deformation system, as we still need a way to define the bones and their weights. In most software this is done almost entirely manually, which is effectively a skilled job. A lot of the nuance comes from how the bones are structured (rigging), and how the weights are assigned, a process which is called weight painting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big challenge for us then, is finding an approach that allows us to surface these things without requiring complex UI or a lot of manual work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automatically generating bones (rigging), or automatically assigning weights (weight painting) are both active research areas, and there are plenty of published papers on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For automatic weights, a common set of techniques is called bone heat weighting, volumetric heat diffusion skinning, or harmonic coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Blender3d implements bone heat weighting as a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marcel implemented a variant of bone-heat weighting, which is what we’re currently using in Playbook. The heat diffusion step is relatively expensive, but is a massively paralelizable operation, which makes it suitable for GPU implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A different technique is described in Bounded Biharmonic Weights for Real-Time Deformation. This gives great, even somewhat physically plausible results, though it seems significantly more complex to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automatic rigging seems the more difficult problem, and seems to rely much more on heuristics and machine learning. Any known techniques are also less obviously applicable to our context, and the more useful results are to be found in Sketch simplification. Some papers that might be relevant here are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sketch simplification guided by complex agglomeration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Detecting Viewer-Perceived Intended Vector Sketch Connectivity&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Free-form deformation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A combination of skeletal deformation and mesh-warp, you can generalize your cage-shape to arbitrary closed polygons, which is sometimes called free-form deformation. There are many possible ways to compute mapping between geometry and cage, including: distance fields, barycentric coordinates, mean value coordinates, wachspress coordinates, green coordinates, harmonic coordinates. It’s relatively straight forward to do this for convex hulls, though it’s significantly more complex for concave geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Marcel explored some of this in the Etui study.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Physically accurate deformation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of different techniques that try to approximate physically accurate deformation of shapes, as if they were made of some sort of material. These techniques typically involve some kind of solver that computes the deformation based on the forces applied to the geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest way to implement this is as a mass-spring system, which is sometimes called Soft-body dynamics. The geometry is represented as a set of points connected by springs. When you apply a force, the solver computes how the points move based on the forces applied to them and the spring constants. This gives a squishy, bouncy effect which makes it popular in games and simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Marcel implemented a simple mass-spring deformation system.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, mass-spring systems are also very unstable, making them unsuitable for our purposes. Though there are techniques which improve stability such as shape matching. There are other approaches that are more stable, the most well known is described in As-rigid as possible deformation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools such as Photoshop implement ARAP and typically call it Puppet Warp.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can push this further to get more realistic physics using techniques such as Position Based Dyanamics. Some examples here, and here&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main drawback of all these techniques is that they require running a solver, making them very computationally expensive, which is not ideal in a real-time environment. Especially compared to the other forms of deformation which are increadibly cheap in comparison. Secondly, it’s not uncommon to want deformations that go beyond “physically accurate”, in which case a lot of these techniques are prone to numerical instability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Can we reveal objects that are hidden in environments completely opaque to the human eye? With conventional imaging techniques, the answer is no: a dense cloud or layer of material blocks light so completely that a simple photograph contains no information about what lies behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, a research collaboration between the Institut Langevin and TU Wien has now shown that, with the help of innovative mathematical tricks, objects can be detected even in such cases – using what is known as the ‘fingerprint matrix’. The team tested the newly developed method on metal objects buried in sand and in applications in the field of medical imaging. A joint publication on this topic has just appeared in the journal Nature Physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Seeing and hearing means wave scattering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether we take a normal photo or use ultrasound to look inside the body – from a physical point of view, the same thing always happens when we create an image: a wave is sent to an object, the object reflects part of the wave, and the reflected portion reaches our eye – or a measuring device. This reflected wave can be used to determine where the object is located.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this normally only works if the object's surroundings are sufficiently transparent. “Otherwise, for example in a dense cloud or in murky water, the phenomenon of multiple scattering occurs,” explains Prof. Stefan Rotter from the Institute of Theoretical Physics at TU Wien. The wave is scattered not only by the object to be imaged, but also by the surrounding environment – often many times over, so that only a greatly altered wave can be registered, in which the object being sought can no longer be recognised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Instead of the object, all you see is a diffuse fog – this is a fundamental problem of imaging techniques, from sonar in submarines to imaging techniques in medicine,” says Lukas Rachbauer, one of the co-authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;First the fingerprint, then the image&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To overcome this problem, the French-Austrian research team developed a novel method: first, a specific object is examined in an interference-free environment. Each object scatters waves in a very specific, characteristic way. This wave scattering fingerprint of the object can be described mathematically by a matrix – the so-called scattering matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The object is then hidden in a highly scattering medium – for example, buried in sand. “When ultrasonic waves are sent into this sand, they are scattered by the sand, but some of the sound penetrates so far into the sand that it is also scattered by the buried object,” says Stefan Rotter. “We cannot see the object, but the backscattered ultrasonic wave that hits the microphones of the measuring device still carries information about the fact that it has come into contact with the object we are looking for in the sand.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, on the one hand, you know the unaltered scattering matrix, the ‘fingerprint matrix’ of the object, and, on the other hand, you measure the wave scattering generated by the hidden object in a multiple-scattering medium, then you can calculate the position of the object using a mathematical method developed by the research team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“From the correlations between the measured reflected wave and the unaltered fingerprint matrix, it is possible to deduce where the object is most likely to be located, even if the object is buried,” explains Stefan Rotter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Steel balls in sand and medical markers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The method was tested with steel balls in sand, but also in medical applications: to monitor the recurrence of breast cancer, so-called lesion markers are used, which are often difficult to image because they are overlaid by scattered signals. With the new method, they were easy to locate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, fingerprint matrix technology was used to measure muscle fibres – which is particularly important for the diagnosis of heart and muscle diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The concept of the fingerprint matrix is very generally applicable – not only for ultrasound, but also for detection with light,” says Stefan Rotter. “It opens up important new possibilities in all areas of science where a reflection matrix can be measured.” Some objects also change their ‘scattering fingerprint’ when certain physical parameters change – such as pressure or temperature. Such variables could be measured from a distance using the new method. This would be particularly exciting, for example, in the measurement of the human brain, where waves have to penetrate the highly scattering skull.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In collaboration with CNRS Innovation and the Patent &amp;amp; Licence Management Department at TU Wien, the fingerprint method has now also been submitted for patenting and taken up by a medical technology company.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;NIRS fire destroys government's cloud storage system, no backups available&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Published: 01 Oct. 2025, 17:59 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fire at the National Information Resources Service (NIRS)'s Daejeon headquarters destroyed the government’s G-Drive cloud storage system, erasing work files saved individually by some 750,000 civil servants, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fire broke out in the server room on the fifth floor of the center, damaging 96 information systems designated as critical to central government operations, including the G-Drive platform. The G-Drive has been in use since 2018, requiring government officials to store all work documents in the cloud instead of on personal computers. It provided around 30 gigabytes of storage per person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, due to the system’s large-capacity, low-performance storage structure, no external backups were maintained — meaning all data has been permanently lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scale of damage varies by agency. The Ministry of Personnel Management, which had mandated that all documents be stored exclusively on G-Drive, was hit hardest. The Office for Government Policy Coordination, which used the platform less extensively, suffered comparatively less damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Personnel Ministry stated that all departments are expected to experience work disruptions. It is currently working to recover alternative data using any files saved locally on personal computers within the past month, along with emails, official documents and printed records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Interior Ministry noted that official documents created through formal reporting or approval processes were also stored in the government’s Onnara system and may be recoverable once that system is restored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Final reports and official records submitted to the government are also stored in OnNara, so this is not a total loss,” said a director of public services at the Interior Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Interior Ministry explained that while most systems at the Daejeon data center are backed up daily to separate equipment within the same center and to a physically remote backup facility, the G-Drive’s structure did not allow for external backups. This vulnerability ultimately left it unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Criticism continues to build regarding the government's data management protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Author practices jumping rope with seaweed while work awaits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;``. . . anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn't the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment." -- Robert Benchley, in Chips off the Old Benchley, 1949&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been intending to write this essay for months. Why am I finally doing it? Because I finally found some uncommitted time? Wrong. I have papers to grade, textbook orders to fill out, an NSF proposal to referee, dissertation drafts to read. I am working on this essay as a way of not doing all of those things. This is the essence of what I call structured procrastination, an amazing strategy I have discovered that converts procrastinators into effective human beings, respected and admired for all that they can accomplish and the good use they make of time. All procrastinators put off things they have to do. Structured procrastination is the art of making this bad trait work for you. The key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing. Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing; they do marginally useful things, like gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they get around to it. Why does the procrastinator do these things? Because they are a way of not doing something more important. If all the procrastinator had left to do was to sharpen some pencils, no force on earth could get him do it. However, the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structured procrastination means shaping the structure of the tasks one has to do in a way that exploits this fact. The list of tasks one has in mind will be ordered by importance. Tasks that seem most urgent and important are on top. But there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower down on the list. Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher up on the list. With this sort of appropriate task structure, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen. Indeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most perfect situation for structured procrastination that I ever had was when my wife and I served as Resident Fellows in Soto House, a Stanford dormitory. In the evening, faced with papers to grade, lectures to prepare, committee work to be done, I would leave our cottage next to the dorm and go over to the lounge and play ping-pong with the residents, or talk over things with them in their rooms, or just sit there and read the paper. I got a reputation for being a terrific Resident Fellow, and one of the rare profs on campus who spent time with undergraduates and got to know them. What a set up: play ping pong as a way of not doing more important things, and get a reputation as Mr. Chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this goes contrary to the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be by definition the most important, and the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is a way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point you may be asking, "How about the important tasks at the top of the list, that one never does?" Admittedly, there is a potential problem here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trick is to pick the right sorts of projects for the top of the list. The ideal sorts of things have two characteristics, First, they seem to have clear deadlines (but really don't). Second, they seem awfully important (but really aren't). Luckily, life abounds with such tasks. In universities the vast majority of tasks fall into this category, and I'm sure the same is true for most other large institutions. Take for example the item right at the top of my list right now. This is finishing an essay for a volume in the philosophy of language. It was supposed to be done eleven months ago. I have accomplished an enormous number of important things as a way of not working on it. A couple of months ago, bothered by guilt, I wrote a letter to the editor saying how sorry I was to be so late and expressing my good intentions to get to work. Writing the letter was, of course, a way of not working on the article. It turned out that I really wasn't much further behind schedule than anyone else. And how important is this article anyway? Not so important that at some point something that seems more important won't come along. Then I'll get to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another example is book order forms. I write this in June. In October, I will teach a class on Epistemology. The book order forms are already overdue at the book store. It is easy to take this as an important task with a pressing deadline (for you non-procrastinators, I will observe that deadlines really start to press a week or two after they pass.) I get almost daily reminders from the department secretary, students sometimes ask me what we will be reading, and the unfilled order form sits right in the middle of my desk, right under the wrapping from the sandwich I ate last Wednesday. This task is near the top of my list; it bothers me, and motivates me to do other useful but superficially less important things. But in fact, the book store is plenty busy with forms already filed by non-procrastinators. I can get mine in mid-Summer and things will be fine. I just need to order popular well-known books from efficient publishers. I will accept some other, apparently more important, task sometime between now and, say, August 1st. Then my psyche will feel comfortable about filling out the order forms as a way of not doing this new task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The observant reader may feel at this point that structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self-deception, since one is in effect constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself. Exactly. One needs to be able to recognize and commit oneself to tasks with inflated importance and unreal deadlines, while making oneself feel that they are important and urgent. This is not a problem, because virtually all procrastinators have excellent self-deceptive skills also. And what could be more noble than using one character flaw to offset the bad effects of another?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Build your dreams&lt;lb/&gt;on AWS, effortlessly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flightcontrol is a PaaS that deploys to your AWS account&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Servers, Lambdas, workers, crons, static sites, databases &amp;amp; Redis&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We are your devops team with 24/7 emergency support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Companies outgrowing other PaaS or homegrown AWS switch to Flightcontrol to regain reliability, security, and scalability at a reasonable cost&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Over $1 million of AWS resources under management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The old way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our AWS setup is consuming too much time &amp;amp; attention"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your team gets bogged down with complex Terraform scripts, manual configuration, and endless CI/CD pipelines. You could hire DevOps engineers, but they are expensive and it's hard to find really good ones. It will do the job, but now your developer productivity suffers as they are dependent on the infra team to make changes or spin up new services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The new way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Flightcontrol gives our team the power to manage bare metal AWS without needing to hire specific talent"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Save thousands of dollars and months of time because Flightcontrol significantly reduces DevOps overhead. It empowers your developers ship like crazy without needing AWS or infrastructure expertise. Your developers gain full autonomy while benefiting from AWS's unmatched scalability, reliability, and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Simple, powerful deployments without worrying about low level AWS config&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We take the best AWS services, put together a best-in-class setup, and make them super easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Connect your AWS account to Flightcontrol&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Connect your git repository to Flightcontrol&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Define your services (servers, APIs, databases, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Flightcontrol fully automates infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD, and deployments. All within your own AWS account where you retain full visibility and control&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flightcontrol simplifies your deployments by providing a user-friendly dashboard designed specifically for developers, not DevOps engineers. Forget the frustration of navigating AWS’s overwhelming and fragmented console. With Flightcontrol, you see your entire infrastructure clearly in one intuitive interface, allowing you to manage deployments, services, and scaling with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deployments become as easy as a simple git push or webhook integration. Flightcontrol handles your CI/CD automation entirely, enabling your team to deploy confidently and quickly without maintaining complex Terraform or CDK scripts. You get the simplicity of platforms like Vercel or Heroku, paired with the raw power, near perfect reliability, and immense flexibility of AWS. Your developers can ship faster and stay focused on building great products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Serve all your use-cases from a single platform&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern computers use memory modules (DRAM) to store everything in use: from photos and passwords to credit card numbers. Public cloud providers increasingly deploy hardware-level memory encryption to protect this sensitive data. However, we previously showed that malicious memory modules, nicknamed “Bad RAM”, can bypass these protections by deliberately supplying false metadata during processor boot. In response, modern cloud systems now validate memory more strictly at startup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Breaking Memory Encryption with Two-Faced DRAM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battering RAM fully breaks cutting-edge Intel SGX and AMD SEV-SNP confidential computing processor security technologies designed to protect sensitive workloads from compromised hosts, malicious cloud providers, or rogue employees. Our stealthy interposer bypasses both memory encryption and state-of-the-art boot-time defenses, invisible to the operating system. It enables arbitrary plaintext access to SGX-protected memory, and breaks SEV’s attestation feature on fully patched systems. Ultimately, Battering RAM exposes the limits of today’s scalable memory encryption. Intel and AMD have acknowledged our findings, but defending against Battering RAM would require a fundamental redesign of memory encryption itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Building Battering RAM on a $50 Budget&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike commercial passive interposers, which are exceedingly expensive and commonly cost over $100,000, we developed a custom-built interposer that uses simple analog switches to actively manipulate signals between the processor and memory, and can be built for less than $50.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All schematics and board files for our custom interposer are available as open source in our GitHub repository. The PCB is a standard 4-layer design and can be fabricated at any major PCB fabricator such as JLCPCB, PCBWay, or Eurocircuits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Battering RAM in Action&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Questions and Answers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battering RAM can affect all systems using DDR4 memory, but is especially relevant for "confidential computing" workloads running in public cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern Intel and AMD x86 cloud processors feature built-in access control and memory encryption to keep private data safe, even from the company running the cloud. However, our research shows that these guarantees can be bypassed with a low-cost memory interposer, allowing a rogue cloud infrastructure provider or insider with limited physical access to compromise protected workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confidential computing aims to protect private data even from the cloud provider, using hardware-level access control and memory encryption. Even if someone accesses the memory, they should only see encrypted (garbled) data. Battering RAM uses a low-cost, custom-built memory interposer installed between the processor and memory to tamper with such encrypted memory. It requires only brief one-time physical access, which is realistic in cloud environments, considering, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rogue cloud employees;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Datacenter technicians or cleaning personnel;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coercive local law enforcement agencies;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supply chain tampering during shipping or manufacturing of the memory modules.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel SGX and AMD SEV-SNP are two leading hardware-based trusted execution environments that enable secure cloud computations without needing to trust the cloud provider. They do this by enforcing strict access control and encrypting memory so that even if someone accesses it, they only see unreadable data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD SEV and Intel SGX are widely offered by major cloud providers like like Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and IBM cloud. They also power privacy features in real-world applications like Signal, WhatsApp, and Chrome, and are used in sectors like healthcare to protect sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. While Intel Scalable SGX and AMD SEV-SNP use memory encryption to protect data stored in DRAM, this encryption is static: the same plaintext at the same physical address always maps to the same ciphertext. This defends against passive attacks, such as cold boot attacks, but not against Battering RAM, which can actively corrupt or replay memory contents. Because the encryption is static, replayed data decrypts to the original value, allowing stale data to be reused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Intel's memory encryption engine for DDR4 systems, TME, relies on a single key for the entire memory range. This means encryption is static, not only per address, but also shared across both attacker and victim. By replaying and capturing ciphertexts from attacker-controlled pages, the attacker can recover and inject arbitrary plaintext within the victim’s memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hence, Battering RAM exposes the fundamental limits of the scalable memory encryption designs currently used by Intel and AMD, which omit cryptographic freshness checks in favor of larger protected memory sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BadRAM similarly exploited physical address aliasing to modify and replay encrypted memory on AMD SEV-SNP systems. However, BadRAM relied on modifying the SPD chip on the DIMM to report a false memory size at boot time, introducing static ghost address lines. In response, Intel and AMD added boot-time checks to detect and block such static aliases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battering RAM, on the other hand, is capable of introducing memory aliases dynamically at runtime. As a result, Battering RAM can circumvent Intel's and AMD's boot-time alias checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concurrent to our work on Battering RAM, an independent research team developed the WireTap attack, which uses a commercial DDR4 DRAM interposer to break Intel Scalable SGX. Both Battering RAM and WireTap stem from a similar attack vector, but the approaches and findings are distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key differences between these two attacks are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cost: commercial DRAM interposers require specialized, high-speed signal analyzers (typically retailing at &amp;gt;$150,000), whereas our custom-built interposer requires only two simple analog switches and some control logic, totalling about $50. Battering RAM, therefore, shows that physical attacks are practical and not limited to resourceful adversaries with a large budget.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technique: Battering RAM and WireTap exploit distinct techniques: memory aliasing vs. ciphertext side-channel analysis. Commercial DRAM interposers passively capture memory traffic, requiring additional ciphertext side-channel inference to recover secrets. In contrast, Battering RAM uses a custom-built interposer that actively redirects address lines to introduce aliases, allowing not just observation but also replay and corruption of ciphertext and culminating in plaintext read/write access on Scalable SGX.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Target: Both Battering RAM and WireTap expose the security limitations of current, scalable memory encryption technologies. Battering RAM breaks remote attestation for both Intel Scalable SGX and AMD SEV-SNP, whereas WireTap was only demonstrated on Intel Scalable SGX but may affect AMD DDR4 systems similarly.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found that our interposer can compromise the security of two widely-deployed TEEs, Intel Scalable SGX and AMD SEV-SNP. Both of these technologies employ a memory encryption scheme that is vulnerable to memory replay attacks. Furthermore, Scalable SGX on DDR4 platforms only employs a single memory encryption key for the entire physical memory space. We show this limitation can be exploited to create an arbitrary plaintext primitive. This severely undermines the protections in the presence of a physical adversary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that, our interposer re-enables the previously-mitigated BadRAM attacks. To combat this threat, AMD rolled out firmware-level mitigations that scan for aliases at boot time. As the interposer can enable and disable the interposer at runtime, these checks are easily bypassed. As a result, Battering RAM re-enables previous attacks on AMD SEV-SNP and Intel Client SGX .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm has also announced a cloud TEE called CCA . Based on the specification, DDR4 systems may also be vulnerable to Battering RAM. However, as no hardware is available yet, we were unable to test our interposer on CCA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes our findings across different TEEs. Each column indicates whether we were able to read, write, or replay ciphertexts, and read/write plaintext in protected memory regions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;TEE&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Read&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Write&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Replay&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Plaintext&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Intel Scalable SGX&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;AMD SEV-SNP&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Client SGX&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Intel TDX&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Arm CCA&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, our interposer only works on DDR4, which remains widely deployed today; e.g., a recent market study indicates that DDR4 still accounted for around 65% of sold DRAM modules in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DDR5 reorganizes the command/address bus, which removes the possibility of adding simple switches to the address lines. However, the underlying issue is not fixed, as current memory encryption engines still do not provide freshness guarantees. A determined attacker could theoretically still design more advanced interposers to perform similar attacks on DDR5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, our GitHub repository contains the hardware schematics and board files for the custom DDR4 interposer, firmware for the microcontroller, and proof-of-concept code for all attacks described in our paper. The interposer can be built for under $50, and the bill of materials is listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We disclosed our findings to both Intel and AMD in February 2025. Both vendors have acknowledged our findings, but noted that physical attacks on DRAM are out of scope for their current products. To better reflect this position, Intel deposited the whitepaper on Scalable SGX, previously removed from the Intel website, permanently on arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following an embargo period until September 30, 2025, both vendors have issued a public security advisory: Intel advisory | AMD advisory&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Confidential computing is here, but is not invincible. &lt;p&gt;Despite strong adoption by major CPU vendors and cloud providers, current technologies have critical physical-layer limitations that remain underexamined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Reevaluate your threat models. &lt;p&gt;Encrypted memory is not inherently secure against physical tampering, and firmware-based mitigations alone are insufficient in threat scenarios involving limited physical access, such as malicious insiders or supply-chain compromises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Advanced physical attacks are accessible at low cost. &lt;p&gt;Our open-source $50 custom device costs only a fraction of commercial DRAM interposers (upwards of $100,000) and is capable of breaking multi-million-dollar cloud security technologies from Intel and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet has decided to award the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mary E. Brunkow&lt;lb/&gt;Institute for Systems Biology,&lt;lb/&gt;Seattle, USA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fred Ramsdell&lt;lb/&gt;Sonoma Biotherapeutics,&lt;lb/&gt;San Francisco, USA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shimon Sakaguchi&lt;lb/&gt;Osaka University,&lt;lb/&gt;Osaka, Japan&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;They discovered how the immune system is kept in check&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The body’s powerful immune system must be regulated, or it may attack our own organs. Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi are awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 for their groundbreaking discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance that prevents the immune system from harming the body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every day, our immune system protects us from thousands of different microbes trying to invade our bodies. These all have different appearances, and many have developed similarities with human cells as a form of camouflage. So how does the immune system determine what it should attack and what it should defend?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi are awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 for their fundamental discoveries relating to peripheral immune tolerance. The laureates identified the immune system’s security guards, regulatory T cells, which prevent immune cells from attacking our own body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,” says Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shimon Sakaguchi was swimming against the tide in 1995, when he made the first key discovery. At the time, many researchers were convinced that immune tolerance only developed due to potentially harmful immune cells being eliminated in the thymus, through a process called central tolerance. Sakaguchi showed that the immune system is more complex and discovered a previously unknown class of immune cells, which protect the body from autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell made the other key discovery in 2001, when they presented the explanation for why a specific mouse strain was particularly vulnerable to autoimmune diseases. They had discovered that the mice have a mutation in a gene that they named Foxp3. They also showed that mutations in the human equivalent of this gene cause a serious autoimmune disease, IPEX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years after this, Shimon Sakaguchi was able to link these discoveries. He proved that the Foxp3 gene governs the development of the cells he identified in 1995. These cells, now known as regulatory T cells, monitor other immune cells and ensure that our immune system tolerates our own tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The laureates’ discoveries launched the field of peripheral tolerance, spurring the development of medical treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. This may also lead to more successful transplantations. Several of these treatments are now undergoing clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Modern messaging: Running your own XMPP server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since a years we know, or might suspect, our chats are listend on, our uploaded files are sold for advertising or what purpose ever and the chance our social messengers leak our private data is incredibly high. It is about time to work against this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 3 years the European Commission works on a plan to automatically monitor all chat, email and messenger conversations.12 If this is going to pass, and I strongly hope it will not, the European Union is moving into a direction we know from states suppressing freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went for setting up my own XMPP server, as this does not have any big resource requirements and still support clustering (for high-availabilty purposes), encryption via OMEMO, file sharing and has support for platforms and operating systems. Also the ecosystem with clients and multiple use cases evolved over the years to provide rock-solid software and solutions for multi-user chats or event audio and video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All steps and settings are bundled in a repository containing Ansible roles: https://codeberg.org/codedge/chat&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All code snippets written below work in either Debian os Raspberry Pi OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setting up your own XMPP server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The connection from your client to the XMPP server is encrypted and we need certificates for our server. First thing to do is setting up our domains and point it to the IP - both IPv4 and IPv6 is supported and we can specify both later in our configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I assume the server is going to be run under &lt;code&gt;xmpp.example.com&lt;/code&gt; and you all the following domains have been set up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Type&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Name&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Notes&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;xmpp.example.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;your main xmpp server address&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;conference.xmpp.example.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;needed for MUC (Multi User Chat)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;proxy.xmpp.example.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;needed for SOCKS5 proxy support&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;pubsub.xmpp.example.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;needed for publish/subscribe support&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;upload.xmpp.example.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;needed for file uploads&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;stun.xmpp.example.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;needed for audio&amp;amp;video calling&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;turn.xmpp.example.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;needed for audio&amp;amp;video calling&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fill in the IPv6 addresses accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ejabberd is a robust server software, that is included in most Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install from Process One repository&lt;lb/&gt;I discovered ProcessOne, the company behind ejabberd, also provides a Debian repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install from Github&lt;lb/&gt;To get the most recent one, I use the packages offered in their code repository. Installing version 25.07 just download the asset from the release:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure the fowolling ports are opened in your firewall, taken from ejabberd firewall settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5222: Jabber/XMPP client connections, plain or STARTTLS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5223: Jabber client connections, using the old SSL method&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5269: Jabber/XMPP incoming server connections&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5280/5443: HTTP/HTTPS for Web Admin and many more&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;7777: SOCKS5 file transfer proxy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3478/5349: STUN+TURN/STUNS+TURNS service&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Port &lt;code&gt;1883&lt;/code&gt;, used for MQTT, is also mentioned in the ejabberd docs, but we do not use this in our setup. So this port stays closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depending how you installed ejabberd the config file is either at &lt;code&gt;/etc/ejabberd/conf/ejabberd.yml&lt;/code&gt;
or &lt;code&gt;/opt/ejabberd/conf/ejabberd.yml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;General configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The configuration is a balance of 70:30 between having a privacy-focused setup for your users and meeting most of the suggestions of the XMPP complicance test. That means, settings that protect the provacy of the users are higher rated despite not passing the test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore notable privacy and security settings are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;XMPP over HTTP is disabled (mod_bosh)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discover then a user last accessed a server is disabled (mod_last)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Delete uploaded files on a regular base (see upload config)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Register account via a web page is disabled (mod_register_web)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In-band registration can be enabled, default off, captcha secured (mod_register, see registration config)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The configuration file is in YAML format. Keep an eye for indentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start digging into the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set the domain of your server&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set the database type&lt;lb/&gt;Instead of using the default &lt;code&gt;mnesia&lt;/code&gt; type, we opt for &lt;code&gt;sql&lt;/code&gt;, better said &lt;code&gt;sqlite&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generate DH params&lt;lb/&gt;Generate a fresh set of params for the DH key exchange. In your terminal run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and link the new file in the ejabberd configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure TLS for server-to-server connections&lt;lb/&gt;Use TLS for server-to-server (s2s) connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The listners&lt;lb/&gt;The listeners aka &lt;code&gt;request_handlers&lt;/code&gt; inside the config especially for &lt;code&gt;/admin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/captcha&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/upload&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/ws&lt;/code&gt; are important.
All of them listen on port &lt;code&gt;5443&lt;/code&gt;. Only one request handler is attached to port &lt;code&gt;5280&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;/.well-known/acme-challenge&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ACLs &amp;amp; Access rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For adminstration of ejabberd we need a user with admin rights and properly set up ACLs and access rules. There is a separat section for ACLs inside the config in which we set up an admin user name &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;. The name of the user
is important for later, when we actually create this user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;access_rules&lt;/code&gt; should already be set up, just to confirm that you have a correct entry for the &lt;code&gt;configure&lt;/code&gt; action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the new &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; user needs to be create by running this command on the console.
Watch out to put in the correct domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another user can be registered with the same command.&lt;lb/&gt;We set &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; as the admin user in the config previously. That is how ejabberd knows which user has admin permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enable file uploads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enabling file uploads is done with &lt;code&gt;mod_http_upload&lt;/code&gt;.
First, create a folder where the uploads should be stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now update the ejabberd configuration like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allowed file upload size is defined in the &lt;code&gt;max_size&lt;/code&gt; param and is set to 10MB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure, to delete uploaded files in a reasonable amount of time via cronjob. This is an example of a cronjob, that deletes files that are older than 1 week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Registration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Registration in ejabberd is done via &lt;code&gt;mod_register&lt;/code&gt;
and can be enabled with these entries in the config file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to enable registration for your server make sure you enable a captcha for it. Otherwise you will get a lot of spam and fake registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ejabberd provides a working captcha script, that you can copy to your server and link in your configuration. You will need &lt;code&gt;imaggemagick&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gstools&lt;/code&gt; installed
on you system. In the &lt;code&gt;ejabberd.yml&lt;/code&gt; config file&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Add TLS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ejabberd can provision TLS certificates on its own. No need to install certbot. To not expose ejabberd directly to the internet, &lt;code&gt;nginx&lt;/code&gt; is put in front of the XMPP server. Instead of using nginx, every other web server (caddy, &amp;amp;mldr;)
or proxy can be used as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a sample config for nginx:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Alternative connection methods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The nginx vhosts offers files, &lt;code&gt;host-meta&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;host-meta.json&lt;/code&gt;, for indicating which other connection methods (BOSH, WS) your server offers. The details can be read in XEP-0156 extension.
Opposite to the examples in the XEP, there is no BOSH, but only a websocket connection our server offers. The BOSH part is removed from the config file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;host-meta&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;host-meta.json&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put that file in a folder your nginx serves. Have a look at the path and URL it is expected to be, see &lt;code&gt;.well-known&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Choose your client&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clients I can recommend are Profanity, an easy to use command-line client, and Monal for MacOS and iOS. A good overview of client can be found on the offical XMPP website.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - AMD (AMD.O) will supply artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI in a multi-year deal that would bring in tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue and give the ChatGPT creator the option to buy up to roughly 10% of the chipmaker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shares of the chipmaker surged more than 34% on Monday, putting them on track for their biggest one-day gain in over nine years and adding roughly $80 billion to the company's market value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deal, latest in a string of investment commitments, underscores OpenAI and the broader AI industry's voracious appetite for computing power as companies race toward developing AI technology that meets or exceeds human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry," AMD executive vice president Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;VOTE OF CONFIDENCE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agreement closely ties the startup at the center of the AI boom to AMD, one of the strongest rivals of Nvidia (NVDA.O), which recently agreed to make substantial investments in OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analysts said it was a major vote of confidence in AMD's AI chips and software but is unlikely to dent Nvidia's dominance, as the market leader continues to sell every AI chip it can make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It covers the deployment of hundreds of thousands of AMD's AI chips, or graphics processing units (GPUs), equivalent to six gigawatts, over several years beginning in the second half of 2026. This is roughly equivalent to the energy needs of 5 million U.S. households, or about thrice the amount of power produced by the Hoover Dam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD said OpenAI would build a one-gigawatt facility based on its forthcoming MI450 series of chips beginning next year, and that it would begin to recognize revenue then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD executives expect the deal to net tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. Because of the ripple effect of the agreement, AMD expects to receive more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of $32.78 billion this year, according to LSEG data. In contrast, analysts are expecting Nvidia to report revenue of $206.26 billion for the current fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"AMD has really trailed Nvidia for quite some time. So I think it helps validate their technology," said Leah Bennett, chief investment strategist at Concurrent Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shares of Nvidia dipped more than 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the AMD deal will help his startup build enough AI infrastructure to meet its needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the massive deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI, which is valued at $500 billion, generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025 and burned through $2.5 billion in cash, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DEAL DETAILS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chip deal. The warrant vests in tranches based on milestones that the two companies have agreed on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first tranche will vest after the initial shipment of MI450 chips set for the second half of 2026. The remaining milestones include specific AMD stock price targets that escalate to $600 a share for the final installment of stock to unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September, Nvidia announced a deal to supply OpenAI with at least 10 gigawatts worth of its systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast with the startup's deal with AMD where it will take a stake in the chipmaker, Nvidia will invest $100 billion in the ChatGPT parent under the terms of the agreement announced in September.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking a stake in AMD could give OpenAI "the power to potentially influence corporate strategy. With Nvidia, OpenAI is simply the client and not a part-owner," said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at A.J. Bell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OPENAI WANTS MORE GPUs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI has worked with AMD for years, providing inputs on the design of older generations of AI chips such as the MI300X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based AI company has been taking a number of steps to ensure it has the chips needed for its future needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Altman has floated expectations of reaching 250 gigawatts of compute in total by 2033, The Information has reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI's deal last month with Nvidia includes the deployment of one gigawatt of the chip giant's next-generation Vera Rubin processors in late 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is also in the process of developing its own silicon for AI use and has partnered with Broadcom (AVGO.O), Reuters reported last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The startup and its main backer, Microsoft (MSFT.O), announced last month that they had signed a non-binding agreement to restructure OpenAI into a for-profit entity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the matter said the deal with AMD does not change any of OpenAI's ongoing compute plans, including that effort or its partnership with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Monorepo Tasks #6564&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We're excited to announce Monorepo Tasks, a powerful new feature that brings first-class monorepo support to mise tasks! 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;What is it?&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Monorepo Tasks allows you to manage tasks across multiple projects in a single repository, with each project maintaining its own tools, environment variables, and tasks. Think of it as bringing the power of tools like Bazel or Turborepo to mise's task system, but with mise's signature simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Key Features&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;🎯 Unified Task Namespace&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;All tasks across your monorepo are automatically discovered and prefixed with their location:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;mise //projects/frontend:build
mise //projects/backend:test
mise //services/api:deploy&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;🌳 Smart Tool &amp;amp; Environment Inheritance&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Define common tools at the root, override them where needed:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;# Root mise.toml
[tools]
node = "20"      # Inherited everywhere
python = "3.12"

# projects/legacy-app/mise.toml
[tools]
node = "14"      # Override just for this project
# python still inherited!&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;🎭 Powerful Wildcard Patterns&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Run tasks across multiple projects with ease:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;# Run tests in ALL projects
mise //...:test

# Run all build tasks under services/
mise //services/...:build

# Run ALL tasks in frontend (wildcards need quotes)
mise '//projects/frontend:*'

# Run all test:* tasks everywhere
mise '//...:test:*'&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;✨ Consistent Execution Anywhere&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Run tasks from anywhere in the monorepo - they always execute with the correct context, tools, and environment from their config_root.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;🔒 Automatic Trust Propagation&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trust your monorepo root once, and all descendant configs are automatically trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Quick Start&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1. Enable the feature in your root &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;experimental_monorepo_root = true

[tools]
node = "20"
python = "3.12"&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2. Set the experimental flag:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;export MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3. Add tasks to your projects:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;# projects/frontend/mise.toml
[tasks.build]
run = "npm run build"

[tasks.test]
run = "npm test"&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4. Run tasks from anywhere:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;mise //projects/frontend:build
mise //...:test  # Run tests in all projects!&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Example Monorepo Structure&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Run all service builds: &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Managing monorepos is hard. Coordinating tools, tasks, and environments across dozens of projects is even harder. With Monorepo Tasks, you get:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;How Does This Compare to Other Tools?&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The monorepo ecosystem is rich with excellent tools, each with different strengths. Here's how mise's Monorepo Tasks compares:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Simple Task Runners&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Taskfile and Just are fantastic for single-project task automation. They're lightweight and easy to set up, but they weren't designed with monorepos in mind. While you can have multiple Taskfiles/Justfiles in a repo, they don't provide unified task discovery, cross-project wildcards, or automatic tool/environment inheritance across projects.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;mise's advantage: Automatic task discovery across the entire monorepo with a unified namespace and powerful wildcard patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;JavaScript-Focused Tools&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Nx, Turborepo, and Lerna are powerful tools specifically designed for JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;mise's advantage: Language-agnostic support. While these tools excel in JS/TS ecosystems, mise works equally well with Rust, Go, Python, Ruby, or any mix of languages. You also get unified tool version management (not just tasks) and environment variables across your entire stack.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Large-Scale Build Systems&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Bazel (Google) and Buck2 (Meta) are industrial-strength build systems designed for massive, multi-language monorepos at companies with thousands of engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Both are extremely powerful but come with significant complexity:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;mise's advantage: Simplicity through non-hermetic builds. mise doesn't try to control your entire build environment in isolation - instead, it manages tools and tasks in a flexible, practical way. This "non-hermetic" approach means you can use mise without restructuring your entire codebase or learning a new language. You get powerful monorepo task management with simple TOML configuration - enough power for most teams without the enterprise-level complexity that hermetic builds require.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Other Notable Tools&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Rush (Microsoft) offers strict dependency management and build orchestration for JavaScript monorepos, with a focus on safety and convention adherence.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Moon is a newer Rust-based build system that aims to be developer-friendly while supporting multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;The mise Sweet Spot&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;mise's Monorepo Tasks aims to hit the sweet spot between simplicity and power:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When to choose mise:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When to consider alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The best tool is the one that fits your team's needs. mise's Monorepo Tasks is designed for teams who want powerful monorepo management without the complexity overhead, especially when working across multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What if ChatGPT was aware of my company's context?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We've all wondered it at some point.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What if AI already understood your companyâso you could skip the busywork, the repetitive asks, the frustration?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It could take care of the many chores that exist in work today, making our days a little less annoying and little more fun.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Other products we've tried haven't quite worked. Some of us have tried to build it ourselves.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;That's why we built Grapevine. And it finally works.&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The basic situation is that if OpenAI announces a big partnership with a public company, that company’s stock will go up. Today OpenAI announced a deal to buy tens of billions of dollars of chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and AMD’s stock went up. As of noon today, AMD’s stock was at $213 per share, up about 29% from Friday’s close; it had added about $78 billion of market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nearly half of drivers killed in crashes had THC in their blood&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;THC-impaired driving deaths are soaring, and legalization hasn’t slowed the trend.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;

      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;October 5, 2025&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Source:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;American College of Surgeons&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Summary:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;Over 40% of fatal crash victims had THC levels far above legal limits, showing cannabis use before driving remains widespread. The rate didn’t drop after legalization, suggesting policy changes haven’t altered risky habits. Experts warn that the lack of public awareness around marijuana’s dangers behind the wheel is putting lives at risk.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Share:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In a review of 246 deceased drivers, 41.9% tested positive for active THC in their blood, with an average level of 30.7 ng/mL -- far exceeding most state impairment limits.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The high rate of THC positivity remained consistent over six years and was unaffected by the state's legalization of recreational cannabis during the study period.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Messaging around the dangers of smoking cannabis and driving needs to be stronger, authors argue.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New study findings show that over 40% of drivers who died in motor vehicle collisions tested positive for active delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their system, with average blood levels far exceeding those considered to cause impairment. The research highlights a significant and persistent public health risk that is unchanged by the legalization of recreational cannabis, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research will be presented at the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Clinical Congress 2025 in Chicago, October 4-7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed coroner records from Montgomery County in Ohio from January 2019 to September 2024, focusing on 246 deceased drivers who were tested for THC following a fatal crash. When autopsies are performed, drug screening is typically part of the process. The study period included the state's legalization of recreational cannabis in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I was surprised to see that level," said lead author Akpofure P. Ekeh, MBBS, FACS, a professor of surgery at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. "An average level of 30.7 ng/mL generally means those people must have consumed marijuana at some time close to driving. This isn't about residual use; it's about recent consumption."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Study Findings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High Prevalence: 103 drivers (41.9%) overall tested positive for THC, with yearly rates ranging from 25.7% to 48.9%.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No Effect from Legalization: The rate of drivers who tested positive for THC did not change significantly before or after legalization (42.1% vs. 45.2%), indicating that legal status did not influence the behavior of those who chose to drive after use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consistent Over Time: The high rate of THC positivity showed no significant change over the six-year study period.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study notes that blood THC levels are typically drawn by the coroner within hours of death, providing an accurate snapshot of a driver's state at the time of the crash. Most states that have set legal limits for driving range from 2 to 5 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) -- a threshold the average level in this study (30.7 ng/mL) far exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The messaging over the last few years has been just the push towards recreational legalization," Dr. Ekeh noted. "The problem is that from a public health standpoint, there has not been enough emphasis on some of the downsides and the dangers that can occur. People should treat smoking marijuana just like they treat alcohol: don't smoke and drive."&lt;/p&gt;
