  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I hacked together a weekend project. What started as “WhatsApp Relay” now has over 100,000 GitHub stars and drew 2 million visitors in a single week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I’m excited to announce our new name: OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Naming Journey&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve been through some names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clawd was born in November 2025—a playful pun on “Claude” with a claw. It felt perfect until Anthropic’s legal team politely asked us to reconsider. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moltbot came next, chosen in a chaotic 5am Discord brainstorm with the community. Molting represents growth - lobsters shed their shells to become something bigger. It was meaningful, but it never quite rolled off the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is where we land. And this time, we did our homework: trademark searches came back clear, domains have been purchased, migration code has been written. The name captures what this project has become:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open: Open source, open to everyone, community-driven&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claw: Our lobster heritage, a nod to where we came from&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What OpenClaw Is&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is an open agent platform that runs on your machine and works from the chat apps you already use. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams—wherever you are, your AI assistant follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike SaaS assistants where your data lives on someone else’s servers, OpenClaw runs where you choose—laptop, homelab, or VPS. Your infrastructure. Your keys. Your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s New in This Release&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with the rebrand, we’re shipping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New Channels: Twitch and Google Chat plugins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Models: Support for KIMI K2.5 &amp;amp; Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web Chat: Send images just like you can in messaging apps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: 34 security-related commits to harden the codebase&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank all security folks for their hard work in helping us harden the project. We’ve released machine-checkable security models this week and are continuing to work on additional security improvements. Remember that prompt injection is still an industry-wide unsolved problem, so it’s important to use strong models and to study our security best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s next? Security remains our top priority. We’re also focused on gateway reliability and adding polish plus support for more models and providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project has grown far beyond what I could maintain alone. Over the last few days I’ve worked on adding maintainers and we’re slowly setting up processes so we can deal with the insane influx of PRs and Issues. I’m also figuring out how to pay maintainers properly—full-time if possible. If you wanna help, consider contributing or sponsoring the org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thank You&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the Claw Crew—every clawtributor who’s shipped code, filed issues, joined our Discord, or just tried the project: thank you. You are what makes OpenClaw special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lobster has molted into its final form. Welcome to OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get started: openclaw.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join the Claw Crew: Discord&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Star on GitHub: github.com/openclaw/openclaw&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— Peter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.S. Yes, the mascot is still a lobster. Some things are sacred. 🦞&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46820783</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:14:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How AI assistance impacts the formation of coding skills</title><link>https://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="b720e598aba307c3"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research shows AI helps people do parts of their job faster. In an observational study of Claude.ai data, we found AI can speed up some tasks by 80%. But does this increased productivity come with trade-offs? Other research shows that when people use AI assistance, they become less engaged with their work and reduce the effort they put into doing it—in other words, they offload their thinking to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether this cognitive offloading can prevent people from growing their skills on the job, or—in the case of coding—understanding the systems they’re building. Our latest study, a randomized controlled trial with software developers as participants, investigates this potential downside of using AI at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This question has broad implications—for how to design AI products that facilitate learning, for how workplaces should approach AI policies, and for broader societal resilience, among others. We focused on coding, a field where AI tools have rapidly become standard. Here, AI creates a potential tension: as coding grows more automated and speeds up work, humans will still need the skills to catch errors, guide output, and ultimately provide oversight for AI deployed in high-stakes environments. Does AI provide a shortcut to both skill development and increased efficiency? Or do productivity increases from AI assistance undermine skill development?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a randomized controlled trial, we examined 1) how quickly software developers picked up a new skill (in this case, a Python library) with and without AI assistance; and 2) whether using AI made them less likely to understand the code they’d just written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found that using AI assistance led to a statistically significant decrease in mastery. On a quiz that covered concepts they’d used just a few minutes before, participants in the AI group scored 17% lower than those who coded by hand, or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades. Using AI sped up the task slightly, but this didn’t reach the threshold of statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, using AI assistance didn’t guarantee a lower score. How someone used AI influenced how much information they retained. The participants who showed stronger mastery used AI assistance not just to produce code but to build comprehension while doing so—whether by asking follow-up questions, requesting explanations, or posing conceptual questions while coding independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Study design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recruited 52 (mostly junior) software engineers, each of whom had been using Python at least once a week for over a year. We also made sure they were at least somewhat familiar with AI coding assistance, and were unfamiliar with Trio, the Python library on which our tasks were based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We split the study into three parts: a warm-up; the main task consisting of coding two different features using Trio (which requires understanding concepts related to asynchronous programming, a skill often learned in a professional setting); and a quiz. We told participants that a quiz would follow the task, but encouraged them to work as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We designed the coding task to mimic how someone might learn a new tool through a self-guided tutorial. Each participant was given a problem description, starter code, and a brief explanation of the Trio concepts needed to solve it. We used an online coding platform with an AI assistant in the sidebar which had access to participants’ code and could at any time produce the correct code if asked.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Evaluation design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our evaluation design, we drew on research in computer science education to identify four types of questions commonly used to assess mastery of coding skills:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debugging: The ability to identify and diagnose errors in code. This skill is crucial for detecting when AI-generated code is incorrect and understanding why it fails.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code reading: The ability to read and comprehend what code does. This skill enables humans to understand and verify AI-written code before deployment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code writing: The ability to write or select the correct approach to writing code. Low-level code writing, like remembering the syntax of functions, will be less important with the further integration of AI coding tools than high-level system design.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conceptual: The ability to understand the core principles behind tools and libraries. Conceptual understanding is critical for assessing whether AI-generated code uses appropriate software design patterns that adhere to how the library is intended to be used.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our assessment focused most heavily on debugging, code reading, and conceptual problems, as we considered these the most important for providing oversight of what is increasingly likely to be AI-generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On average, participants in the AI group finished about two minutes faster, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was, however, a significant difference in test scores: the AI group averaged 50% on the quiz, compared to 67% in the hand-coding group—or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades (Cohen's d=0.738, p=0.01). The largest gap in scores between the two groups was on debugging questions, suggesting that the ability to understand when code is incorrect and why it fails may be a particular area of concern if AI impedes coding development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Qualitative analysis: AI interaction modes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were particularly interested in understanding how participants went about completing the tasks we designed. In our qualitative analysis, we manually annotated screen recordings to identify how much time participants spent composing queries, what types of questions they asked, the types of errors they made, and how much time they spent actively coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One surprising result was how much time participants spent interacting with the AI assistant. Several took up to 11 minutes (30% of the total time allotted) composing up to 15 queries. This helped to explain why, on average, participants using AI finished faster although the productivity improvement was not statistically significant. We expect AI would be more likely to significantly increase productivity when used on repetitive or familiar tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, participants in the No AI group encountered more errors. These included errors in syntax and in Trio concepts, the latter of which mapped directly to topics tested on the evaluation. Our hypothesis is that the participants who encountered more Trio errors (namely, the control group) likely improved their debugging skills through resolving these errors independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then grouped participants by how they interacted with AI, identifying distinct patterns that led to different outcomes in completion time and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low-scoring interaction patterns: The low-scoring patterns generally involved a heavy reliance on AI, either through code generation or debugging. The average quiz scores in this group were less than 40%. They showed less independent thinking and more cognitive offloading. We further separated them into:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI delegation (n=4): Participants in this group wholly relied on AI to write code and complete the task. They completed the task the fastest and encountered few or no errors in the process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Progressive AI reliance (n=4): Participants in this group started by asking one or two questions but eventually delegated all code writing to the AI assistant. They scored poorly on the quiz largely due to not mastering any of the concepts on the second task.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterative AI debugging (n=4): Participants in this group relied on AI to debug or verify their code. They asked more questions, but relied on the assistant to solve problems, rather than to clarify their own understanding. They scored poorly as a result, and were also slower at completing the two tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-scoring interaction patterns: We considered high-scoring quiz patterns to be behaviors where the average quiz score was 65% or higher. Participants in these clusters used AI both for code generation and conceptual queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generation-then-comprehension (n=2): Participants in this group first generated code and then manually copied or pasted the code into their work. After their code was generated, they asked the AI assistant follow-up questions to improve understanding. These participants were not particularly fast when using AI, but showed a higher level of understanding on the quiz. Interestingly, this approach looked nearly the same as that of the AI delegation group, except for the fact that they used AI to check their own understanding.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hybrid code-explanation (n=3): Participants in this group composed hybrid queries in which they asked for code generation along with explanations of the generated code. Reading and understanding the explanations they asked for took more time, but helped in their comprehension.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conceptual inquiry (n=7): Participants in this group only asked conceptual questions and relied on their improved understanding to complete the task. Although this group encountered many errors, they also independently resolved them. On average, this mode was the fastest among high-scoring patterns and second fastest overall, after AI delegation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our qualitative analysis does not draw a causal link between interaction patterns and learning outcomes, but it does point to behaviors associated with different learning outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that incorporating AI aggressively into the workplace, particularly with respect to software engineering, comes with trade-offs. The findings highlight that not all AI-reliance is the same: the way we interact with AI while trying to be efficient affects how much we learn. Given time constraints and organizational pressures, junior developers or other professionals may rely on AI to complete tasks as fast as possible at the cost of skill development—and notably the ability to debug issues when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though preliminary, these results suggest important considerations as companies transition to a greater ratio of AI-written to human-written code. Productivity benefits may come at the cost of skills necessary to validate AI-written code if junior engineers’ skill development has been stunted by using AI in the first place. Managers should think intentionally about how to deploy AI tools at scale, and consider systems or intentional design choices that ensure engineers continue to learn as they work—and are thus able to exercise meaningful oversight over the systems they build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For novice workers in software engineering or any other industry, our study can be viewed as a small piece of evidence toward the value of intentional skill development with AI tools. Cognitive effort—and even getting painfully stuck—is likely important for fostering mastery. This is also a lesson that applies to how individuals choose to work with AI, and which tools they use. Major LLM services also provide learning modes (e.g., Claude Code Learning and Explanatory mode or ChatGPT Study Mode) designed to foster understanding. Knowing how people learn when using AI can also help guide how we design it; AI assistance should enable humans to work more efficiently and develop new skills at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior studies have found mixed results on whether AI helps or hinders coding productivity. Our own research found that AI can reduce the time it takes to complete some work tasks by 80%—a result that may seem in tension with the findings presented here. But the two studies ask different questions and use different methods: our earlier observational work measured productivity on tasks where participants already had the relevant skills, while this study examines what happens when people are learning something new. It is possible that AI both accelerates productivity on well-developed skills and hinders the acquisition of new ones, though more research is needed to understand this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study is only a first step towards uncovering how human-AI collaboration affects the experience of workers. Our sample was relatively small, and our assessment measured comprehension shortly after the coding task. Whether immediate quiz performance predicts longer-term skill development is an important question this study does not resolve. There remain many unanswered questions we hope future studies will investigate, for example: the effects of AI on tasks beyond coding, whether this effect dissipates longitudinally as engineers develop greater fluency, and whether AI assistance differs from human assistance while learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, to accommodate skill development in the presence of AI, we need a more expansive view of the impacts of AI on workers. In an AI-augmented workplace, productivity gains matter, but so does the long-term development of the expertise those gains depend on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Computers and Society&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 28 Jan 2026]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:How AI Impacts Skill Formation&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:AI assistance produces significant productivity gains across professional domains, particularly for novice workers. Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Judy Hanwen Shen [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Wed, 28 Jan 2026 04:40:43 UTC (2,680 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.CY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GOG is planning a Linux-native GOG Galaxy, calling Linux the 'next major frontier.'&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GOG is hiring a senior engineer to shape Galaxy's architecture for Linux from day one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native Galaxy will let Linux users relive classics without the usual headaches.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaming on Linux used to be in a nasty catch-22. People wouldn't develop games for Linux because gamers didn't use it, and gamers didn't use Linux because people wouldn't develop games for it. However, with the advancement of tech like Proton, we're beginning to see people take Linux seriously as a gaming powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, that doesn't mean that the Linux community won't welcome developers who create Linux-native versions of their games and related apps. So, when the news broke that GOG was hiring a developer to help get its library app over into the world of FOSS, it was good news for everyone who wants to bring the classics over to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;GOG's new owner details how he plans to take on Steam: publish less chaff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a world of monopolies, GOG wants a niche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GOG calls Linux "a major frontier" as it aims to make Galaxy Linux-native&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It's the next step in GOG's plans to appeal to Linux users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've never heard of GOG before, it stands for 'Good Old Games,' and its name gives away what kind of titles it sells. It's not all classic games, though; sometimes the company will publish newer titles with a retro feel to them that feel at home on the platform. Recently, the original co-founder of GOG bought the store back from its previous owner, CD Projekt Red, and declared they would survive under Steam's shadow by vetting games published on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, it seems they're making efforts to bring GOG over to Linux. As spotted by VideoCardz, a recent job advertisement on the GOG website revealed that the company is hiring a senior engineer to help with its optional library app, GOG Galaxy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;GOG GALAXY is our desktop client and ecosystem hub - the place where players manage their libraries, connect with the community, and access features that go far beyond a store. Today, it delivers experience on Windows and macOS, but Linux is the next major frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who will help shape GOG GALAXY’s architecture, tooling, and development standards with Linux in mind from day one. At the same time, GOG GALAXY is a long-lived product with a large and complex C++ codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While you don't need GOG Galaxy to play your purchased games, it's still nice to see the company working on making an app that runs on Linux natively. Here's hoping it's the first of many tweaks GOG is making to help Linux users relive the classics without any of the headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cicada is a lightweight scripting language that runs inside of C code. For details, see the website:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;http://heltilda.github.io/cicada&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installation: From the command prompt go into the Cicada download directory, and type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; ./configure&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; make&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; make install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to use: Include the Cicada header file in your C code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;cicada.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and pass an &lt;code&gt;lcicada&lt;/code&gt; option to the linker:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;gcc -lcicada -o myprogram ...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest way to run Cicada is to call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;runCicada(NULL, NULL, true);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story was produced and originally published by Wisconsin Watch, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom. It was made possible by donors like you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did a $1 billion, 520-acre data center proposed by one of the world’s richest companies go unnoticed in tiny Beaver Dam, Wisconsin?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key reason: In a city that lists “communication matters” atop its core values, officials took steps to keep the project hidden for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;News with a little more humanity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WPR’s “Wisconsin Today” newsletter keeps you connected to the state you love without feeling overwhelmed. No paywall. No agenda. No corporate filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now Meta, the trillion-dollar company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is building a complex as big as 12 football fields in a city with a population of 16,000, enough to fill only a fifth of Lambeau Field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s one of seven major data center projects pending in Wisconsin that combined are worth more than $57 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In four of them, including Beaver Dam, local government officials kept the massive projects under wraps through confidential nondisclosure agreements, a Wisconsin Watch investigation has found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secrecy also occurred in the three communities without NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one, the Madison suburb of DeForest, officials worked behind the scenes for months before publicly announcing a proposed $12 billion data center, which residents are fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of public disclosure, while relatively common for typical development proposals in the planning stages, raises questions about how much time the public should have to digest projects that dramatically affect the economy, land use, energy, taxes, the environment and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As soon as community leadership is contemplating, even entertaining it, I think they need to make the public aware,” said retired tech executive Prescott Balch, who is advising residents around Wisconsin where data centers are proposed. “Even if it makes it harder, that’s the right way to do it. And nobody is doing it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blowback from residents who have been kept in the dark has spurred a new legislative proposal that would ban data center NDAs statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Beaver Dam did it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin has some 40 data centers, stretching from Kenosha to Eau Claire. But most are tiny compared with the big seven: three under construction in Beaver Dam, Mount Pleasant and Port Washington; and four proposed in DeForest, Janesville, Kenosha and Menomonie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides storing and processing data, data centers are vital to advancing the use of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A case study in how projects each worth $1 billion or more are kept quiet is Beaver Dam, the Dodge County burg an hour northeast of Madison, where Meta’s data center is expected to open in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beaver Dam Area Development Corp., a quasi-government nonprofit that functions as the city’s economic development arm, signed an NDA on Dec. 1, 2023, not with Meta, but with a shell company no one had ever heard of, Balloonist LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agreement referred only to a “project,” making no mention of a data center or Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA was signed “very early, almost in the introductory period of that project,” the development corporation’s leader, Trent Campbell, told Wisconsin Watch. All major development projects have “different levels of confidentiality for different purposes. And this entity believed it to be necessary at the onset of the conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA meant that the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. could not reveal its discussions with Balloonist, or even disclose “the existence of the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA also put the wheels in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than a year, the city quietly took official actions to make the data center a reality, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2024: The city council voted 12-0 to approve a predevelopment agreement with another shell company, Degas LLC, that only later was identified with the data center. The agenda and the minutes of the meeting don’t mention a data center.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 2024: The city council created a tax incremental finance, or TIF, district for the data center to help fund development. The agenda and the minutes for that meeting do not mention a data center, though the agreement itself does.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not until February 2025 — 14 months after the NDA was signed — did the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. announce that it and the city were working with a company — then still unidentified — on a “potential data center project.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Campbell noted to Wisconsin Watch that Gov. Tony Evers and other officials had identified the site for a major development as far back as 2019. For months after the NDA was signed, it wasn’t known whether the data center would come to fruition, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know the opponents currently disagree, but I think the city acted in as transparent a way as they could,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, a news report in April 2025 identified Meta, which declined comment for this story, as the company likely behind the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta confirmed its involvement eight months later, saying on Facebook: “We’re proud to call Beaver Dam home. We are honored to have joined such an incredible community in 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first reply to that post was from a Beaver Dam resident, who wrote: “We would have been honored to have the opportunity to decline this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secrecy without an NDA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs also helped keep the public in the dark about data centers under consideration in the three other cities that used them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Menomonie signed its NDA with Balloonist LLC in February 2024 — more than a year before the city in northwest Wisconsin announced a $1.6 billion data center proposal in July 2025. Two months after the NDA, the city council unanimously helped pave the way for a data center by changing a land use ordinance. The change gave, for the first time, a definition of the ordinance’s reference to “warehousing,” saying warehousing includes data centers. The city’s mayor put the proposed data center on hold in September 2025. In January 2026, the city council adopted a zoning ordinance for data centers that reversed the warehousing definition. “Based upon feedback from the community and elected officials, it is clear that additional discussion should occur regarding the appropriate level of regulation of data centers,” the city’s public works director told the council and the mayor.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kenosha signed its NDA, with Microsoft, in May 2024, six months before news reports surfaced saying the NDA kept the proposed data center operator’s name confidential. It was later announced that Microsoft had purchased 240 acres in the neighboring town of Paris, which the city annexed in December 2024. No dollar amount for the proposal has been announced.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Janesville announced in July 2025 it was approached by developers about a data center and put out a request for proposal. The city signed its NDA two months later and is now in negotiations with Viridian Acquisitions, a Colorado developer, for an $8 billion data center.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Port Washington in Ozaukee County and Mount Pleasant in Racine County responded to records requests from Wisconsin Watch saying they had not signed NDAs for their data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Port Washington, where three people were arrested during a city council meeting on the data center in December, residents are trying to recall Mayor Ted Neitzke, saying he has been secretive about the $15 billion data center from OpenAI, Oracle and Vantage Data Centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Mount Pleasant, Microsoft this month announced plans to add 15 data centers, worth $13 billion, to the $7 billion complex under construction there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs are described by economic development officials as necessary and criticized by data center opponents as against the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs and other steps to protect confidentiality are crucial at the early stages of a development proposal, said Tricia Braun, executive director of the Wisconsin Data Center Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If I’m a company considering making strategic investments, regardless of industry, I don’t want my competition to know where I’m going, what I’m doing, what pace I’m doing it at,” said Braun, a former executive at the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. “You want to make sure everything is buttoned up and bow tied before that type of information is put into the public realm.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Questions have swirled around transparency even in communities where local government officials did not sign NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That includes DeForest, which lists “communicate clearly” among its core values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DeForest data center, proposed by Virginia-based QTS Data Centers, is controversial, in part, because the village board would have to annex 1,600 acres in the neighboring town of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At one DeForest Village Board meeting about the project, Village President Jane Cahill Wolfgram said that based on emails she had been receiving from residents, there was “just one thing I think we need to clear up.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And you can ask any one of these board members. They will tell you, they just learned about this project in the last couple of weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was Nov. 18, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Village Board trustees had been offered one-on-one meetings with the developer some 10 weeks earlier, trustee Jan Steffenhagen-Hahn said in an email to Vienna resident Shawn Haney.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because of the scale of this project,” that’s when residents should have been notified, said Haney, a leader of a group that opposes the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other emails obtained by the group show that DeForest staff were strategizing with QTS representatives and Alliant Energy as early as March 2025 — seven months before announcing the proposal last October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one email, the village planner discussed with QTS representatives when to seek various village approvals, including annexation, while acknowledging that doing so without disclosing “any details of the project or operations will be difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cahill Wolfgram told Wisconsin Watch she in fact had met with QTS on Oct. 1, three weeks before the public announcement. She expressed frustration that many residents are urging trustees to stop the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’ve been brought in from the very early moments of this discussion and they have continued to be front and center of everything we’ve done,” Cahill Wolfgram said. “As village president, I know of nothing that has been done behind the scenes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A public hearing on the annexation is scheduled for Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state Department of Administration, which reviews annexation proposals and issues advisory opinions, concluded the DeForest annexation is not in the public interest because of concerns over how the village would provide water and sewer services for the annexed area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin has called for state leaders to pause consideration of any data centers until a comprehensive strategy on them is adopted. In part, the coalition said comprehensive planning is needed to avoid more “stranded assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin Watch reported in December that Wisconsin utility ratepayers owe nearly $1 billion for stranded assets — coal power plants that have been or soon will be shut down. A push to provide new energy capacity for data centers poses the risk of creating more stranded assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some states targeting NDAs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Jan. 13 announced new standards aimed at being a “good neighbor in the communities where we build, own and operate our data centers.” It mentioned transparency five times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researchers called Microsoft’s initial Mount Pleasant data center a “microcosm of a larger problem with secrecy and lack of transparency about water and electricity demands” of data centers throughout the country. That, they wrote, “harms the public’s ability to determine whether hosting a data center is in their best interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount Pleasant has wanted a major development where the data center is now under construction because a massive development signed with Foxconn in 2017 largely fell through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local government use of NDAs and other methods to keep data center development secret is widespread across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, local elected officials were aware of data center proposals for months or even years before disclosing them. In Virginia, 25 out of 31 data center projects had NDAs. In one New Mexico county, county staff negotiated for a $165 billion data center with an NDA that kept elected officials in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several states are targeting NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least three — Florida, Michigan and New Jersey — are considering legislation to prohibit governments from signing data center NDAs. A Georgia bill would prohibit NDAs that hide information about data center electricity or water usage. New York is considering a bill to limit NDAs for economic development proposals generally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, similar legislation is pending in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, state Rep. Clint Moses, R-Menomonie, citing questions about transparency over the Menomonie proposal, introduced a bill to prohibit NDAs for data center proposals in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ve never seen such overwhelming opposition from all sides of the aisle,” he told Wisconsin Watch, describing constituents’ feelings about data centers and secrecy surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moses said he understands the need for confidentiality in economic development generally, but that because data centers have such widespread impact, public notice is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The earlier the better,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Braun, the data centers coalition leader, said the public should be notified when a data center proposal is ready to be considered for approvals by elected officials — after municipal staff do due diligence to determine whether things such as zoning, utility capacity, water and sewer would make a proposal potentially viable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Balch, who helped defeat a proposed data center in the Racine County village of Caledonia, where he lives, said the public should be alerted well before local elected officials consider such votes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You have to use your judgment,” he said. “But at some point, you need to realize this is not a normal thing and we need to look out for the residents.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Every popular agent framework runs LLM-generated code via &lt;code&gt;subprocess&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt;. That's arbitrary code execution on your host. One prompt injection and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some frameworks offer Docker isolation (OpenHands, AutoGen), but that requires running a Docker daemon and managing container infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;amla-sandbox is a WASM sandbox with capability enforcement. Agents can only call tools you explicitly provide, with constraints you define. Sandboxed virtual filesystem. No network. No shell escape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv pip install "git+https://github.com/amlalabs/amla-sandbox"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No Docker. No VM. One binary, works everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import create_sandbox_tool

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(tools=[stripe_api, database])

# Agent writes one script instead of 10 tool calls (JavaScript)
result = sandbox.run('''
    const txns = await stripe.listTransactions({customer: "cus_123"});
    const disputed = txns.filter(t =&amp;gt; t.disputed);
    console.log(disputed[0]);
''', language="javascript")

# Or with shell pipelines
result = sandbox.run('''
    tool stripe.listTransactions --customer cus_123 | jq '[.[] | select(.disputed)] | .[0]'
''', language="shell")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tool-calling is expensive. Every MCP call is a round trip through the model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;LLM → tool → LLM → tool → LLM → tool → ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten tool calls = ten LLM invocations. Code mode collapses this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;LLM → script that does all 10 things → result
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you can't just eval whatever the model spits out. So people either pay the token tax or run unsafe code. This gives you both: code-mode efficiency with actual isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sandbox runs inside WebAssembly with WASI for a minimal syscall interface. WASM provides memory isolation by design—linear memory is bounds-checked, and there's no way to escape to the host address space. The wasmtime runtime we use is built with defense-in-depth and has been formally verified for memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of WASM isolation, every tool call goes through capability validation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import Sandbox, MethodCapability, ConstraintSet, Param

# This fails - amount exceeds capability
sandbox.execute('await stripe.charges.create({amount: 50000, currency: "USD"})')&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design draws from capability-based security as implemented in systems like seL4—access is explicitly granted, not implicitly available. Agents don't get ambient authority just because they're running in your process. This matters because prompt injection is a fundamental unsolved problem; defense in depth through capability restriction limits the blast radius.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Categories:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new typeface for Aardman’s iconic duo – meet Buttered Crumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was thrilled to be selected to design a custom typeface for Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit – Aardman’s most beloved and recognisable characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brief called for a font with a distinct tone of voice that could work seamlessly across film, print and digital, while bringing warmth and continuity to their next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Method&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We began by exploring warm, characterful styles, taking inspiration from Oswald Cooper’s original drawings for Cooper Black. We then took a creative turn, developing a softer, low-contrast design with a distinctly hand-crafted feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each letterform was carefully shaped to feel expressive yet balanced, with serifs that resemble loaves of bread – a nod to Aardman’s tactile, playful world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outcomes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The finished typeface – Buttered Crumpet – gives Aardman a timeless, familiar tone of voice with bundles of charm. It includes over 200 characters, covering all Western European languages, and was designed in a single, carefully crafted weight with room for future expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a Bristol-based designer, it was a joy to create a lasting connection with my home city and one of its most renowned creative studios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I’ve loved rolling out this typeface and we’re starting to see it in action now. There have been lots of compliments.&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Background/Objectives: Dementia, characterised by cognitive decline, significantly impacts language abilities. While the risk of dementia increases with age, it often manifests years before clinical diagnosis. Identifying early warning signs is crucial for timely intervention. Previous research has demonstrated that changes in language, such as reduced vocabulary diversity and simpler sentence structures, may be observed in individuals with dementia. This study investigates the potential of linguistic analysis to detect early signs of cognitive decline by examining the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett, a renowned author diagnosed with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), typically a form of dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. Methods: This study analysed 33 Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett, comparing linguistic features before and after a potential turning point identified through analysis of adjective type-token ratios (TTR). Results: A significant decrease in lexical diversity (TTR) was observed for nouns and adjectives in later works. Total wordcount increased, while lexical diversity decreased, suggesting a shift towards simpler language. This shift coincided with a decrease in adjective TTR below a defined threshold, occurring approximately ten years before Pratchett’s formal diagnosis. Conclusions: These findings suggest that subtle changes in linguistic patterns, such as decreased lexical diversity, may precede clinical diagnosis of dementia by a considerable margin. This research highlights the potential of linguistic analysis as a valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the specific linguistic markers associated with different types of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dementia is an umbrella term for a range of conditions involving neurodegeneration or other aetiologies that result in significant cognitive decline, the most common of which is Alzheimer’s disease [1]. The cognitive decline observed in people with Alzheimer’s disease involves the gradual accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta and tau proteins causing neuronal damage [2], so identifying those people with signs of Alzheimer’s-related cognitive decline as early as possible would enable interventions to be utilised to delay or even prevent some of the damage. People with dementia may first notice they have an issue when they experience increased episodes of confusion or issues with memory or language (e.g., [3]). However, Alzheimer’s pathology likely begins many years and perhaps decades before the onset of symptoms [4]. Indeed, research has shown that there are earlier warning signs of dementia which may be too subtle for a patient to be aware of, for example, problems with attention (e.g., [5]). Further, research suggests that it is currently possible to predict who will experience dementia 12 years prior to formal diagnosis [6]. Therefore, it may be possible to identify at-risk people before their cognitive decline worsens. Dementia has an effect on both speech and writing (e.g., [7,8]); therefore, measuring the first signs of decline in these functions may provide an early biomarker for dementia. In early-stage Alzheimer’s, researchers have observed impairments in both producing and understanding words and sentences [9]. Therefore, by looking for changes in how someone uses language, then this may provide an early warning sign for dementia. The complexity of sentence structure, as measured by factors like the number of clauses per utterance, decreases with age in both spoken and written language [10]. Older adults struggle more with complex sentence structures, such as those with left-branching clauses, compared to younger adults [11].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, linguistic changes are to be expected as people age (e.g., [12]). However, these changes become more profound within people with cognitive decline (e.g., [13]). If a patient’s writing history is available, then linguistic analysis techniques could be used to supplement clinical assessments or as a standalone early detection tool. Recent studies have done exactly this by measuring individual writers’ publications over their careers to analyse how their language use has evolved. Garrard et al. [14] studied the works of Iris Murdoch, a renowned English author who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s posthumously. Her final novel, published shortly before her diagnosis, is widely considered to exhibit signs of cognitive decline. While Garrard found minimal differences in overall structure and syntax, they observed significant and consistent variations in lexical diversity and word choice between the final book and control books from earlier in Murdoch’s career. These results provide evidence that Alzheimer’s may indeed be measured using linguistic analysis, specifically the number of unique word-types relative to the overall wordcount. Le et al. [15] explored this further by including additional authors, additional books, and improved analysis techniques. Le et al. analysed two authors believed to have Alzheimer’s disease during their careers, Iris Murdoch and Agatha Christie, as well as P.D. James to act as a control participant, who published until the age of 88 without experiencing evidence of cognitive decline. They included twenty of Murdoch’s twenty-six novels, published between ages 35 and 76, sixteen of Christie’s novels written between ages 28 and 82, and fifteen of the novels of P.D. James. They then produced an analysis of the novels at the lexical level, using a variety of measures, including vocabulary size, lexical repetition, lexical specificity, word-class deficits, and fillers. Type-token ratio (TTR: e.g., [16]) calculates the proportion of unique words to the total wordcount, and the word-type introduction rate (WTIR: e.g., [17]), which measures the rate at which new words are introduced in the text, calculated every 10,000 words. Regarding lexical repetition, while intentional repetition can be a stylistic device, an increasing rate of repeated words may suggest a limited vocabulary or difficulty accessing words. To examine this, they conducted two analyses: a global analysis and a local analysis. Lexical specificity is calculated by the frequency of indefinite nouns and high-frequency, low-imagery verbs in each text. A higher proportion of these generic words suggests lower overall lexical specificity. Word class deficit (WCD: e.g., [18]) is an analysis of the distribution of word classes across each text, examining both the total number of words and the number of unique words. This allows for identification of potential deficits or overreliance on specific word classes and to measure the vocabulary size of open classes. Filler words are a measure of the proportion of interjections and filler words. While these words often appear in dialogue, fiction authors strive for natural-sounding conversations. However, this measure may be influenced by stylistic choices rather than cognitive decline and should be interpreted with care. Le, et al. observed that P.D. James maintained stable linguistic diversity into their late 80s, whereas, for Iris Murdoch and Agatha Christie TTR and WTIR were associated with cognitive decline and a decline in vocabulary led to an increase in repetitions in content words, and a word-class deficit can be seen in noun-token proportion, with a compensatory increase in verb-token proportion. They also observed a deficit in noun tokens that is significantly correlated with a rise in verb and pronoun tokens. Syntactic-complexity results were also found to fluctuate in a relatively wider range. Interestingly, they also report that deficits in Murdoch’s writing appeared in Murdoch’s late 40s and early 50s, which suggests that language deficits are observed many years before a formal diagnosis and indicates that Alzheimer’s disease has a long preclinical period. Therefore, linguistic analysis would appear to show promise in identifying whether an author has experienced cognitive decline and may even indicate when the preclinical phase of dementia has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current research further explores the idea of using lexical analysis in dementia by studying the works of Sir Terry Pratchett. Terry Pratchett was an English author, humourist, and satirist, best known for his Discworld series of 41 comic fantasy novels published between 1983 and 2015. Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) in December 2007. This diagnosis came at a time when he was still actively writing and publishing his beloved Discworld series. Despite the challenges posed by his condition, Pratchett continued to write and advocate for dementia awareness until his passing in 2015. PCA is a rare form of Alzheimer’s disease that primarily affects visual processing and spatial awareness [19]: although note that 15% of PCA cases may be unrelated to AD pathology; see [20]. It affects areas in the back of the brain responsible for spatial perception, complex visual processing, spelling, and calculation [21]. PCA has also been found to be associated with word retrieval difficulties [22]. Given Terry Pratchett’s prolific writing career and the fact he continued writing after his diagnosis, a linguistic analysis of his novels could provide valuable insights into the potential early signs of cognitive decline. By comparing his earlier works to his later ones, particularly those written closer to his dementia diagnosis, it would be possible to identify subtle changes in linguistic patterns, such as decreased lexical diversity, and a decline in the use of specific word classes, such as nouns and adjectives, potentially preceding clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study further explores the potential of lexical analysis as a tool for the early detection of cognitive decline by examining the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett, an author diagnosed with PCA. By analysing his Discworld series, it may be possible to identify subtle changes in linguistic patterns, specifically lexical diversity, that may have occurred prior to his formal diagnosis. Novels from the Discworld series were analysed to identify subtle changes in linguistic patterns, specifically lexical diversity as measured by TTR and Moving Average TTR (MATTR: e.g., [23]). The analysis focuses on whether these measures changed over time and their accuracy in predicting the linguistic changes associated with his diagnosis is evaluated. These findings may have implications for the use of lexical analysis in dementia research, highlighting its potential as a supplementary tool for early detection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Materials and Methods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.1. Materials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lexical diversity was quantified across 33 of the 41 novels in the Discworld series. Eight titles were excluded from the analysis due to them being either shorter than the other full-length novels (Eric, 1990; The Last Hero, 2001), or because they are part of his titles for younger readers (The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents, 2001; The Wee Free Men, 2003; A Hat Full of Sky, 2004; Wintersmith, 2006; I Shall Wear Midnight, 2010; The Shepherds Crown, 2015). These eight titles were excluded to ensure the validity of the lexical analysis. TTR is highly sensitive to text length; therefore, shorter works (e.g., Eric, which was originally published as an illustrated picture book) would yield artificially inflated diversity scores compared to full-length novels. Additionally, works written for younger readers were omitted because linguistic constraints and vocabulary choices for children differ fundamentally from those used in the main series. By focusing on a homogeneous corpus of adult-marketed, full-length novels, we ensured that observed changes reflect cognitive status rather than shifts in intended audience or format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.2. Data Extraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analysis focused on four major lexical word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. The corpus-analysis platform SketchEngine [24] was selected for data extraction because it supports large corpora, provides reliable part-of-speech tagging, and allows the retrieval of lemma-level frequency counts for specified word classes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plain-text versions of the 33 eligible novels were uploaded to SketchEngine. For each book, the number of unique lemmas in each word class was divided by the total number of tokens of that class, yielding a class-specific TTR. These measures provided an initial estimate of lexical diversity across the corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To investigate potential effects of cognitive decline, novels were grouped according to publication relative to Pratchett’s PCA diagnosis in 2007: 29 books were classified as pre-diagnosis and 4 as post-diagnosis. Because TTR is sensitive to text length and unequal token counts across books, we additionally computed the moving-average type–token ratio (MATTR) with a fixed window size of 100 words. MATTR normalises diversity estimates across texts of different lengths and provides a more stable measure of lexical variation. These MATTR values were then included in subsequent statistical comparisons of pre- and post-diagnosis linguistic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MATTR is widely regarded as one of the most robust normalised diversity metrics, as it maintains sensitivity to lexical variation while minimising the length dependency that affects traditional TTR measures. Importantly, MATTR offers advantages over alternative normalisation procedures such as random sampling, fixed-sample TTR, or computationally intensive indices such as Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) or Hypergeometric Distribution (HD-D). Random sampling or fixed-sample TTR can introduce instability when texts differ markedly in style or local density of lexical items, while MTLD and HD-D, although informative, are more sensitive to distributional irregularities and may produce inflated variability when applied to long narrative texts. In contrast, MATTR computes TTR across overlapping windows, ensuring that all parts of a text contribute equally. This property makes MATTR particularly well suited for comparing long-form prose of variable length, such as the Discworld novels, and for detecting subtle changes in lexical choices over time. These MATTR values were therefore used in the statistical comparisons of pre- and post-diagnosis linguistic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.3. Statistical Analyses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarise the key linguistic features used in Pratchett’s books. Independent t-tests were used to compare linguistic measures released before and after the dementia diagnosis. Linear regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between various TTR types and age. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to evaluate the accuracy of TTR measures in distinguishing between pre- and post-diagnosis phases. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 29), with the significance level set at p &amp;lt; 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.1. Pre- and Post-Dementia Diagnosis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analysis included 33 books (see Table 1), with 29 books written before the dementia diagnosis and four books written after the diagnosis. Independent t-tests were conducted to compare linguistic features between these periods (see Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Table 1. Descriptive statistics for all the variables extracted from Pratchett’s Discworld books. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Table 2. Comparisons of Linguistic Features Pre- and Post-Dementia Diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analysis showed significant changes in several linguistic features following Pratchett’s dementia diagnosis. Books written after diagnosis showed a decrease in lexical diversity, as shown by significant lower type-token ratios for nouns (p = 0.044) and adjectives (p = 0.028). No significant changes were observed in the TTRs for verbs and adverbs, suggesting that some aspects of linguistic complexity remained stable after the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.2. Decline in Lexical Diversity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows the changes in TTR across different word classes (adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) in Pratchett’s writing over time. All word classes demonstrated a declining trend in TTR with age, indicating a general decrease in lexical diversity. Linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between various TTRs and Pratchett’s age. All models showed significant predictive relationships (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The TTR for adjectives emerged as the strongest predictor (F(1,31) = 73.101, p &amp;lt; 0.001), followed by adverb TTR (F(1,31) = 53.694, p &amp;lt; 0.001), noun TTR (F(1,31) = 45.728, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and verb TTR (F(1,31) = 39.413, p &amp;lt; 0.001) also showed significant relationships with Pratchett’s age-related progression. These findings indicate that age-related progression is a significant predictor of the observed decline in lexical diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Figure 1. Type/token ratio over time in Pratchett’s Discworld books. Note, “age” represents Pratchett’s age when each book was published. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.3. Identification of Change Point&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the accuracy of various TTR measures in detecting linguistic changes associated with dementia (see Figure 2). All TTR measures demonstrated significant predictive ability (p &amp;lt; 0.05), with AUC values ranging from 0.80 to 0.91.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The TTR for adjectives showed the highest classification accuracy (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80–1.02, p &amp;lt; 0.001: see Table 3), with a cut-off value of 0.227 showing 76% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This was followed by adverb TTR (AUC = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.76–1.04, p &amp;lt; 0.001), which demonstrated 96% sensitivity and 75% specificity at a cut-off of 0.062. Noun TTR also showed strong predictive performance (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.73–1.00, p &amp;lt; 0.001), with 86% sensitivity and 75% specificity at a cut-off of 0.182. Verb TTR show relatively lower but significant accuracy (AUC = 0.80, p = 0.001). Verb TTR achieved highest specificity (100%) but lower sensitivity (62%) at a cut-off of 0.072.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Table 3. Area Under the Curve results for each TTR variable. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As TTR for adjectives showed the highest diagnostic accuracy, we can use the cut-off value of 0.227 to identify when in Pratchett’s writing his TTR for adjectives started to fall below this cut-off score. It was found that eleven of Pratchett’s works were found to have a TTR for adjectives lower than 0.227, with the earliest published being The Last Continent (Discworld 22), which was published in May 1998—9 years and 7 months before his formal diagnosis. All books published after this date were found to have a TTR for adjectives of less than 0.227 whilst all books published before this date were found to have a TTR for adjectives more than 0.227. The only outliers are Discworlds 23 (Carpe Jugulum) and 25 (The Truth), which both had scores of 0.228, which do not meet the cut-off despite being published after Discworld 22, but are only 0.001 outside the cut-off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.4. Pre- and Post-Change Point Analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Discworld 22 was the first book to fall below the TTR for adjectives cut-offs, independent t-tests were performed on pre and post Discworld 22 to compare linguistic features between these periods (see Table 4).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Table 4. Comparisons of Linguistic Features Pre- and Post-Discworld 22. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analysis showed a decrease in lexical diversity, as shown by significant lower type-token ratios for nouns: p &amp;lt; 0.001; verbs: p &amp;lt; 0.001; adjectives: p &amp;lt; 0.001; and adverbs: p &amp;lt; 0.001. These results indicate overall that linguistic features differed on all aspects pre and post Discworld 22.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.5. Moving Average Type Token Ratio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the total number of words per book was found to significantly differ pre (M = 87,197; SD = 14,372) and post (M = 116,152; SD = 12,303) book 22 (t(31) = 5.972; p &amp;lt; 0.001), which may affect TTR scores. Therefore, to control for this each TTR score was standardised by calculating the estimated moving average type token ratio (MATTR) with a window set at every 100 words. Independent t-tests were then performed on pre and post Discworld 22 books to compare linguistic features between these periods. It was found that even after controlling for word total, all MATTRs (noun, verb, adjective, adverb) differed significantly pre and post Discworld 22 (see Table 5). These results indicate that book word total did not account for the significant differences in TTRs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Table 5. Comparisons of Standardised TTRs Pre- and Post-Discworld 22. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Discussion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current study aimed to explore the potential of lexical analysis as a tool for early detection of cognitive decline, specifically focusing on the case of Terry Pratchett and his diagnosis of PCA due to Alzheimer’s disease. Our analysis of Pratchett’s Discworld series revealed significant changes in linguistic patterns over time. The most notable finding was a significant decrease in lexical diversity, as measured by TTR, and then MATTR, for adjectives and nouns in Pratchett’s later works. This suggests a decline in vocabulary richness and a reliance on simpler language structures. While the overall TTR remained relatively stable, the decrease in lexical diversity within specific word classes indicates a subtle but significant change in linguistic style (see [15]). Our analysis of Pratchett’s works suggests that similar lexical changes could potentially also be observed in individuals with PCA due to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high predictive accuracy of TTR measures, particularly for adjectives, suggests that lexical analysis could be a valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline. By identifying subtle changes in language use, it may be possible to detect preclinical changes in cognitive decline or even the onset of dementia years before a formal diagnosis. This early detection could enable timely interventions and potentially slow the progression of the disease. The analysis revealed a shift in Pratchett’s writing style following the publication of The Last Continent (Discworld 22). This book may indicate the point where the developing dementia pathology first becomes symptomatic, as it was the first to exhibit a TTR for adjectives below an AUC-established cut-off value of 0.227, a threshold with a high diagnostic accuracy for potentially detecting linguistic changes related to dementia in the Discworld series. To further investigate this shift, we compared linguistic features in books published before and after The Last Continent. The results revealed significant differences across various measures. Post-Last Continent books exhibited a significant decrease in lexical diversity across all word classes as measured by TTR. These findings suggest a shift in Pratchett’s writing style after this point. It should be noted that this book was published 9 years and 7 months before his formal diagnosis, indicating a long preclinical period prior to diagnosis. This observation is striking and highlights the potential for lexical analysis to identify subtle changes in writing style that may precede clinical diagnosis of dementia by a considerable margin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high classification accuracy observed in the ROC analysis (e.g., AUC = 0.91 for adjective TTR) provides robust evidence of a distinct shift in linguistic patterns following Book 22. However, it is important to distinguish between the intra-individual predictive power shown here and inter-individual clinical utility. In this study, the ROC curve functions as a tool to retrospectively identify the onset of a pathological trend within a single author’s long-term output. While these findings highlight the sensitivity of lexical diversity as a marker for preclinical cognitive decline, the specific cut-off values (such as the 0.227 threshold for adjectives) are calibrated to Pratchett’s unique baseline vocabulary and the specific genre requirements of the Discworld series. Therefore, these metrics do not serve as a universal screening tool for the general population. Instead, they demonstrate the potential for personalised, longitudinal linguistic monitoring—where a patient serves as their own control—to flag early signs of neurodegeneration that might be missed by standardised, cross-sectional cognitive assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this study. First, the analysis was based on a single case study, limiting the generalisability of the findings. The results may be specific to Pratchett; therefore, further research is needed to validate these findings in a larger sample of individuals with dementia, including those with PCA. Relatedly, as this is a single-case study, without a control author, it remains possible that the decline in lexical diversity reflects natural ageing. But note that previous research [15] has found that healthy authors can maintain stable linguistic diversity into their late 80s, suggesting that the decline observed in Pratchett’s TTR is indicative of pathology rather than typical ageing. Second, a potential limitation of the analyses is that the 33 novels, produced over a 32-year career, may naturally be correlated and thus not strictly independent. While ignoring such dependencies can violate statistical assumptions and overstate significance, treating each work as a discrete “snapshot” of the author’s cognitive state is scientifically justified. This approach views each novel as a massive, distinct creative undertaking and aligns with established methodologies used to map cognitive decline in authors like Iris Murdoch and Agatha Christie [14,15]. Third, while PCA and Alzheimer’s disease share some common features and PCA is thought to be in most cases caused by Alzheimer’s disease (see [25]), they are distinct conditions with different clinical presentations [19]. It is possible that the linguistic markers of PCA may differ from those of Alzheimer’s disease. For example, PCA often causes severe reading impairments and “pure alexia,” which disrupts the writer’s ability to visually scan and review their own text. Writers unable to effectively read their drafts may struggle to detect unwanted lexical repetitions and potentially may contribute to the observed decline in lexical richness. Furthermore, several methodological limitations should be considered. The precise chronology of Pratchett’s writing is uncertain. We do not know the exact dates of writing for each book, whether he worked on multiple books concurrently, or if the publication order accurately reflects the writing order. These uncertainties could introduce potential biases into the analysis. Additionally, the observed changes in Pratchett’s writing style after his diagnosis may not solely be attributed to PCA. Factors such as reduced writing time due to the disease, potential collaboration with other writers, or significant editorial alterations could also have contributed to these changes. Finally, it is crucial to emphasise that the observed changes in Pratchett’s writing may not exclusively reflect cognitive decline due to PCA. Age-related changes in writing style are expected, and it is possible that some of the observed changes represent natural stylistic evolution rather than disease-related decline. Further, it is also worthy of note that Pratchett was writing with full knowledge of his condition and prognosis, which may have added a powerful psychological dimension to any biological influences on the language system. Therefore, we cannot wholly attribute changes in language due to Alzheimer’s disease pathology alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of linguistic analysis as a tool for detecting early signs of cognitive decline. By analysing the works of Terry Pratchett, we have demonstrated how subtle changes in language use can be indicative of underlying cognitive impairment. Further research is needed to explore the full potential of linguistic analysis as a diagnostic tool for dementia, including the development of more sophisticated analytical methods and the investigation of larger and more diverse datasets. Future research could explore the use of computational linguistics and machine learning analysis techniques, to identify linguistic markers of cognitive decline. These techniques already show promise and are rapidly gaining attention in Alzheimer’s disease biomarker development (e.g., [26,27,28,29]). By developing more sensitive and accurate diagnostic tools, we may be able to improve early detection and intervention for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our study provides evidence that linguistic analysis can be a valuable tool for detecting early signs of cognitive decline. By analysing the works of Terry Pratchett, we have demonstrated how subtle changes in language use can be indicative of underlying cognitive impairment. The results also emphasise that language deficits may be observed many years before a formal diagnosis and indicate that Alzheimer’s disease has a long preclinical period—in the case of Terry Pratchett, potentially almost ten years. Further research is now needed to explore the full potential of linguistic analysis as a diagnostic tool for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Microsoft Just Killed the "Cover for Me" Excuse: 365 Now Tracks You in Real-Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, we all knew it was coming, but now it's official. Microsoft just handed middle managers the ultimate weapon. Their new update for Microsoft 365 allows companies to track exactly where you are, and the days of pretending to be at your desk are over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Death of the "Tech Bro" Excuse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember when you could text Dave from the office to turn your PC on because you were stuck in traffic? Yeah, those days are dead. Dead and buried.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft confirmed that starting March 2026 (delayed from January), managers will be able to see your real-time location. And no, disconnecting from the office Wi-Fi won't save you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This "feature" is hitting everything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Teams on Windows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Teams on Mac&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And obviously, the mobile app (your pocket spy).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Here is the scary part&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just about being at the office. It’s about where you are when you aren't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you connect to a Wi-Fi network that isn't your company's, Teams will simply display the name of that network. So if you decide to take a "working lunch" and connect to "Starbucks_Guest_WiFi", your boss sees it instantly. You can’t hide behind a generic "Remote" status anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They call it "coordination." I call it creepy. It feels a lot like a digital ankle monitor. For hybrid workers or anyone who values a shred of privacy, Microsoft 365 just became a lot more invasive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Amazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the rights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest bidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is scheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is unknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited amount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The $35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile documentaries have received.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s push is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate itself with President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, $28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back to the Times:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for “Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “RBG,” a portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a Supreme Court justice, in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;CNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional budget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar nominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34 theaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It ultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No. 1 political documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters overseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling distribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales are expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shocker.&lt;/p&gt;
