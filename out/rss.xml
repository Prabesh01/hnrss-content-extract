          &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About Sphere&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Sphere 1 was a product of Sphere Corporation, launched in 1975 by Mike Wise in Bountiful, Utah. It was an all-in-one integrated microcomputer based on the new Motorola 6800 platform. It was ahead of its time; it was also delayed, somewhat difficult to use and frequently flaky. Sphere Corp itself disappeared in 1977, and Sphere was soon a punchline, then a footnote. &lt;lb/&gt;The Sphere computer may have been at its heart a hobbyist's machine, but its design and capabilities prefigured the mass-market computers that would become ubiquitous just a few years later. &lt;lb/&gt;More Sphere history....&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About this project&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;I'm Ben Zotto, a research historian, engineer, and writer from California. I'm assembling the story of Sphere-- a unique computer, and the unique company who built it and the people who used it. In addition to maintaining this site, I've written a book that will document thousands of hours of research; check it out!.&lt;lb/&gt;As part of this project, I've built a virtual web emulator for the standard Sphere configuration, including the first new game for the Sphere in 40+ years. ð¾ ð Try computing like it's 1975. I've also created the first new Sphere hardware since the 1970s.&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Do you have Sphere hardware, software, paperwork or stories?&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;I'd dearly love to hear from you. Sphere systems and kits were produced in small numbers; they were often unloved even in their time and are now quite obscure. Some material has been thankfully preserved, but there's plenty I haven't had the opportunity to study and archive. If you're looking to get your old Sphere stuff to a good home, have some unseen material in a closet, or have stories of working with or for these computers, let's talk. &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;a loss plateau that looked like my mistake turned out to be a PyTorch bug. tracking it down meant peeling back every layer of abstraction, from optimizer internals to GPU kernels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Expected to fix: my hyperparameters. Actually had to fix: PyTorch backend.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My training loss plateaued and wouldn’t budge. Obviously I’d screwed something up. I tried every hyperparameter combination, rewrote my loss function, spent days assuming I’d made some stupid mistake. Because it’s always user error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, it wasn’t. It was a niche PyTorch bug that forced me through layers of abstraction I normally never think about: optimizer internals, memory layouts, dispatch systems, kernel implementations. Taught me more about the framework than years of using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a surprisingly fun time with this bug hunt and wrote up the whole investigation step-by-step, explaining framework internals as they become necessary to crack the case. If you enjoy debugging mysteries or find that tracking down bugs teaches you more than docs ever could, this might resonate. 🕵️♀️&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debugging post-mortems sometimes make me worry I wouldn’t have been smart enough to figure them out myself. So I structured this walkthrough to show the reasoning behind each step: what clues suggested each move, why I tested that hypothesis, why certain results pointed where they did. While the investigation took time and persistence, it didn’t require any particular expertise or wizardry— just observation and willingness to keep digging. I’ve included background knowledge exactly when you need it to understand the next step—think of it as an excuse to learn (or re-learn) PyTorch internals through a real problem. If you’d prefer to jump straight to reproducing the bug yourself, check out the minimal reproduction script and walkthrough on GitHub. Otherwise, join me on the investigation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of Contents: 🤔 The Mystery: A Plateauing Loss…… 🔎 Isolating the Problem…… 💻 Device-Specific Differences…… ⌺ Tensor Memory Layouts…… 💔 Identifying the Broken Operations……. 🍎 Inside the Kernel Implementation…… 🕵️♀️ Case Closed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bug: A PyTorch GPU kernel bug silently failed when writing to non-contiguous memory, causing my model’s encoder weights to freeze during training on Apple Silicon (MPS backend, PyTorch &amp;lt;2.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Technical Details: PyTorch’s MPS (Apple Silicon GPU) backend had a kernel bug where &lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;addcdiv_&lt;/code&gt; operations silently fail when writing to non-contiguous output tensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why It Caused the Training Plateau:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exp_avg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; became non-contiguous)&lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;addcdiv_&lt;/code&gt; don’t handle non-contiguous outputs correctly&lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq.addcmul_()&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t update → value stays zero, then the parameter update via &lt;code&gt;addcdiv_&lt;/code&gt; also fails → complete silent freeze&lt;p&gt;The Fix:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;addcdiv_&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;p&gt;Current Status: Random operations (&lt;code&gt;normal_&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uniform_&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) still have this bug on macOS &amp;lt; 15 as of PyTorch 2.10 (I submitted a PR to fix this). Other MPS operations may be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reproduction: A minimal reproduction script &amp;amp; walkthrough is available at https://github.com/ElanaPearl/pytorch-mps-noncontiguous-bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training loss plateaued way too early. This felt like a standard hyperparameter issue- but I’d trained this same architecture on similar data with similar hyperparameters countless times and hit much lower losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What had changed? Those runs were months old. I tried reproducing them exactly, but couldn’t pin down the exact environment—the codebase had evolved through multiple projects, refactors, and dependency updates. Without a clean “before vs after,” I had to debug forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architecture itself is straightforward: a two-layer sparse autoencoder (encoder –&amp;gt; sparse hidden layer –&amp;gt; decoder). However, it has some training quirks the could be potential culprits: the hidden layer uses TopK sparsity, where only the k largest activations remain (others are zeroed); the training process includes some manual gradient adjustments (gradient clipping for stability and modifications to decoder weight gradients); there’s an auxiliary loss term to encourage feature activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I thought my initial hyperparameters were already well-tested, I tried everything: varied learning rates, tested different schedules, tried different k values and hidden dimensions, adjusted the auxiliary loss coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my actual research sat on hold while I was stuck second-guessing everything: was my code broken? My data corrupted? And the creeping doubt- I’ve been doing ML for years, why can’t I make a simple two-layer autoencoder train properly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model was small enough that I was training on my MacBook (using the Apple Silicon GPU) and simple enough I could actually inspect every parameter. So after the standard checks turned up nothing, I started looking at the weights directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visualized the weights at initialization and after the first few training steps. The decoder weights were updating- values shifting, gradients being applied, nothing crazy. But the encoder weights… weren’t updating at all. No NaNs, no suspicious patterns… they just… weren’t changing. They stayed exactly at their initialized values, down to the last decimal place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both layers participate in the same forward and backward pass. Why would one update and the other freeze completely?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First check: are gradients even making it back to the encoder? The TopK sparsity should make gradients sparse—only the k activated features get gradients through backprop, the rest are zeroed. But maybe I messed up the implementation so that no encoder gradients flow at all? Or the manual gradient adjustments I was making somehow blocked everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After &lt;code&gt;loss.backward()&lt;/code&gt;, the gradient statistics were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Encoder&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Decoder&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Max Grad&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2.35e6&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;6.64e6&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Sparsity&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;88.5% zeros&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;88.5% zeros&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The encoder gradients were there- and they were pretty big (as intended for my dataset)! And they were sparse (majority zeros) which was also expected, but there were still plenty of non-zero gradients. So gradients are definitely being calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the gradients exist but weights aren’t updating, the optimizer must be doing something wrong. Testing with a simpler optimizer, stochastic gradient descent (SGD):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Manual SGD update
with torch.no_grad():
    model.encoder.weight -= 0.001 * model.encoder.weight.grad
# Encoder weights change! ✓

# Torch SGD update
sgd_optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
sgd_optimizer.step()
# Encoder weights change! ✓

# But with Adam...
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
optimizer.step()
# Encoder weights don't change! ✗
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what might be breaking, I need to understand what Adam actually does differently from simple gradient descent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGD updates all parameters the same way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# SGD: one learning rate for everything
param = param - learning_rate * gradient
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has a few problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different parameters need different learning rates. Some parameters might consistently get gradients around 1000 while others get 0.01. With SGD’s fixed learning rate, you’re stuck: either you move too slowly on small gradients or you overshoot wildly on large ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The learning rate needs to change over time. Early in training, you want big steps to explore the space. Later, you need tiny steps to settle into a minimum. SGD requires manually decaying the learning rate on a schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam maintains two pieces of state per parameter and uses two hyperparameters to control how these states evolve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State variables (initialized to zero for each parameter):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exp_avg&lt;/code&gt;: Running average of gradients (first moment)&lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt;: Running average of squared gradients (second moment)&lt;p&gt;Hyperparameters (typically beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;beta_1&lt;/code&gt;: Decay rate for first moment (momentum)&lt;code&gt;beta_2&lt;/code&gt;: Decay rate for second moment (gradient magnitude history)&lt;p&gt;Here’s the simplified algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initialize state (done once per parameter)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exp_avg = zeros_like(param)
exp_avg_sq = zeros_like(param)
step = 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each training step:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Update moments with exponential moving averages
exp_avg = beta_1 * exp_avg + (1 - beta_1) * grad
exp_avg_sq = beta_2 * exp_avg_sq + (1 - beta_2) * grad**2

# Update step count
# (It effectively starts at 1 to avoid division by zero in bias correction)
step += 1

# Bias correction
exp_avg_corrected = exp_avg / (1 - beta_1**step)
exp_avg_sq_corrected = exp_avg_sq / (1 - beta_2**step)

# Adaptive parameter update
param = param - lr * exp_avg_corrected / (sqrt(exp_avg_sq_corrected) + ε)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Each Moment Does:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First moment (&lt;code&gt;exp_avg&lt;/code&gt;): Smooths out noisy gradients by averaging recent directions—like momentum in physics. When gradients oscillate (+10, -10, +8, -9…), the positive and negative values cancel out, revealing there’s no consistent direction. Beta_1=0.9 means “keep 90% of old momentum, add 10% of new gradient.” This smoothed momentum is what gets multiplied by the learning rate in the parameter update: &lt;code&gt;lr * exp_avg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second moment (&lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt;): Tracks typical gradient magnitude for each parameter by averaging squared gradients. Squaring removes the +/- sign (both +10 and -10 become 100), preventing cancellation. Beta_2=0.999 means “keep 99.9% of magnitude history, add 0.1% of new squared gradient.” This magnitude normalizes the momentum-based update: &lt;code&gt;lr * exp_avg / sqrt(exp_avg_sq)&lt;/code&gt;. Parameters with consistently large gradients get their updates scaled down (large denominator), while parameters with small gradients get boosted (small denominator). This is how Adam achieves adaptive per-parameter learning rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epsilon (&lt;code&gt;ε=1e-8&lt;/code&gt;): Prevents division by zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bias Correction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both moments start at zero, causing early estimates to be biased toward zero. The correction factor &lt;code&gt;(1 - β**step)&lt;/code&gt; provides a large boost early to counteract this, effectively “warming up” the optimizer over the first ~1000-3000 steps. As training progresses, the correction approaches 1 and has negligible effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second moment works similarly. Without correction, &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; would be only 0.1% of gradient² at step 1, but bias correction restores it to the full value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a deeper dive into Adam’s design and intuition, as well as other optimizers that use momentum and adaptive learning rates (RMSprop, AdaGrad, etc.), check out Stanford’s CS231n notes on optimization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what Adam should be doing, let’s look at the state it’s maintaining (those &lt;code&gt;exp_avg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; tensors that track momentum and variance) to see what it’s actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our frozen encoder, the maximum values in each state tensor were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Encoder&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Decoder&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;exp_avg&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1.96e+05&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1.70e+06&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1.18e+11&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, WHAT?! The encoder’s &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; is zero despite having momentum accumulated in &lt;code&gt;exp_avg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feels mathematically impossible… The second moment (&lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt;) is zero despite non-zero gradients. Since &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; stores squared gradients, it should NEVER be zero if gradients are non-zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if it truly were zero, we’d see massive weight updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;param_update = lr * exp_avg / (sqrt(exp_avg_sq) + ε) 
             = 0.001 * 1.96e5 / (sqrt(0) + 1e-8)
             = 196 / 1e-8
             = 1.96e10  # &amp;lt;-- HUGE!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be huge! Yet we see NO updates… this paradox points to a deeper issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam uses bias correction to counteract zero initialization. Having previously encountered subtle training issues due to Adam bias initialization bugs, I wondered if the correction might be broken here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recall, the bias correction is simply making our effective beta values dependent on the step index, so if the issue has to do with bias correction, it might have some relation to our beta parameters or step index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tested with different beta values, at different steps, and even beta_2=0 (which bypasses the exponential average entirely, making &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq = grad**2&lt;/code&gt; directly). The encoder’s &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; still stayed zero, making bias correction seem less likely as a culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;code&gt;exp_avg&lt;/code&gt; updated correctly despite using the same bias correction mechanism. So maybe something else is preventing &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; from updating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My largest gradients were big (1e6), and squared that’s 1e12. While that is quite large, it shouldn’t overflow in float32. However, I’ve also been hurt by precision bugs before&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved everything to float64… AND IT STARTED WORKING!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few more minutes of spiraling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing with float32 on CPU… the weights update!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;device-specific&lt;/code&gt;! The exact same float32 code updates weights on CPU but fails on MPS. This was progress: same code, same datatypes, but different devices meant different implementations—and different bugs. &lt;p&gt;﹡ This is progress!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;﹡ Note to self… simpler explanations are more likely correct- even (and especially!) when LLMs confidently assert complicated theories that are hard to understand / verify&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;﹡ Now I just need to figure out why the bug only occurs with MPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyTorch’s device abstraction lets you write the same code and run it on CPUs, GPUs, and even Apple Silicon. It feels like the same computation is running everywhere — but under the hood, each device has its own entirely separate implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you call a tensor operation like &lt;code&gt;matmul&lt;/code&gt;, PyTorch looks at the tensor’s metadata (e.g. device, dtype, shape) and dispatches to a specialized kernel: a device-specific, highly optimized implementation tailored for that particular hardware backend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple’s GPU Stack:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On “Kernel” Terminology:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, “kernel” refers to low-level GPU code that runs directly on hardware: functions that explicitly manage parallelism across thousands of GPU cores, handle device memory allocation, and are written in chip-specific languages like CUDA or Metal Shading Language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, PyTorch seems to also use “kernel” to describe a higher-level abstraction: the framework’s implementation code (C++, Objective-C++, or CUDA files in the &lt;code&gt;native/&lt;/code&gt; directory) that handles specific operations for specific backends. These PyTorch kernels sit above the hardware level- they might call optimized libraries like MPS or cuDNN (which then use those low-level GPU kernels underneath), or they might contain hand-written GPU code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, we end up primarily exploring PyTorch kernels (e.g. the C++/Objective-C++ code in &lt;code&gt;BinaryOps.mm&lt;/code&gt; that orchestrates MPS operations) rather than the Metal compute shaders executing on GPU cores beneath them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was surprised these higher-level implementations are also called “kernels” and maybe I have just confused my terminology here but I didn’t have a better name for them so I tried to mostly use “PyTorch kernel” or just “operation” to describe them, though the terminology does get blurry in places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when you write something like &lt;code&gt;result = tensor_a @ tensor_b&lt;/code&gt;, you’re not invoking a universal multiply function. PyTorch uses the tensors’ metadata to select a device- and dtype-specific kernel that performs the actual computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplying two tensors on the CPU uses a completely different kernel than on MPS or CUDA. Even on the same device, changing the dtype or layout can trigger a different kernel. PyTorch maintains a large set of these implementations to support all the combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll see exactly how this dispatch system works in C++ later when we dive into the source code. For now, the important point is: even with identical Python code different tensor metadata → different kernel code → different efficiency / bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my case, because I’m running this on my M3 MacBook Pro, I’ m using MPS (Metal Performance Shaders), which is the GPU backend for Apple Silicon. While it feels a bit crazy to assume that my training plateau is due to an internal kernel-level bug, it’s a bit less unreasonable with MPS as it’s newer and less mature than the CPU and CUDA backends. (And honestly, most people training/debugging ML models are not doing it on their MacBooks.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adam bug appears when working with the encoder on MPS. What makes the encoder different from the decoder that would trigger different behavior?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tested everything I could think of that might differentiate the two tensors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing helped. Even when both tensors had similar gradient statistics, only the encoder’s &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; stayed frozen. The difference wasn’t in the values of the tensor - something else about the encoder tensor itself was triggering the bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What properties does a PyTorch tensor even have? I asked Claude what attributes could differ between two tensors and checked them one-by-one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Encoder&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Decoder&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Same?&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Device&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;mps:0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;mps:0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;✓&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Dtype&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;float32&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;float32&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;✓&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Shape&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[1536, 384]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[384, 1536]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Requires_grad&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;True&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;True&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;✓&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Stride&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(1, 1536)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(1536, 1)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Contiguous&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;False&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;True&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three differences! The encoder and decoder have different shapes (they’re transposes of each other)&lt;code&gt;nn.Linear&lt;/code&gt; stores weights as [out_features, in_features], so the encoder (384→1536) has shape [1536, 384] and the decoder (1536→384) has shape [384, 1536].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shape difference itself can’t cause different behavior (PyTorch operations handle any shape). But contiguity? That’s a low-level memory detail that could be relevant. Maybe the MPS Adam bug only affects non-contiguous tensors? Worth a shot:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;model.encoder.weight.data = model.encoder.weight.contiguous()

# Encoder updates!! ✓
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT WORKS! But why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your computer’s memory is just a flat, 1D array of bytes, but tensors represent multi-dimensional grids. When you index &lt;code&gt;tensor[i, j]&lt;/code&gt;, PyTorch needs to find that element in the flat memory. The tensor’s stride tells it how to do this conversion (and the exact amount you jump between elements depends on the dtype and how much memory each element takes up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of stride as navigation instructions: “to get from one row to the next, skip this many elements.” By default, memory is stored row-wise—each row is stored sequentially, then the next row comes after. If you read through a row, you skip over 1 element at a time; to go to the next row, you move row-length elements over. (This is why going across a row is faster than going down a column.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the memory layout doesn’t have to match the logical layout we use to think about the tensor. We can change how the user views the tensor without moving any data! For example, when we run transpose (&lt;code&gt;.T&lt;/code&gt;), we don’t need to move around any data—we just change the stride!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we see in the images, reading all the elements row-by-row in the contiguous tensor is easy and linear, but the same row-wise pattern in the non-contiguous tensor is much jumpier. This jumping pattern makes the tensor “non-contiguous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s only one way for a tensor to be contiguous (the “natural” layout), there are many ways to become non-contiguous. By default, tensors are initialized as contiguous, but operations like slicing (&lt;code&gt;tensor[::2, :]&lt;/code&gt;), reshaping, and dimension reordering (&lt;code&gt;permute&lt;/code&gt;) can all create different non-contiguous stride patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why design tensors this way? Wouldn’t it be simpler to always keep data in the “natural” contiguous layout? The answer is performance: by just adjusting the tensor’s metadata, operations like transpose, slice, and reshape can be nearly instant— no data movement or memory allocation required. Keeping everything contiguous would mean expensive copying every time you reorganize dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the weight initialization code:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;self.encoder.weight.data = self.decoder.weight.T.clone()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.T&lt;/code&gt; creates a non-contiguous view, and &lt;code&gt;.clone()&lt;/code&gt; preserves the stride pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.clone()&lt;/code&gt; preserve stride patterns?&lt;p&gt;At first this felt counterintuitive to me- if we’re already paying the cost to copy the data (the whole point of non-contiguous layouts is to avoid copying), why not copy it into the “better” contiguous layout?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this actually makes sense from a design perspective: &lt;code&gt;.clone()&lt;/code&gt; should create an exact copy with all properties preserved, including memory layout. The tensor might be non-contiguous for a reason—maybe you’re about to transpose it back, or the layout is optimized for some operation. Silently reorganizing memory would be surprising behavior. (The optional &lt;code&gt;torch.memory_format&lt;/code&gt; argument, which defaults to &lt;code&gt;torch.preserve_format&lt;/code&gt;, makes this choice explicit.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, preserving the layout is also faster. Even though both include new memory allocation and moving data, reorganizing it still slows things down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;x_t = x.T  # Start with non-contiguous
y_noncontig = x_t.clone()              # Preserves non-contiguous (1.919ms)
y_contig = x_t.clone(memory_format=torch.contiguous_format)  # Force contiguous (4.401ms)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so we now know this initialization is why only the encoder is non-contiguous, and thus why only the encoder has training issues!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I could just call &lt;code&gt;.contiguous()&lt;/code&gt; on my encoder, declare victory, and get back to the research this bug was blocking me from doing… I felt like I was just scratching the surface of this bug and I feared it would haunt me until I fully figured out WHAT happened and WHY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Adam updates parameters, what operations does it perform? Let’s look at PyTorch’s Adam implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fair warning: this file is over 1000 lines! To find what we need, search for where &lt;code&gt;exp_avg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; are defined and updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the critical lines (lines 101, 391-407):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# State initialization (line 101)
state["exp_avg"] = torch.zeros_like(param, memory_format=torch.preserve_format)
state["exp_avg_sq"] = torch.zeros_like(param, memory_format=torch.preserve_format)

# ... [300 lines of setup and parameter group handling] ...

# First moment update (line 391)
exp_avg.lerp_(grad, 1 - beta1)

# Second moment update (line 392)
exp_avg_sq.mul_(beta2).addcmul_(grad, grad, value=1 - beta2)

# ... [bias correction calculations] ...

# Parameter update (line 407)
param.addcdiv_(exp_avg, denom, value=-step_size)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at that initialization! &lt;code&gt;memory_format=torch.preserve_format&lt;/code&gt; means the state tensors inherit their stride pattern from &lt;code&gt;param&lt;/code&gt;. So when our encoder weight is non-contiguous, both &lt;code&gt;exp_avg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; are also non-contiguous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they’re BOTH non-contiguous - so why does only one break?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, while they both are computed via addition and multiplication, they don’t use the exact same operations to perform this. Any of these operations could be a suspect, so let’s test each one individually!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For operations like &lt;code&gt;output.addcmul_(input1, input2)&lt;/code&gt;, the output tensor&lt;code&gt;mul_&lt;/code&gt;), that indicates that it is performing an in-place operation to modify a tensor directly in memory. Just as different devices can distinct kernels, so can distinctions like these!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing each Adam operation with non-contiguous output tensors on MPS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Operation&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Function&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Result&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Linear interpolation&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;lerp_()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Updates ✓&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Scalar multiply&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;mul_()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Updates ✓&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Add + multiply&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;addcmul_()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Stays zero ✗&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Add + divide&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;addcdiv_()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Stays zero ✗&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;code&gt;addcmul_()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;addcdiv_()&lt;/code&gt; both fail silently when writing to non-contiguous outputs on MPS. &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, input contiguity doesn’t matter, only the output! Whether &lt;code&gt;grad&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exp_avg&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;denom&lt;/code&gt; are contiguous makes no difference. The bug is purely in how these kernels write to non-contiguous output buffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broken operations aren’t producing zeros or NaNs. They’re simply not modifying the output tensor at all. This wasn’t immediately obvious since &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; was initialized to zeros, making “stays at zero” and “never updates” look identical. But testing with a non-zero, non-contiguous output tensor confirms that after calling &lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;addcdiv_&lt;/code&gt;, the values remain unchanged. No update happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet timing shows MPS is doing substantial work. Non-contiguous operations take &amp;gt;2x longer than contiguous ones, proving the kernels are computing something, yet those results never make it to the output tensor. On CPU, each of these operations work correctly regardless of memory layout. This is purely a MPS-specific bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the broken operations identified, we can trace the complete chain of events that triggers our failure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Initialization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Creates non-contiguous encoder weight (stride: 1, 1536)
encoder.weight = decoder.weight.T.clone()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Adam State Creation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Both state tensors inherit non-contiguous layout from param
state["exp_avg"] = zeros_like(param, memory_format=torch.preserve_format)
state["exp_avg_sq"] = zeros_like(param, memory_format=torch.preserve_format)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Optimization Loop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First moment update:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exp_avg.lerp_(grad, 1-beta_1)  # ✓ Works fine
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second moment update:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq.mul_(beta_2)                        # ✓ Works fine
exp_avg_sq.addcmul_(grad, grad, 1-beta_2)      # ✗ No update - stays zero!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Parameter Update&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Should update param, does nothing, leading to silent failure
param.addcdiv_(exp_avg, denom, value=-step_size)  # ✗ No update!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq.addcmul_()&lt;/code&gt; failed, the zero &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; would produce massive weight explosions (update = &lt;code&gt;lr × exp_avg / √(ε)&lt;/code&gt;), making the bug immediately obvious. But &lt;code&gt;param.addcdiv_()&lt;/code&gt; also failed, producing no updates at all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second bug masked the first, creating a silent failure: the spookiest type of error. The model appeared to be learning (the decoder was training normally), but progress stalled because the encoder stayed frozen. A subtle plateau that looked exactly like a hyperparameter issue 🙃&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If non-contiguous tensors can cause operations to silently fail on MPS, why didn’t the forward pass or backward pass break?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forward and backward passes for &lt;code&gt;F.linear&lt;/code&gt; use &lt;code&gt;matmul&lt;/code&gt; for their matrix multiplications, which handle non-contiguous tensors correctly on MPS. Testing confirms that both &lt;code&gt;matmul&lt;/code&gt; (the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; operator) and &lt;code&gt;F.linear&lt;/code&gt; work correctly with non-contiguous input tensors and non-contiguous weight matrices on MPS, including during the backward pass where gradients flow through non-contiguous weights without issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bug is specific to the fused in-place operations that Adam uses for state updates: &lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;addcdiv_&lt;/code&gt;. These operations fail silently when writing to non-contiguous output tensors, while other in-place operations like &lt;code&gt;lerp_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mul_&lt;/code&gt; work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we have made so much progress on this case, we’re still not done yet!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;addcdiv_&lt;/code&gt; fail to update non-contiguous outputs while &lt;code&gt;mul_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lerp_&lt;/code&gt; work fine? &lt;p&gt;To understand why some operations work and others don’t, I needed to look at PyTorch’s source code for the buggy kernels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I normally trace through a Python codebase by jumping to definitions in my IDE, that doesn’t work with &lt;code&gt;tensor.addcmul_()&lt;/code&gt;. When you call this function, there’s no Python source code executing - instead, Python immediately jumps into compiled C++ code for performance. And since PyTorch ships this as a pre-compiled binary, I can’t see that C++ implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can a Python tensor object have methods that execute C++ code? I skipped over this earlier but even though I know PyTorch isn’t the only framework to do this and everything is just machine code if you zoom in close enough… it still feels a bit magical to casually call another language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explanation is Python bindings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you install PyTorch, you’re not just getting Python files. You’re also getting compiled C++ libraries (.so files on Linux/Mac, .dll on Windows) that contain the actual mathematical operations. The Python part is essentially a wrapper that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tensor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;other_tensor&lt;/code&gt;, etc.)&lt;p&gt;PyTorch uses pybind11 to automatically generate this wrapper code. For example, the C++ function signature:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tensor&amp;amp; addcmul_(Tensor&amp;amp; self, const Tensor&amp;amp; tensor1, const Tensor&amp;amp; tensor2, const Scalar&amp;amp; value)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gets automatically wrapped so you can call it from Python as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tensor.addcmul_(tensor1, tensor2, value=1.0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why PyTorch operations are fast despite being called from Python - the heavy lifting happens in optimized C++ code, with Python just handling the interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as we discussed earlier, PyTorch dispatches based on tensor metadata, so there isn’t just one implementation - there are device-specific kernels for CPU, CUDA, MPS, etc. Since my PyTorch installation just has the compiled binary files, to investigate the actual implementations, we need to clone PyTorch’s repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All kernels are listed in an operation registry - a YAML file that maps operation names (like &lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt;) to their tensor-specific C++ implementations. In practice, when PyTorch is compiled (normally done before you install it), this registry is used to automatically generate hundreds of scripts that do the actual dispatching based on the patterns described here, but if we just want to understand what kernel our tensor is calling, we can look through the registry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching for “addcmul_” in the registry &lt;code&gt;native_functions.yaml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- func: addcmul_(Tensor(a!) self, Tensor tensor1, Tensor tensor2, *, Scalar value=1) -&amp;gt; Tensor(a!)
  # our addcmul_ function just points us to the yaml for addcmul.out
  structured_delegate: addcmul.out

# The function addcmul_ points to:
- func: addcmul.out(...)
  dispatch:
    CPU, CUDA: addcmul_out
    MPS: addcmul_out_mps  # Different function for MPS!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the device-specific operation names, we can search them in the PyTorch repo within the mps implementations, and we find our implementation for &lt;code&gt;addcmul_out_mps&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;PointwiseOps.mm&lt;/code&gt;. Upon a first skim of the code, I realized I had no clue how to read the MPS codebase. There were too many unknown variables and constructs, and I wasn’t sure what to look for in this implementation. I’d written a CUDA kernel before, and was pretty good with C about a decade ago, but as turns out, neither of those helped here :(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to decode unfamiliar code in isolation, I’d find something similar that works correctly and compare the two. &lt;code&gt;mul_&lt;/code&gt; was the perfect comparison since both are simple element-wise in-place operations. The registry pointed me to &lt;code&gt;binaryOpTensor&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;BinaryOps.mm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I had my comparison:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;addc_mul_div_out_mps&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;PointwiseOps.mm&lt;/code&gt; (used by &lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;code&gt;binaryOpTensor&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;BinaryOps.mm&lt;/code&gt; (used by &lt;code&gt;mul_&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;p&gt;I opened both side-by-side, scanning specifically for differences in how they handle the output tensor. My experiments had already narrowed the search: I knew both operations were computing something (timing proved that), so the bug had to be in how results get written back to non-contiguous outputs. Look for anything related to contiguity checks or special output handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broken version (&lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;static void addc_mul_div_out_mps(..., Tensor&amp;amp; output, ...) {
  // ... setup code ...
  Placeholder outputPlaceholder = Placeholder(output);
  runMPSGraph(...);
  // That's it - no additional handling
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working version (&lt;code&gt;mul_&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;static void binaryOpTensor(..., Tensor&amp;amp; output, ...) {
  // ... setup code ...
  
  bool needsCopyToOutput = !output.is_contiguous();
  if (needsCopyToOutput) {
    // Create temporary contiguous tensor
    output = at::empty(...);
  }
  
  Placeholder outputPlaceholder = Placeholder(output);
  runMPSGraph(...);
  
  if (needsCopyToOutput) {
    output_.copy_(output);  // Copy results back!
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The working version explicitly checks &lt;code&gt;!output.is_contiguous()&lt;/code&gt; and adds extra handling: it creates a temporary contiguous tensor, runs the operation, then copies results back. The broken version just passes the output directly to &lt;code&gt;Placeholder&lt;/code&gt; and calls it a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this raises a new question: if non-contiguous memory layouts need this kind of explicit handling, why doesn’t &lt;code&gt;addcmul&lt;/code&gt; just crash or throw an error instead of silently failing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in understanding what &lt;code&gt;Placeholder&lt;/code&gt; does. PyTorch tensors and Metal (Apple’s GPU framework) use different memory formats, so PyTorch needs a converter when running operations on Apple Silicon. &lt;code&gt;Placeholder&lt;/code&gt; handles this conversion - it takes PyTorch tensors and wraps them in Metal-compatible buffers, handles different data types, manages memory layouts, and sets up the compute pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most tensors, this conversion is straightforward. But for non-contiguous tensors, Metal can’t work with the scattered memory layout directly. Looking at the Placeholder code:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (!src.is_contiguous()) {
    _tensor = src.clone(MemoryFormat::Contiguous);  // Create contiguous copy
    srcBuf = getMTLBufferStorage(_tensor);          // Point Metal to the copy
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Placeholder encounters a non-contiguous tensor, it automatically creates a contiguous copy and points Metal to that copy instead. This happens transparently - the broken kernels have no idea they’re working with a temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This automatic copying is perfect for input tensors - Metal reads from the copy, computation proceeds normally, and nobody cares what happens to the temporary afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s disastrous for output tensors where the goal is in-place editing. The computation succeeds and writes results to the temporary copy, but those results never make it back to the original tensor that’s supposed to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If non-contiguous tensors are so problematic, why do CPU and CUDA backends handle them fine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPU: Can handle arbitrary strides natively. When iterating through a non-contiguous tensor, the CPU just follows the stride pattern—jumping around memory is slower than sequential access, but it works correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CUDA: NVIDIA’s CUDA framework has always supported strided memory access in kernels. Operations can read/write to non-contiguous layouts directly, though with some performance penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPS: Apple’s Metal Performance Shaders framework initially didn’t support strided access. Kernels expected contiguous memory layouts, period. This forced PyTorch to implement the gather-scatter workaround pattern we saw in the working kernels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bug occurred because some MPS operations implemented this workaround (like &lt;code&gt;mul_&lt;/code&gt;), while others didn’t (like &lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt;). The abstraction (Placeholder) that was supposed to hide this complexity actually made it worse by silently copying outputs without a way to copy results back. Although as we’ll learn later this has been improved in newer Mac Operating Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broken kernels work perfectly with contiguous tensors and silently fail with non-contiguous ones. The working kernels detect this situation and add an explicit copy-back step to move results from the temporary to the original tensor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the bug made the solution clear - apply the same pattern that working kernels use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tested this locally and it worked! The encoder weights finally updated and the model trained successfully 🎉🎉&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the complete reproduction, debugging experiments, fix at https://github.com/ElanaPearl/pytorch-mps-noncontiguous-bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While editing a Python package just involves installing your locally editable version of the code instead of the default package, to test my PyTorch fix, I had to re-build it all locally, which was more work than expected and also made me acutely aware that this whole time I was working on PyTorch v2.2.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checking the latest version revealed the bug was already fixed in v2.4, patched by an ML engineer at Apple last year using almost the exact same approach I’d used.&lt;code&gt;arrayView&lt;/code&gt; API (see WWDC 2024 session at timestamp 13:41). Instead of the gather-scatter workaround, Metal can now read/write directly from non-contiguous memory using stride metadata. This means on macOS 15+, PyTorch can skip the manual copy workarounds entirely. The performance gap between contiguous and non-contiguous tensors is now much smaller, though contiguous is still faster due to better cache utilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;the story wasn't over just yet!&lt;/code&gt; &lt;p&gt;While writing this up, I added some more tests for my kernel fix to confirm it really worked, and one of the tests failed! I looked into it more and realized I’d stumbled upon the same failure pattern in the &lt;code&gt;random_&lt;/code&gt; operation (in the most up-to-date PyTorch this time!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, all random in-place operations (&lt;code&gt;normal_&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uniform_&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exponential_&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;random_&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bernoulli_&lt;/code&gt;) silently fail when called on non-contiguous tensors on MPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;x = torch.zeros(10, 10).T  # Non-contiguous
x.normal_()  # Should fill with random values
print(x.max())  # Prints 0.0 - the operation silently failed!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet again, the operations complete without error, but the tensor remains unchanged—the kernel computes random values into a temporary contiguous buffer but never copies them back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having just traced through this exact bug pattern, I recognized it immediately and knew exactly how to fix it. Filed an Issue and made a PR applying the same solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect there are other similar bugs lying around, as none of these fixes actually address the underlying quirk that the Placeholder abstraction itself is problematic when used with output tensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core issue: Placeholder’s constructor silently creates a temporary contiguous copy for non-contiguous tensors, but it has no way to know if it’s wrapping an input (where the copy is fine- we just read from it) or an output (where the copy is broken- results get written to it then lost). This means every single operation that uses Placeholder for outputs must manually implement the same workaround pattern or else it has this silent failure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Every MPS operation must remember to do this:
bool needsCopy = !output.is_contiguous();
Tensor temp = needsCopy ? at::empty(...) : output;
@autoreleasepool {
    Placeholder p(temp);
    runGraph();
}
if (needsCopy)
  output.copy_(temp);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a leaky abstraction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: macOS 15+ Metal now handles non-contiguous tensors natively, making this entire issue obsolete for newer systems. But for anyone on older macOS versions or maintaining PyTorch’s MPS backend, this abstraction continues to cause issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So ideally, the Placeholder class would be redesigned to handle output tensors correctly by default, but given that the hardware is moving to handle this natively anyway, the pragmatic fix is probably just to audit and patch the remaining operations using the established pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance Considerations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the code fixes, non-contiguous tensors on MPS involve: Allocate temporary buffer -&amp;gt; Copy to contiguous layout -&amp;gt; Compute -&amp;gt; Copy back. Making tensors contiguous once at initialization avoids thousands of copies during training! And even if your OS can avoid making this temporary contiguous copy, it is still slower to operate on non-contiguous memory if you will be using it many times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When to Call &lt;code&gt;.contiguous()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# When to call .contiguous() - General Principles

# 1. After operations that change memory layout:
x = tensor.transpose(0, 1)  # Non-contiguous
x = tensor.view(-1)          # Might fail if non-contiguous!
x = x.contiguous().view(-1)  # Safe

# 2. Before operations that might not handle strides:
# - Custom CUDA/Metal kernels  
# - Newer backend features
# - Operations that failed mysteriously on certain devices

# 3. For performance on repeated operations:
weights = init_weights().T   # Used in every forward pass
weights = weights.contiguous()  # Pay copy cost once, not every iteration

# But don't overuse it!
x = x + y  # Creates new contiguous tensor anyway
x = x.contiguous()  # Unnecessary copy!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;For MPS specifically: If on macOS &amp;lt;15, make sure all your parameters are contiguous!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolate to specific, measurable symptoms. The most standard advice and for such good reason. Everything got easier once I had a concrete target: “&lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; stays at zero” is infinitely more debuggable than “the loss plateaus mysteriously.” Once I had a specific symptom, I could strip away components and test the minimal case that triggered it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When debugging tensor issues, check metadata not just values. I was checking for NaNs, visualizing weights, inspecting gradients—all focused on the numbers inside tensors. The actual problem was the tensor’s stride pattern. Device, dtype, contiguity, memory layout—these aren’t just performance details, they can cause silent correctness bugs. &lt;code&gt;tensor.is_contiguous()&lt;/code&gt; is now part of my debugging checklist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I’m confused, I might have changed two things—or there might be two bugs. Switching to fp64 “fixed” it, but I’d also switched from MPS to CPU. Untangling that revealed the real culprit. And &lt;code&gt;exp_avg_sq&lt;/code&gt; staying zero should have caused explosions, but the parameter update also failed—one bug perfectly masked the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documentation makes more sense when I need it. I’d skimmed PyTorch internals docs before and nothing stuck—dispatch systems, stride patterns, kernel implementations all felt overwhelming. But once I had to understand how &lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt; dispatches to MPS kernels, everything clicked. Now PyTorch feels less like a black box. And when I hit the random ops bug weeks later, I wasn’t intimidated—I knew exactly how to trace through the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explore the system before exploring the code. When I needed to debug &lt;code&gt;addcmul_out_mps&lt;/code&gt; in unfamiliar MPS code, I ran experiments first: which operations fail? Do they run at all? What triggers the bug? By the time I opened the source, I knew to compare &lt;code&gt;addcmul_&lt;/code&gt; (broken) against &lt;code&gt;mul_&lt;/code&gt; (working) and scan specifically for differences in output handling. Without that context, I’d have been lost in Objective-C++ with no idea what mattered. Also LLMs were very helpful with unfamiliar constructs like &lt;code&gt;MPSGraphTensor&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@autoreleasepool&lt;/code&gt;, although they’re still less reliable with MPS than more documented frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write post-mortems– even for yourself. Forcing myself to explain why I tried each debugging step was as educational as the original investigation. It’s like experience replay in RL: you explore many failed paths, find one that works, then replay that successful trajectory to reinforce the policy. Writing it down builds pattern recognition—when I’m in “situation A”, what hypotheses are worth trying? I’ve written lower-effort debugging debriefs before, but making this one readable for an external audience forced me to articulate why each step made sense, deepening my understanding of what actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What started as a frustrating research roadblock became a surprisingly fun &amp;amp; educational detour. It forced a closer look at things normally taken for granted: Adam’s momentum mechanics, stride patterns, kernel dispatch. Understanding why each operation behaved differently revealed more about PyTorch’s architecture than typical usage ever does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, thanks for joining! Hope you had fun and/or learned something &amp;amp; happy debugging!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Nicholas Joseph, Ben Kuhn, Nelson Elhage and Alex Tamkin for giving feedback on this 💜&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Pico-Banana-400K is a large-scale dataset of ~400K text–image–edit triplets designed to advance research in text-guided image editing.&lt;lb/&gt; Each example contains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;an original image (from Open Images),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a human-like edit instruction, and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the edited result generated by Nano-Banana and verified by Gemini-2.5-Pro.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dataset spans 35 edit operations across 8 semantic categories, covering diverse transformations—from low-level color adjustments to high-level object, scene, and stylistic edits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Feature&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Total Samples&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~257K single-turn text–image–edit triplets for SFT, ~56K single-turn text-image(positive) - image(negative)-edit for preference learning, and ~72K multi-turn texts-images-edits for multi-turn applications&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Open Images&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Categories&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Pixel &amp;amp; Photometric, Object-Level, Scene Composition, Stylistic, Text &amp;amp; Symbol, Human-Centric, Scale &amp;amp; Perspective, Spatial/Layout&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Self-Evaluation&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pico-Banana-400K is built using a two-stage multimodal generation pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instruction Generation&lt;lb/&gt;Each Open Images sample is passed to Gemini-2.5-Flash, which writes concise, natural-language editing instructions grounded in visible content. We also provide short instructions summarized by Qwen-2.5-Instruct-7B. Example:&lt;quote&gt;{ "instruction": "Change the red car to blue." }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Editing + Self-Evaluation The Nano-Banana model performs the edit, then automatically evaluates the result using a structured quality prompt that measures: Instruction Compliance (40%) Editing Realism (25%) Preservation Balance (20%) Technical Quality (15%) Only edits scoring above a strict threshold (~0.7) are labeled as successful, forming the main dataset; the remaining ~56K are retained as failure cases for robustness and preference learning.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nano-Banana-400K contains ~400K image editing data, covering a wide visual and semantic range drawn from real-world imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-Turn SFT samples (successful edits): ~257K&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-Turn Preference samples (failure cases): ~56K&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Turn SFT samples (successful cases): ~72K&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gemini-generated instructions: concise, natural, and image-aware&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edit coverage: 35 edit types across 8 semantic categories&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image diversity: includes humans, objects, text-rich scenes, etc from Open Images&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are representative examples from different categories:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Object-Level&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;“Replace the red apple with a green one.”&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Scene Composition&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;“Uppercase the text on the billboard.”&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Stylistic&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;“Convert the image to a Van Gogh painting style.”&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pico-Banana-400K provides both breadth (diverse edit operations) and depth (quality-controlled multimodal supervision), making it a strong foundation for training and evaluating text-guided image editing models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pico-Banana-400K serves as a versatile resource for advancing controllable and instruction-aware image editing.&lt;lb/&gt; Beyond single-step editing, the dataset enables multi-turn, conversational editing and reward-based training paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pico-Banana-400K dataset is hosted on Apple’s public CDN.&lt;lb/&gt; You can download each component (single-turn, multi-turn, and preference data) using the provided manifest files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manifest files: sft link and preference link&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manifest file: multi-turn link&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Urls to download source images are provided along with edit instructions in sft link, preference link, and multi-turn link. If you hit rate limit with Flickr when downloading images, you can either request higher rate limit with Flickr or follow steps below.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This monument popped up in the middle of Barking recently. I thought it was very recently but it was actually unveiled in April 2022 and I'm just not very observant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It says "In Memory of those who lost their lives because of exposure to asbestos".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it's here because Barking has one of the highest rates of asbestos-related deaths in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1913 the Cape Asbestos Company built a huge asbestos factory beside the River Roding in Barking. The company mined asbestos-bearing rock at several sites in South Africa, then shipped them in sacks to a private quay in Barking for processing. Hundreds of people were employed to mill the ore into usable fibres and then process these into lagging, packaging, pipes, resins, boards and all forms of insulation widely used in the building trade. They worked without masks or other protection, the dangers of asbestos either unknown or not thought worth bothering about. And hundreds of workers died, often many years later, of insidious chronic respiratory disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found a 32-page booklet published by Cape Asbestos in the days before blue asbestos was recognised as dangerous and banned, which was as late as 1985. It shows workers with rolled-up sleeves and women leaning over unshielded machines, all potentially inhaling enough fibres to ultimately kill them. I read reports about the local school in Barking, barely 100 metres away, saying that the playground was often covered in fine dust which children rolled up and played with as if it were snow. I read that mesothelioma was so common in the area it was known as the ‘Barking Cough’. These were different times, but times that linger on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cape Asbestos's plant eventually closed in 1968 and in its place was built the Harts Lane council estate, which is still not the loveliest corner of Barking. It included two tall tower blocks called Colne House and Mersey House, both of which Barking &amp;amp; Dagenham council would now like to demolish. This is chiefly because they're old and covered in combustible cladding, but the additional complications of potentially disturbing polluted land puts any remediation out of financial reach. It's always the insulation you have to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memorial in Barking Town Square comprises a polished chunk of blue pearl granite and was unveiled on Workers' Memorial Day 2022 in a ceremony attended by several trade unionists and representatives of the London Asbestos Support Awareness Group. The emphasis is partly on remembrance and partly on the importance of standing up for workers' rights to make conditions better for all. As the inscription says, "Remember the Dead and Fight for the Living".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My grandfather worked for another Cape Asbestos plant on Tolpits Lane in Watford. Originally it had been run by Universal Asbestos Manufacturing but in 1967 the factory was acquired by Cape as part of a diversification into cement-based products. They made corrugated roofing, flat sheets, decorated sheets, slates, soil pipes, decking for flat roofs and reinforced troughing - that kind of thing - the asbestos moulded into a multiplicity of shapes for the benefit of the building trade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To him Cape Universal was just a convenient place to work, a short walk across the moor for a day's shift and then home again for tea. He worked there for many years, from the 1930s to the 1960s, rising through the ranks from a labourer to a machine operator on the factory floor. On his death certificate his occupation was listed as 'Asbestos Moulder', and it was very much a premature death because this didn't end well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't remember very much about my grandfather because he died when I was 8. I know he was there when I took my first steps in his back garden and I can remember sitting at his dining room table and hoping nobody would force me to eat the celery. My final memory is being led up to his bedroom, I suspect not long before his death, to see an ill old man laid out in bed and struggling to breathe. I don't know what was said, nor how short a time I stayed in his presence, indeed my strongest recollection is of the room itself with its austere cupboards and the curtains drawn. And then at the age of 67 he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My family fought for asbestosis to be recognised as his cause of death but were not successful. I've read recently of fellow workers working at the Tolpits Lane factory now getting six figure payouts in compensation, indeed it's hard to research this topic without ending up on legal websites with popups urging you to make a claim. Even four decades after the factory's closure there are still employees severely affected, and many more already passed, as the toxic legacy endures. The factory site is now a rather cleaner industrial estate and business park, indeed it's where the National Lottery's been based for the last 30 years because risk and loss are still in play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today my Dad reaches the grand old age of 87, a full 20 years more than his father lived. Science has moved on a long way since the 1970s, also educational opportunities and also workers' rights. Health and safety is sometimes much derided but it can genuinely save lives, even much extend them, rather than everyone continually moaning about additional costs and annoying procedures. If someone had shouted earlier and louder about the dangers of asbestos I might have known my grandfather better, my grandmother could have had many more years of married life and my father could have had a father for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Dad lost his Dad at the age of 34, which is no age at all in the grand scheme of things. By contrast I still have my Dad at the age of 60, which has meant an extra quarter century of guidance, support, advice, love and always being there. How lucky am I? Every day we overlap with our parents is a blessing and I've had 22,000 of them, for all of which I'm truly grateful. We're off out later to celebrate with a slap-up dinner, or as slap-up as an 87-year-old stomach requires, which the wider family are greatly looking forward to. What Barking's memorial reminded me is that many families have not been so fortunate, and sometimes that loss can be very close to home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You already have a git server:&lt;/head&gt;(Programming)&lt;p&gt;If you have a git repository on a server with ssh access, you can just clone it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# This works. 
git clone ssh://username@hostname/path/to/repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can then work on it locally and push your changes back to the origin server. By default, git won’t let you push to the branch that is currently checked out, but this is easy to change:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Run this on the remote server. 
git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great way to sync code between multiple computers or to work on server-side files without laggy typing or manual copying. If you want to publish your code, just point your web server at the git repo:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://hostname/path/to/repo/.git
# You can get rid of the .git part of the command by either setting the
# server to remap it to a nicer URL or by just renaming the .git directory
# (although this stops you from running git server side)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;… although you will have to run this command server-side to make it cloneable:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Create some files used by git-over-http:
# Should be repeated after making changes.
git update-server-info
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of work, so let’s set up a hook to do that automatically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Automatically run git update-server-info.
# Should be run server-side
cp .git/hooks/post-update.sample .git/hooks/post-update
chmod a+x .git/hooks/post-update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Git hooks are just shell scripts, so they can do things like running a static site generator:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt; .git/hooks/post-update &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
#!/bin/sh
set -euo pipefail
cd /path/to/site
/path/to/generator
EOF
chmod a+x .git/hooks/post-update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how I’ve been doing this blog for a while now: It’s very nice to be able to type up posts locally (no network lag), and then push them to the server and have the rest handled automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also backed up by default: If the server breaks, I’ve still got the copy on my laptop, and if my laptop breaks, I can download everything from the server. Git’s version tracking also prevents accidental deletions, and if something breaks, it’s easy to figure out what caused it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

What surprised me is that feeding scrapers garbage is the cheapest and easiest thing I could do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Meet the bots:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren’t the indexing bots of old, but scrapers collecting data to train LLMs. Unlike search engines, which need the websites they crawl to stay up, AI companies provide a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise that these bots are aggressive and relentless: They ignore robots.txt, and if block them by user agent they just pretend to be a browser. If you ban their IP, they switch addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;… all while sending multiple requests per second, all day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Giving up:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what if we let them access the site?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serving static files is is relatively cheap, but not free. SSD access times are in the tens milliseconds, and that’s before you pay the filesystem tax. Bots also like to grab old and obscure pages, ones that are unlikely to be in cache. As a result, it doesn’t take all that many requests to bog down the server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the matter of bandwidth: Many blog posts also include images weighing hundreds to thousands of kB, which can add up quite quickly. With an average file size of 100 kB, 4 requests per second adds up to a terabyte each month – not a huge amount of data, but more then I’m willing to throw away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The ban hammer:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply making a list of IPs and blocking them would for normal bots…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;… but these are hardly normal bots. Because they are backed by billion dollar companies, they don’t just have a few addresses, but many thousands. If you managed to ban all of their addresses, they’ll just buy more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate limits fail for the same reason: They just switch IPs. I’ve even seen them using new IP for each request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building a wall:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, what about a pay-wall, login-wall, CAPTCHA-wall, or a hash based proof-of-work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these inconvenience users. Requiring an account guaranties that no one will read what I wrote. Even just a simple JavaScript challenge will block anyone who’s browser doesn’t support JS … and when it works, anything that must load before the does content still hugely slows down page loads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Throw them some bombs:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Serve them few gzip bombs, that’ll teach them” — Half the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gzip only provides a compression ratio of a little over 1000: If I want a file that expands to 100 GB, I’ve got to serve a 100 MB asset. Worse, when I tried it, the bots just shrugged it off, with some even coming back for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Jedi mind tricks:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, what if we just send them 404s – try and make them think my site doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tricks only work if your adversary has a mind to trick. If a link is posted somewhere, the bots will know it exists, and if they can’t access it, they’ll just become more aggressive:. sending more requests, with more user agents and using more addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping them happy keeps them tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Garbage:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;But surely sending them dynamically generated content would be expensive right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well… no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPU and RAM are the fastest parts of a modern computer. Dynamic content has the reputation of being slow because it often involves a database (lots of disk IO), a million lines of JavaScript, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My lightly optimized Markov babbler consumes around ~60 CPU microseconds per request. There’s no disk IO, and the memory cost is only around 1.2 MB. There’s also no rules or blacklists to maintain: the bots come to it and it consumes them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Making the Electron Microscope&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;In a little over a century, the electron microscope evolved from a tool barely capable of resolving virus particles into one able to capture atomic detail.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biological structures exist across a vast range of scales. At one end are whole organisms, varying in size from bacteria only a few micrometers across to mammals measured in feet.1 These can be seen with the naked eye or with simple light microscopes, which have been in use since the mid-1600s. At the smaller end, however, are atoms, amino acids, and proteins, spanning angstroms2 to nanometers in size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observing molecules at this smaller scale allows us to untangle the finer mechanisms of life: how individual neurons connect and communicate, how the ribosomal machinery translates genetic code into proteins, or how viruses like HIV invade and hijack host cells. Resolving fine structures, whether the double membrane of a chloroplast, the protein shell of a bacteriophage, or the branching architecture of a synapse, provides the bridge between atomic detail and whole-organism physiology, taking us from form to function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability to explore and map such minute mechanisms eluded scientists until the invention of the electron microscope. Conceived in the 1930s, it promised theoretical resolutions on the order of angstroms, nearly a hundred times finer than the most advanced light microscope of that era. In 1931, Ernst Ruska and his advisor Max Knoll, working at the Technical University in Berlin, designed the first prototype by replacing glass lenses with electromagnetic coils to focus beams of electrons instead of light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That first instrument barely outperformed a magnifying glass in terms of resolution. But over the next century, refinements in design, sample preparation, and computation transformed the electron microscope into an indispensable tool for modern biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1938, scientists used an electron microscope to take a photograph of a virus — the mouse ectromelia orthopoxvirus — for the first time.3 And today, modern cryo-electron microscopy, in which samples are frozen in liquid ethane prior to imaging, can resolve individual atoms within proteins. During the COVID-19 pandemic, cryo-electron microscopy revealed the spike protein in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which directly influenced the development of COVID vaccines. The technique also revealed a protein receptor that senses heat and pain, demonstrating how it translates physical signals to our nervous system, a breakthrough discovery that earned the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even as electron microscopes have allowed us to view ever smaller structures with clarity, challenges remain. One is that the images remain limited to static snapshots. Because samples must be imaged in a vacuum, it is impossible to directly observe the dynamism of live cells.4 In addition, specimens must be extremely thin to allow the electron beam to pass through, which prevents imaging of thick tissues. And finally, beyond these biological constraints, electron microscopes are physically large, can cost millions of dollars, and demand specialized facilities, training, and expertise to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, electron microscopy remains a powerful tool in biology, bridging the scales between molecular structure and living function. The story of its discovery is one of persistent ingenuity, involving a large cast of characters and numerous breakthroughs that helped make the modern electron microscope possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Seeds of an Idea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the late 19th century, biologists knew they were approaching the resolution limit of the light microscope. In their quest to see biology in finer detail, they had reached a barrier that light could not cross.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proof of this came from Ernst Abbe, a professor of experimental physics and mathematics at the University of Jena in Germany. Until Abbe, microscope design had been more of an art than a science, with innovators building optical instruments through trial and error. Carl Zeiss, who had begun manufacturing microscopes in the 1850s, approached Abbe in 1866 about using his scientific expertise for the construction of microscopes. Together, they began developing tools to improve the uniformity and quality of optical lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early 1870s, while working on the microscope objectives (the lens closest to the specimen in a microscope), Abbe discovered that the sharpness of an image did not only depend on how perfectly a lens was ground but also on how much diffracted light from the specimen the lens could capture. He realized that fine details in a specimen bend light into wide angles, and only objectives with a sufficiently large opening could collect those rays to bring the image into focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this insight, Abbe defined the concept of the “numerical aperture” (a measure of how much light a lens can gather5) and showed that the smallest visible detail is limited by the wavelength of light divided by twice this value.6 Even with ultraviolet light, at the short end of the visible spectrum (400 nanometers), the limit of resolution was 200 nanometers — larger than most viruses, intracellular structures, and protein complexes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hope of resolving structures beneath this resolution boundary only arrived in 1895, when the German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays, a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than those of ultraviolet light, and published a (now-iconic) image of his wife Bertha’s hand, with her bones and wedding ring clearly visible. This was the first time the hidden insides of the body could be seen without dissection. The bones, joints, and even metal fragments lodged inside the body could be made visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 1913 and 1915, the British physicist William Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg, developed a technique called X-ray crystallography. Working with simple crystals such as salt and diamond, they showed that when X-rays strike a regularly ordered crystal lattice, they diffract at specific angles that reveal the spacing of atoms within the crystal. The method works because X-rays have wavelengths about the size of chemical bonds, allowing the beams to reach and bounce off each atom in the lattice, reflecting the structure at an atomic scale. By applying a mathematical operation called a Fourier transform to these diffraction patterns captured on photographic plates, the Braggs reconstructed the three-dimensional arrangements of the atoms in the crystal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biomolecules, however, are not naturally crystalline. To study them, they had to be laboriously extracted, purified, and crystallized, separating them from their environment. The X-ray crystallography of biomolecules began in the 1930s, ushering in the field of structural biology. With sub-nanometer resolution, the invention of X-ray crystallography enabled a revolution in molecular biology. It was applied, for example, to solve the structures of DNA, hemoglobin, and insulin, molecules that have shaped the trajectory of modern biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But many biological targets remained out of reach. Viruses could rarely be crystallized, and cellular structures often lost their integrity when removed from their natural contexts. Thus, even with X-ray crystallography revealing the structures of small proteins and light microscopy capable of imaging cells, a gulf persisted between the study of small molecules and whole cells, which left much of biology invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, access to the parallel world of electrons was beginning to open. At the turn of the 20th century, Hans Busch, a German physicist at the University of Jena, was studying how electron beams behaved in magnetic fields. His work built on decades of experiments with cathode rays, streams of electrons released when a high voltage is applied inside a glass tube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cathode rays had become central to both physics and technology: Physicists used them to probe how electrons scattered, ionized gases, and responded to electric and magnetic fields, and engineers used them to form the basis of devices such as the radio and television. It was while trying to better understand and control these beams that Busch postulated his remarkable theories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1926 and 1927, Busch published two papers demonstrating mathematically that a magnetic coil could focus an electron beam in the same manner that a glass lens focuses light. While it was already known that coils could bend electron beams,7 Busch’s key insight was to frame this behavior in the language of optics: Electron beams could be treated like light rays. Concepts such as focal length, magnification, image formation, and even lens aberrations could all be applied to electrons. This meant that the well-developed theory of optical systems could be imported almost directly to other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nobel Prize–winning physicist and inventor of holography, Denis Gabor, later reflected on Busch’s contribution in a 1942 lecture: “Busch’s paper was more than an eye-opener; it was almost like a spark in an explosive mixture. In 1927, the situation in physics was such that nothing more than the words ‘electron lens’ were needed to start a real burst of creative activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so it was that Busch’s idea sparked the birth of electron optics. Within a few years, at least three independent inventors would lay claim to having designed the electron microscope, all tracing their inspiration back to his initial insight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The First Electron Microscope&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1928, the High Tension Laboratory at the Technical University in Berlin (a premier research facility focused on electrical engineering in the interwar years) was researching high-voltage power transmission and insulation. A persistent obstacle was the electrical surge often caused by thunderstorms, which repeatedly damaged the lab’s equipment. But before scientists could design a way to mitigate the problem, they first needed to understand it: Exactly when did these surges occur, and how fast or large were the voltage fluctuations?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To tackle this, the lab hoped to recruit a graduate student to create a proof-of-concept for a high-speed oscilloscope, a device that could directly visualize electrical pulses. A cathode ray oscilloscope worked by firing a beam of electrons across a phosphorescent screen inside a vacuum tube, where the impact produced a bright spot of light. Electric fields could be used to deflect the beam horizontally (to represent time) and vertically (to represent signal amplitude) so that electrical signals appeared as moving lines of light that could be observed directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although cathode ray oscilloscopes were already in use, they served mainly to capture slower signals. The high voltage surges experienced in thunderstorms or short circuiting events, though, flashed by in one hundred millionths of a second, leaving almost no trace on the screen. To make such fleeting signals visible, the intensity of the electron beam had to be increased, which meant focusing the beam into as small and powerful a spot as possible. Only one student applied to take on the challenge: 21-year-old Ernst Ruska.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruska was born into a family of scientists in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1906. He had been exposed to optics from an early age, as his uncle was an astronomer at the local observatory and his father, a science historian, owned a large optical microscope that Ruska was strictly forbidden to touch. He recalls in his Nobel lecture: “We would see on a table in the other room the pretty yellowish wooden box that housed my father’s big Zeiss microscope … He sometimes demonstrated to us interesting objects under the microscope, it is true; for good reasons, however, he feared that children’s hands would damage the objective or the specimen by clumsy manipulation of the coarse and line drive. Thus, our first relation to the value of microscopy was not solely positive.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike the rest of his family, Ruska’s passion leaned less toward science and more toward technical projects and problem-solving through engineering. While the other Ruska children spent their weekends with their father classifying rock samples or identifying bird calls, Ernst preferred tinkering with electrical switchboards and reading Max Eyth’s Behind Plow and Vice, a memoir on engineering and invention. And when he grew older, he recalls being fascinated by his high school physics teacher’s explanations of the movement of electrons through electrostatic fields and the limitations of light microscopes — an interest he carried into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the High Tension Laboratory, under Max Knoll, Ruska began building the much-anticipated oscilloscope. In this device, the incoming electrical current would pass through the vertical deflection plates, causing the electron beam to shift in proportion to the amplitude of the surge. To sharpen the image, a magnetic focusing coil was placed upstream of the deflection plates, concentrating the beam into a small, bright spot before it reached the phosphorescent screen. Ruska’s task was to determine the optimal placement of these coils so that the dot appeared as sharp as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For guidance, Ruska turned to Hans Busch’s recent papers on the lens-like action of magnetic fields on electron beams. In these papers, Busch had not only shown that a coil could act as a “magnetic electron lens,” but had also worked out the formulas describing electron trajectories in such a field and how the focal length changed with coil current. Using these calculations, Ruska confirmed Busch’s theories experimentally and determined the precise coil placement needed to bring the beam to a sharp focus. He then placed a small aperture in the beam’s path and, by varying the coil current, was able to project and record an image of the aperture at different magnifications on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Ruska later recalled in his Nobel lecture, his 1929 Master’s thesis contained “numerous sharp images with different magnifications of an electron-irradiated anode aperture … the first recorded electron-optical images.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1930, as Germany’s economy collapsed under the weight of post-war reparations and global depression, Ruska was unable to find work in industry and remained at the university for doctoral studies. Initially unsure of a research direction, he continued experimenting with magnetic lenses. He reasoned that if one coil could produce a magnified image, two in sequence might enlarge it further — the conceptual birth of the electron microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By April 1931, Ruska had constructed a two-stage imaging system with a total magnification of 14.4 times — still far below the roughly 1000-fold magnification achieved by high-quality light microscopes of the time. The system began with a cathode inside a vacuum tube, which emitted electrons when a high voltage was applied. These electrons were accelerated toward an anode and passed through a small aperture, forming a narrow beam, much like light through a pinhole. Magnetic coils wrapped around the tube acted as electron lenses. The first coil, placed close to the object, served as the objective lens, bringing the transmitted electrons into focus and forming an intermediate image. A second coil downstream acted as a projector lens, refocusing and enlarging that intermediate image so it could be captured onto a fluorescent screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By carefully tuning the currents in both coils, Ruska could control the focal lengths and achieve much higher magnifications than with a single lens. The final image appeared as glowing light patterns on the screen, with bright areas where electrons passed through the specimen and dark regions where they were absorbed or scattered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These images, photographed through a window in the tube, were the first electron micrographs, created by channeling electrons through successive magnetic lenses in a multistage system. Although its resolution was quite modest by today’s standards, this instrument is regarded as the first electron microscope. Ruska submitted the results for publication that same month, though the paper did not appear until August. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to him, between its submission and publication, a patent for an electron microscope had already been submitted by another inventor: Reinhold Rüdenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From Paralysis to First Patents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rüdenberg, born in Hanover in 1883, came of age during a golden decade of physics marked by Röntgen’s discovery of X-rays, the identification of the electron, and the first studies of radioactivity. As a high-school student, he eagerly replicated many of these experiments, building a two-way Morse telegraph, powering an X-ray tube with a hand-wound inductor, and constructing a radio transmitter and receiver. He received his first patent, for a radio oscillator, while still an electrical engineering student at the Technical University of Hanover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After earning his doctorate, Rüdenberg spent three years (1906-1908) at Göttingen University, working in applied mechanics and collaborating with leading figures in electron theory, including Hans Busch. In 1908, he joined Siemens in Berlin as a design engineer and, by 1923, had risen to the position of Chief Electrical Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While at Siemens, Rüdenberg developed several new electrical designs, among which were cooling systems for high-voltage generators, one of the first 60-megawatt turbine generators, conductors for high-voltage transmission lines, and relay systems for distant power stations. He also spent three years apprenticing in Siemens’ patent department, an experience that doubtless helped fuel his prolific output of them. He was a prolific inventor and is estimated to have held over a hundred unique patents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1930, while on vacation, Rüdenberg’s youngest son fell gravely ill. The three-year-old developed a high fever and paralysis. He had contracted polio. At a time when thousands were infected each year in Germany, with fatality rates around 15 percent, the diagnosis was devastating. Worse still, almost nothing was known about the “germ” responsible: No diagnostic test, no treatment, and no vaccine existed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This amazing fact and its significance for science and health gave me no rest in my thoughts,” Rüdenberg later recalled. “During many sleepless nights, tortured by the fate of my son, agonizing fantasies came and went, how to find ways to examine these minute germs, how possibly to attack them in order to attain healing or at least a standstill of the disease. Certainly, an agent finer than light had to be found to make these tiny viruses of immeasurable size visible to the human eye.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motivated by both paternal concern and engineering instinct, Rüdenberg began searching for a way to see such viruses. He considered X-rays but quickly dismissed them, as no method existed to focus the X-ray particles like visible light. Electrons, however, held promise. Having studied their behavior with Busch at Göttingen, he was aware of the focusing power of magnetic fields, and when Busch later published his 1926 and 1927 papers on magnetic electron lenses, he even sent copies directly to Rüdenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the winter of 1930-1931, Rüdenberg sketched out a complete conceptual design for an electron microscope, detailing its electron source, electrostatic lenses for focusing and magnification, and a fluorescent screen for visualization. In May 1931, just one week before Ruska publicly presented his own work, Rüdenberg submitted a series of patent applications describing this electron microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, unaware of Rüdenberg’s patents, Ruska also pressed forward. For his doctoral research, Ruska focused on improving the electromagnetic lens, whose magnification ability still lagged far behind the optical lenses of conventional light microscopes. At the time, a state-of-the-art light microscope could magnify images up to about 1000 times, whereas in 1932, extant electron microscopes were still stuck at a paltry 17-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To improve their performance, Ruska realized he needed to decrease the electron microscope’s focal length, since a shorter focal length would bend electrons more strongly, bringing them to a smaller focal point and producing a higher magnification. He discovered that encasing the coil in iron did so dramatically. This led to the invention of the polepiece lens, now a fundamental component of all electron microscopes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polepieces are shaped iron cylinders, each with a coil, placed a few millimeters apart. The narrow gap concentrates the magnetic field, producing a lens with stronger focusing ability and a shorter focal length. This not only increased the magnification but also provided more space to add a third lens (a condenser lens upstream of the sample) within the cathode ray column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During this time, Ruska and Knoll also made a bold attempt to estimate the theoretical resolution limit of the electron microscope. They applied the formula used in light microscopy and substituted the wavelength of electrons for that of light. For electrons accelerated at 75 kilovolts (higher voltages would increase the electrons’ energy and further shorten their wavelength, which, in principle, yields even finer detail), they arrived at a resolution limit of 2.2 angstroms (2.2 x 10-10 meters).8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruska submitted his dissertation in mid-1933 and later that year built a vastly improved microscope, achieving magnification up to 12,000 times. The images, taken of a scrap of aluminum foil, exceeded the resolution limit of the light microscope for the first time (even though the high-energy beam incinerated the samples).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruska observed that very thin foils produced sharper images with stronger contrast while also surviving longer under the beam. He reasoned that, in thin specimens, most electrons passed through without losing energy, elastically scattered (diffracted) rather than absorbed. These transmitted electrons still carried structural information and built up the image on the screen. Because fewer electrons deposited energy in the material, less heating and radiation damage occurred, allowing longer exposures and finer detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1934, Ruska had published these findings and even speculated about imaging biological material. He stated, “This microscopy is accessible to any objects (including all organic ones), provided that they can be prepared as sufficiently thin foils and introduced into the vacuum without suffering damage (structural alteration).” And, “For better visualization of such objects — one might think, for example, of nerve fibrils with their extremely fine structure — it will perhaps be necessary to develop ‘staining’ methods adapted to the problem, such as impregnation with metal salts (silvering), similar to those already commonly used in ordinary histological microscopy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rüdenberg’s design, meanwhile, was never built at Siemens. The political upheaval in Germany halted his advancement, as a German of Jewish descent, threatened his very survival. In 1936, with Siemens’ assistance, he and his family fled to England and, two years later, emigrated to the United States, where he became a professor of electrical engineering at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ironically, as a German, Rüdenberg was received with ambivalence; in 1942, during the war, his U.S. patents on the electron microscope were seized by the Alien Property Custodian, a government office tasked with seizing assets belonging to citizens of enemy nations during wartime. Post-war, he had to fight lengthy legal battles to reclaim them. He later consulted for Farrand Optical Company, a small company in New York which attempted to build an electrostatic microscope based on his patents, a venture which failed commercially. Happily, even as these obstacles abounded, his son made a full recovery from his polio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From Prototype to Commercialization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the early 1930s, electron microscopy had surpassed the resolving power of light microscopes, promising magnifications several orders of magnitude higher. Yet progress was uneven.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Belgium, the Hungarian physicist Ladislaus Marton built his own instrument by 1932 and produced the first biological electron micrographs: images of the insectivorous plant Drosera intermedia and the blood-red bacterium, Serratia marcescens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make such delicate samples visible, Marton turned to osmium tetroxide, a heavy metal compound that binds strongly to cellular membranes. By coating thin sections of Drosera intermedia with osmium, he increased their ability to scatter electrons, resulting in clearer contrast in the final image. He also introduced an electronic shutter, a device that blocked the electron beam during focusing and opened only for the brief moment of exposure. This protected fragile specimens from unnecessary radiation damage while still allowing sharp images to be captured. For a time, it seemed Marton was leading the field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruska, who had completed his PhD in 1933 and took a job in the television industry, returned to the field. He joined forces with Bodo von Borries, a longtime collaborator and future brother-in-law, to push the technology toward commercial viability. Between 1933 and 1935, they filed eight patents and canvassed a wide range of institutions for financial support. They approached the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, the board of optical manufacturer Carl Zeiss, and even steel companies to see if they had any need for electron microscopes. While initial efforts with Zeiss seemed promising, they collapsed when Zeiss withdrew due to Siemens’s rights to Reinhold Rüdenberg’s earlier patents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite these setbacks, interest in electron microscopy mounted. At the Technical School in Berlin, students modified Ruska’s prototypes to capture striking images of a fly’s leg hair magnified 25,000 times. To make the tissues more resistant to the beam, they used potassium dichromate, a fixative that coss-linked lipids and proteins in the tissue so it was less likely to collapse or vaporize. This fixative also increased scattering contrast, making fine details easier to discern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specimens were cooled to –17 °C, which reduced thermal motion and slowed the buildup of heat from inelastic electron collisions. Cooling didn’t prevent radiation damage, but it delayed it long enough for images to be recorded. These were early explorations of the cryogenic methods that would later define the field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1936, electron microscopy centered around a highly active (albeit small) community with Marton in Belgium, Ruska and von Borries in Berlin, and younger researchers at their university extending the work. However, all still lacked financial support to develop a commercial system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Momentum shifted when Ruska spoke at the 1936 German Conference of Physicists and Mathematicians. His brother Helmut, a physician newly appointed at Berlin’s University Hospital, added crucial medical endorsement by promoting the microscope’s potential in medical applications. This medical credibility brought Siemens back to the table. With both Siemens and Zeiss expressing interest, Ruska and von Borries chose Siemens, which already held the Rüdenberg patents and had stronger electrotechnical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 1937, a decade after Hans Busch first theorized the electron lens, Siemens launched development of the first commercial electron microscope in Berlin. By 1938, the first model was available, offering magnification of up to 30,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The device was a triumph of Ruska’s bench-top experiments and relentless iteration. At the top of the microscope column sat the cathode, generating electrons accelerated downward at high voltage. A condenser lens collected, narrowed, and focused the electron beam to illuminate the sample, which was introduced through a small vacuum airlock and held on a stage. Immediately below it lay the objective lens, a powerful magnetic coil that brought the transmitted electrons into sharp focus, forming a first, intermediate image. A second coil, the projection lens, then enlarged this image and cast it onto a fluorescent screen, where bright and dark regions revealed the specimen’s structure. Researchers could view the glowing picture directly through a built-in window or capture it on photographic plates housed beneath the screen. To maintain stable operation, the entire column was kept under high vacuum by a mercury diffusion pump.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shared Siemens laboratory was set up and became an important hub for producing some of the earliest biological electron micrographs. Directed by Helmut Ruska, it housed four instruments available to visiting scientists, many of them biologists and medical researchers. In 1939 alone, nearly 2,000 images were produced, leading to 23 publications. Among them were the first electron micrographs of viruses, bacteriophages, and fine biological details never before seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lab itself was destroyed in an air raid in 1944, and it would take nearly a decade before Siemens in Germany regained its footing in electron microscopy. But by then, the electron microscopy spark had spread: Laboratories in Britain and the United States continued to drive the field forward, building on the groundwork laid in Berlin. Ernst Ruska would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 for his fundamental work in electron optics and microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inside an Electron Microscope&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly a century after its invention, the electron microscope has transformed from a tool barely capable of resolving fuzzy virus particles into one capable of capturing atomic detail. While its progress has mostly been marked by steady refinements, it has also been punctuated by key breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, from the start, electron microscopy for biology faced a water problem. Because the microscope operates under high vacuum, liquid water evaporates instantly, leaving delicate biological samples collapsed or distorted. To avoid this, aqueous samples had to be dried, fixed, or stained, which produced recognizable images but with obvious artifacts, such as shrunken cells, ruptured membranes, and structural distortions that no longer reflected the living state. Through the 1940s and 1950s, embedding samples in resins and the use of ultra-thin sectioning made cellular ultrastructure visible, while freeze-drying and early cryogenic sectioning offered partial preservation of hydrated material, though the results were still plagued by distortion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A breakthrough came in the early 1980s, when Jacques Dubochet and his colleagues at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg demonstrated that water could be vitrified; that is, cooled so rapidly that it solidifies into glass rather than crystallizing, finally allowing biomolecules to be preserved and imaged as they are in life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In parallel, computational techniques were improving. Beginning in the 1970s, Joachim Frank developed statistical methods for aligning and averaging thousands of noisy electron micrographs of individual macromolecules. This “single-particle analysis” transformed faint, low-contrast images into coherent 3D reconstructions. When combined with Dubochet’s vitrification method, the two advances gave rise to single-particle cryo-electron microscopy: Molecules suspended in vitreous ice could be imaged in random orientations and computationally combined into detailed three-dimensional structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three decades later, with the arrival of direct electron detectors, developed with the efforts of Richard Henderson and with more powerful algorithms, single-particle cryo-EM entered its “resolution revolution,” routinely delivering near-atomic detail and firmly establishing itself as one of the central methods of structural biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s most advanced cryo-electron microscopes stand nearly two stories tall, cost millions of dollars, and operate with breathtaking precision. But they still rest on the same foundation laid in the 1930s: a beam of electrons, shaped by magnetic fields, interacting with matter to reveal what light cannot.&lt;lb/&gt;At the top of the vertical column is the electron gun, the source of the beam. A fine tungsten filament or sharp field-emission tip is held at high negative voltage, often 200–300 kilovolts, so electrons are released and accelerated down the column. At these energies, electrons travel close to the speed of light, with wavelengths thousands of times shorter than visible light, giving them their extraordinary resolving power. To prevent scattering, the column is maintained in an ultra-high vacuum, as even trace gases could deflect or scatter the beam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Magnetic lenses, made of coiled wire encased in iron polepieces, focus and steer the electrons much like glass lenses bend light. The condenser lens narrows the beam onto the sample, while the objective lens forms the first magnified image. Additional projector lenses enlarge this image and deliver it to a detector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the beam passes through the specimen, electrons interact with its atoms. Some scatter elastically, shifting phase without losing energy; others scatter inelastically, losing energy, and are either absorbed or filtered out. The transmitted electrons carry structural information, encoded as variations in amplitude and phase, and create a contrast image on the detector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In cryo-EM, millions of such low-contrast 2D projections are collected, each a noisy snapshot of a molecule in a random orientation. Computational algorithms align, classify, and combine them, using a mathematical method that breaks the images down into their underlying patterns of waves (using the Fourier transform), then piece those patterns back together to form a detailed 3D map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result begins as a grainy micrograph, but when assembled and refined, this picture reveals extraordinary detail: the honeycomb lattice of graphene, the folds of a viral capsid, or the ribosome caught mid-translation. &lt;lb/&gt;Today, no single imaging method captures everything. For following fast processes, tracking molecules in living cells, or imaging whole organisms, light microscopy remains indispensable. For atomic resolution of well-ordered proteins, X-ray crystallography is still unmatched. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when it comes to bridging the scales between atoms and cells, there is no better tool than the electron microscope. The same instrument that in 1938 revealed the faint silhouettes of mouse ectromelia virus now resolves viral proteins at the scale of a chemical bond, an arc of progress that has helped biologists redefine what it means to “see.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smrithi Sunil is a research scientist developing imaging techniques to study how the brain works across scales. She has developed multimodal microscopy methods to bridge molecular, cellular, and systems-level measurements of structure and function. She also writes about science and metascience on her Substack, Engineering Discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One of the smallest known whole organisms is the bacteria Mycoplasma genitalium roughly 200 nm across. In contrast, the mycelium network Armillaria ostoyae in the Malheur National Forest in Oregon is possibly the largest living organism, covering almost four square miles and weighing around 35,000 tons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The length between chemical bonds is measured in Angstroms, named after Swedish physicist Anders Jonas Angstrom who first described the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year later, in 1939, Gustav Kausche, Edgar Pfankuch, and Helmut Ruska reported the first images of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Although TMV is often cited as the “first” virus to be imaged with an electron microscope since TMV was a classic model virus in biology and its rod-shaped form was immediately recognizable, the mouse orthopoxvirus micrographs technically appeared earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To work around this, scientists capture dynamics indirectly by freezing specimens at different stages of a process (such as during the assembly of a protein complex) and then reconstruct the sequence from these static frames.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Numerical aperture NA = n sin θ, where n is the refractive index of the medium and θ is the half-angle of the widest cone of light the lens can accept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twice this value arises because fine structures in a specimen diffract light into symmetric beams on opposite sides of the optical axis. When both of these beams are captured by the objective and brought together at the image plane, they interfere with reconstructing the alternating patterns of light and dark that represent the specimen’s fine detail. Note that Abbe’s formula is for coherent transmitted light and not for fluorescent imaging. In fluorescence microscopy, each molecule emits light independently rather than by interfering wavefronts, so the image is not formed by overlapping diffraction orders. The resolution is instead limited by the microscope’s point spread function, described by the Rayleigh criterion (d = 1.22 λ / 2 NA), which sets the smallest distance at which two fluorescent emitters can be distinguished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even before “electrons” were named, Julius Plücker showed in the 1850s that magnetic fields could deflect the glowing path of cathode rays. Johann Hittorf (1869) and Kristian Birkeland (1896) had independently used magnetic coils to focus them. Hans Busch was the first to provide mathematical calculations for the electron trajectories during this focusing action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This resolution was, in fact, achieved 40 years later. Today, electron microscopy has even surpassed that mark: Scientists have resolved biological structures to well below 2 angstroms, including the GABA receptor, a membrane protein channel that mediates inhibitory neurotransmission, at 1.7 angstroms. In this system, the electrons were accelerated to 300 kilovolts, yielding a resolution better than the one Ruska proposed with only 75 kilovolts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ken Thompson Recalls Unix’s Rowdy, Lock-Picking Origins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 82-year-old Ken Thompson has some amazing memories about the earliest days of the Unix operating system — and the rowdy room full of geeks who built it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month Silicon Valley’s Computer History Museum released a special four-and-a-half-hour oral history, in partnership with the Association for Computing Machinery, recorded 18 months ago by technology historian David C. Brock. And Thompson dutifully recalled many of his career highlights — from his work on the C programming language and Unix to the “Plan 9 from Bell Labs” operating system and the Go programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what comes through is his gratefulness for the people he’d worked with, and the opportunity they’d had to all experiment together in an open environment to explore the limits of new and emerging technologies. It’s a tale of curiosity, a playful sense of serendipity and the enduring value of a community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And along the way, Thompson also tells the story of raising a baby alligator that a friend sent to his office at Bell Labs. (“It just showed up in the mail… They’re not the sweetest of pets.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Accidental Birth of Unix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Travel back in time to 1966, when 23-year-old Thompson’s first project at Bell Labs was the ill-fated Multics, a collaboration with MIT and General Electric which Thompson remembers as “horrible… big and slow and ugly and very expensive,” requiring a giant specially-built computer just to run and “just destined to be dead before it started.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when the Multics project died, “the computer became completely available — this one-of-a-kind monster computer… and so I took advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson had wanted to work with CRAM, a data storage device with a high-speed drum memory, but like disk storage of the time, it was slow to read from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson thought he’d improve the situation with simultaneous (and overlapping) memory reads, but of course this required programs for testing, plus a way to load and run them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And suddenly, without knowing it — I mean, this is sneaking up on me…. Suddenly it’s an operating system!” Thompson’s initial memory-reading work became “the disk part” for Unix’s filesystem. He still needed a text editor and a user-switching multiplexing layer (plus a compiler and an assembler for programs), but it already had a filesystem, a disk driver and I/O peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson wondered if it took so long to recognize its potential because he’d been specifically told not to work on operating systems. Multics “was a bad experience” for Bell Labs, he’d been told. “We spent a ton of money on it, and we got nothing out of it!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I actually got reprimands saying, ‘Don’t work on operating systems. Bell Labs is out of operating systems!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;One-Digit User IDs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now Unix had its first user community — future legends like Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, Robert Morris and occasionally Brian Kernighan. (“All the user IDs were one digit. That definitely put a limit on it.”) Thompson remembers designing the Unix filesystem on a blackboard in an office with Rudd Canaday — using a special Bell Labs phone number that took dictation and delivered a typed-up transcript the next day. And Joe Ossanna “got things done” with a special talent for navigating Bell Labs’ bureaucracy that ultimately procured a crucial PDP-11 for the Unix team to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We were being told no, ‘because we don’t deal in operating systems.'” But Ossanna knew the patent department was evaluating a third-party system for preparing documents — and Ossanna proposed an in-house alternative. “So we got our first PDP-11 to do word processing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And history shows that it happened partly because the department paying for it “had extra money, and if they didn’t spend it, they’d lose it the next year…”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the young Unix community picked up somewhere between five and eight new users, Thompson remembers, “the secretaries for the Patent Department, writing patents on our system!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Fellowship of the Unix Room&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That PDP-11 wound up in “a spot on the sixth floor where we cleaned out a vending machine and a couple of cages of stored junk from 1920,” Thompson remembered. They eventually installed a second PDP-11, which turned the room into “a hotbed of things,” with discussions about networking — and an upcoming typesetter for documents. Thompson calls it the Unix room, and most of them eventually had extensions for their phones wired into the room. (It even had its own call-switching PBX …)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was camaraderie and some laughter. He adds later, almost as an aside, that “in the Unix room, we used to pick locks a lot and steal things.” (When one of the secretaries discovered security had affixed a “parking boot” to her car that was parked in the wrong zone, “we went down there, and we picked the lock and stole the boot. And after that, slowly, we picked up all four boots, and we hid them under the raised floor of the Unix room…”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The punchline? “The head of security came around and pleaded with us. ‘We won’t pick on your secretaries if you give us back our boots.'”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the deal was accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson remembers things like gathering for a regular “Unix lunch” in the Bell Labs lunchroom, which “caused a symbiosis of thought and things. It was great.” Although it always seemed to happen just minutes after the lunchroom stopped serving food. “If I was late, I’d buy McDonald’s and sit down at the lunchroom with my McDonald’s. They used to get mad at me for that …”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Growing From Community&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking back, Thompson credited the success of C and Unix to Bell Labs and its no-pressure/no users environment. “It was essentially a ‘whatever you want to do’ atmosphere, and ‘for anybody you wanted to do it for’… Bell Labs was by far the biggest contributor to this whole type of programming.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bell Labs was an eclectic mix, but this community paid unexpected dividends. While Lee McMahon was originally hired as a linguistics researcher, he was ultimately the one who procured machine-readable dictionaries for the Unix team, along with machine-readable version of the Federalist Papers. (When the whole text wouldn’t fit into their text editor ed, Thompson famously created the line-by-line pattern-scanning tool grep.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in the end Thompson says Unix grew from there for one simple fact: People liked it. It spread within Bell Labs, at first for “the administrative kind of stuff, typing in trouble tickets…” But this being a phone company, “then it started actually doing some switching, and stuff like that. It was getting deeper and deeper into the guts of the Bell System and becoming very popular.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Open Before Open Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson credits Richard Stallman with developing much more of the open source philosophy. “But Unix had a bit of that.” Maybe it grew out of what Dennis Ritchie was remembering, that fellowship that formed around Unix. “For some reason, and I think it’s just because of me and Dennis, everything was open…”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was just the way they operated. “We had protection on files — if you didn’t want somebody to read it, you could set some bits and then nobody could read them, right? But nobody set those permissions on anything … All of the source was writable, by anybody! It was just open …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you had an idea for an editor, you’d pull the editor out and you’d write on it and put it back … There was a mantra going around that, ‘You touch it, you own it.'”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson provides an example: Bell Labs co-worker P. J. Plauger, with whom he later wrote the 1974 book “Elements of Programming Style.” Plauger was also a professional science fiction writer, Thompson remembers, “And whatever he was writing on was in his directory, right? So, we’d all go in there and be reading it as he’s writing it … and we’d all write back, ‘You ought to kill this guy, and move him over here and turn him green!’ or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And he didn’t mind it, because that’s just the theory of Unix in those days …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I think that generated a fellowship. Just the fact that it was like writing on a blackboard — everybody read it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And more of their Bell Labs experiments found their way into the world when some work on the later Plan 9 operating system found its way into the UTF-8 standard, which underlies most of today’s web connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;After Bell Labs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson left Bell Labs in 2000, after the breakup of the Bell system. (“It had changed; it was really different … You had to justify what you were doing, which is way above my pay grade.”) But his three decades there seemed to shine an influence over the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson first moved on to a networking equipment company called Entrisphere, where he worked for six years — and a move to Google was the natural next step. The head at Entrisphere had already moved to Google, and was urging Thompson to follow him — and it turned out that Google CEO Eric Schmidt was an old friend who’s actually worked at Bell Labs in 1975. (Thompson says Google made him “an exceedingly good offer”…)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Google Thompson worked “a little bit” on Android security. (“I found a couple of specific problems, but by and large, it was very well done”.) But eventually Thompson joined the three-person team that would create the programming language Go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he was doing the work with Rob Pike, who was one of his old comrades from Bell Labs nearly 30 years before!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Alzheimer’s disrupts circadian rhythms of plaque-clearing brain cells&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse study shows how disease reprograms genes in specialized cells involved in amyloid removal&lt;/p&gt;Getty Images&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is notorious for scrambling patients’ daily rhythms. Restless nights with little sleep and increased napping during the day are early indicators of disease onset, while sundowning, or confusion later in the day, is typical for later stages of the disease. These symptoms suggest a link between the progression of the disease and the circadian system — the body’s internal clock that controls our sleep and wake cycle — but scientists did not know the full nature of the connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have now shown in mice that the circadian rhythms within particular brain cells are disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease in ways that change how and when hundreds of genes regulate key functions in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published October 23 in Nature Neuroscience, suggest that controlling or correcting these circadian rhythms could be a potential way to treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are 82 genes that have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk, and we found that the circadian rhythm is controlling the activity of about half of those,” said Erik S. Musiek, MD, PhD, the Charlotte &amp;amp; Paul Hagemann Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, who led the study. In mice modeling Alzheimer’s disease, the typical daily activity patterns of those genes were altered. “Knowing that a lot of these Alzheimer’s genes are being regulated by the circadian rhythm gives us the opportunity to find ways to identify therapeutic treatments to manipulate them and prevent the progression of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musiek, the co-director of the Center on Biological Rhythms and Sleep (COBRAS) at WashU Medicine and a neurologist who specializes in aging and dementia, said that changes in sleep patterns are among the most frequent concerns reported to him by caregivers of Alzheimer’s patients. He and colleagues have previously shown that these changes begin in Alzheimer’s years before memory loss becomes apparent. He noted that in addition to creating burdens for caregivers and patients, disrupted sleep patterns generate biological and psychological stresses that accelerate the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking this feedback loop requires identifying its origins. The body’s circadian clock is thought to act on 20% of all genes in the human genome, controlling when they turn on or off to manage processes including digestion, the immune system and our sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musiek had previously identified a specific protein, YKL-40, that fluctuates across the circadian cycle and regulates normal levels of amyloid protein in the brain. He found that too much of YKL-40, which is linked to Alzheimer’s risk in humans, leads to amyloid build-up, an accumulation that is a hallmark of the neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Amyloid disrupts rhythmic brain functions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cyclic nature of Alzheimer’s symptoms suggests that there are more circadian-regulated proteins and their associated genes involved beyond YKL-40. So in this latest study, Musiek and his colleagues examined gene expression in the brains of mice with accumulations of amyloid proteins that mimic early stages of Alzheimer’s, as well as those of both healthy, young animals and aged mice without amyloid accumulations. The scientists collected tissue at 2-hour intervals over 24 hours and then performed an analysis of what genes were active during particular phases of the circadian cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the amyloid accumulations threw off the daily rhythms of hundreds of genes in brain cells known as microglia and astrocytes in ways that were different from what aging alone caused. Microglia are part of the brain’s immune response, clearing away toxic materials and dead cells, while astrocytes have roles in supporting and maintaining communication between neurons. The affected genes are generally involved in helping microglial cells break down waste material from the brain, including amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the circadian disruption didn’t entirely shut down the genes in question, it turned an orderly sequence of events into a scattershot affair that could degrade the optimal synchronicity of brain cells’ functions, such as clearing amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers found that the presence of amyloid appeared to create new rhythms in hundreds of genes that do not typically have a circadian pattern of activity. Many of the genes are involved in the brain’s inflammatory response to infection or imbalances such as amyloid plaque build-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musiek said that altogether the findings point to exploring therapies that target circadian cycles in microglia and astrocytes to support healthy brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a lot of things we still need to understand, but where the rubber meets the road is trying to manipulate the clock in some way, make it stronger, make it weaker or turn it off in certain cell types,” he said. “Ultimately, we hope to learn how to optimize the circadian system to prevent amyloid accumulation and other aspects of Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

This paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory, the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning, memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged" cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 57%) concretely quantify both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Long Phan [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Tue, 21 Oct 2025 01:28:35 UTC (20,673 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Thu, 23 Oct 2025 18:00:45 UTC (20,299 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How We Saved $500,000 Per Year by Rolling Our Own “S3”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;tl;dr&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used S3 as a landing zone for Nanit’s video processing pipeline (baby sleep-state inference), but at thousands of uploads/second, S3’s PutObject request fees dominated costs. Worse, S3’s auto-cleanup (Lifecycle rules) has a 1-day minimum; we paid for 24 hours of storage on objects processed in ~2 seconds. We built N3, a Rust-based in-memory landing zone that eliminates both issues, using S3 only as an overflow buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result: meaningful cost reduction (~$0.5M/year).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1: Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;High-Level Overview of Our Video Processing Pipeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cameras record video chunks (configurable duration).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each chunk, the camera requests an S3 presigned URL from the Camera Service and uploads directly to S3.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An AWS Lambda posts the object key to an SQS FIFO queue (sharded by baby_uid).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Video processing pods consume from SQS, download from S3, and produce sleep states.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a deeper dive, see this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What We Like About This Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Landing on S3 + queuing to SQS decouples camera uploads from video processing. During maintenance or temporary downtime, we don’t lose videos; if queues grow, we scale processing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With S3, we don’t manage availability or durability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SQS FIFO + group IDs preserve per-baby ordering, keeping processing nodes mostly stateless (coordination happens in SQS).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;S3 Lifecycle rules offload GC: objects expire after one day, so we don’t track processed videos.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why We Changed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PutObject costs dominated. Our objects are short-lived: videos land for seconds, then get processed. At our scale (thousands of uploads/s), the per-object request charge was the largest cost driver. Increasing chunking frequency (i.e., sending more, smaller chunks) to cut latency raises costs linearly, because each additional chunk is another PutObject request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Storage was a secondary tax. Even when processing finished in ~2 s, Lifecycle deletes meant paying for ~24 h of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We needed a design that kept reliability and strict ordering while avoiding per-object costs on the happy path and minimizing “pay-to-wait” storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 2: Planning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Guiding Principles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simplicity through architecture: Eliminate complexity at the design level, not through clever implementations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Correctness: A true drop-in replacement that’s transparent to the rest of the pipeline.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimize for the happy path: Design for the normal case and use S3 as a safety net for edge cases. Our processing algorithms are robust to occasional gaps, so we can prioritize simplicity over building complex guarantees; S3 provides reliability when needed.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design Drivers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Short-lived objects: segments live on the landing zone for seconds, not hours.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ordering: strict per-baby sequencing (no processing newer before older).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Throughput: thousands of uploads/second; 2–6 MB per segment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Client limits: cameras have limited retries; don’t assume retransmits.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Operations: tolerate multi-million-item backlogs during maintenance/scale-ups.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No firmware changes: must work with existing cameras.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Loss tolerance: very small gaps are acceptable; algorithms mask them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cost: avoid per-object S3 costs on the happy path; minimize “pay-to-wait” storage.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design at a Glance (N3 Happy Path + S3 Overflow)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;N3 is a custom landing zone that holds videos in memory just long enough for processing to drain them (~2 seconds). S3 is used only when N3 can’t handle the load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;N3-Proxy (stateless, dual interfaces): &lt;lb/&gt;- External (Internet-facing): Accepts camera uploads via presigned URLs.&lt;lb/&gt;- Internal (private): Issues presigned URLs to Camera Service.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;N3-Storage (stateful, internal-only): Stores uploaded segments in RAM and enqueues SQS with a pod-addressable download URL.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video processing pods consume from SQS FIFO and download from whichever storage the URL points to: N3 or S3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normal Flow (Happy Path)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Camera requests an upload URL from Camera Service.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Camera Service calls N3-Proxy’s internal API for a presigned URL.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Camera uploads video to N3-Proxy’s external endpoint.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;N3-Proxy forwards to N3-Storage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;N3-Storage holds video in memory and enqueues to SQS with a download URL pointing to itself.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Processing pod downloads from N3-Storage and processes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two-Tier Fallback&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tier 1: Proxy-level fallback (per-request): &lt;lb/&gt;If N3-Storage can’t accept an upload whether from memory pressure, processing backlog, or pod failure N3-Proxy uploads to S3 on the camera’s behalf.&lt;lb/&gt;(Camera got a presigned N3 URL before the failure was detected)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tier 2: Cluster-level reroute (all traffic): &lt;lb/&gt;If N3-Proxy or N3-Storage is unhealthy, Camera Service stops issuing N3 URLs and returns S3 presigned URLs directly.&lt;lb/&gt;(All traffic flows to S3 until N3 recovers.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Two Components?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We split N3-Proxy and N3-Storage because they have different requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Blast radius: If storage crashes, proxy can still route to S3. If proxy crashes, only that node’s traffic is affected; not the entire storage cluster.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Resource profiles: Proxy is CPU/network-heavy (TLS termination). Storage is memory-heavy (holding videos). Different instance types and scaling requirments.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Storage never touches the Internet.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rollout safety: We can update proxy (stateless) without touching storage (holding active data).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Validating the Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The architecture made sense on paper, but we had critical unknowns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Capacity &amp;amp; sizing: real upload durations across client networks; how much compute and upload buffer size we need?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Storage model: can we keep everything in RAM, or do we need disks?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Resilience: how to load balance cheaply and handle failed nodes?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Operational policy: GC needs, retry expectations, and whether delete-on-GET is sufficient.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unknown unknowns: what edge cases would emerge when idea meet reality?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To de-risk decisions, we ran two tracks during planning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Approach 1: Synthetic Stress Tests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a load generator to push the system to its limits: varying concurrency, slow clients, sustained load, and processing downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goal: Find breaking points. Surface bottlenecks we hadn’t anticipated. Get deterministic baselines for capacity planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Approach 2: Production PoC (Mirror Mode)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthetic tests can’t replicate real camera behavior: flaky Wi-Fi, diverse firmware versions, unpredictable network conditions. We needed in-the-wild data without risking production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mirror mode: n3-proxy wrote to S3 first (preserving prod), then also to a PoC N3-Storage wired to a canary SQS + video processors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Targeted cohorts: by firmware version / Baby-UID lists&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data parity: compared sleep states PoC vs. production; investigated any diffs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Observability: per-path dashboards (N3 vs. S3), queue depth, latency/RPS, error budgets, egress breakdown.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feature flags (via Unleash) were critical. We could flip cohorts on/off in real-time; no deployments; letting us test narrow slices (older firmware, weak Wi-Fi cameras) and revert instantly if issues appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What We Discovered&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bottlenecks: TLS termination consumed most CPU, and AWS burstable networking throttled us after credits expired.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory-only storage was viable. Real upload-time distributions and concurrency showed we could fit the working set in RAM with safe headroom; disks not required.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Delete-on-GET is safe. We did not observe re-downloads; retries happen downstream in the processor, so N3 doesn’t need to support download retries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We need lightweight GC. Some segments get skipped by processing and would never be downloaded/deleted; added a TTL GC pass to clean stragglers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These findings shaped our implementation: memory-backed storage, network- optimized instances with TLS optimization, and delete-on-GET with TTL GC for stragglers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 3: Implementation Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DNS Load Balancing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;n3-proxy&lt;/code&gt; is a DaemonSet on dedicated nodes, one pod per node to maximize network and CPU resources for TLS termination. We need node-level load balancing and graceful restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An AWS Network Load Balancer would work, but at our throughput (thousands of uploads/second, sustained multi-GB/s), the combination of fixed costs plus per-GB processed fees becomes expensive. Instead, we use DNS-based load balancing via Route53 multi-value A records, which is significantly cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each node we create a MultiValue record that contains a single IP.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each record has a health check that hits an external readiness endpoint.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A records use a short 30-second TTL.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives us:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If a node fails, it’s taken out of the pool and cameras stop uploading to it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Because the external readiness endpoint is also used as the Kubernetes readiness probe, marking a pod Not Ready during rollouts automatically removes it from DNS.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rollout process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;n3-proxy&lt;/code&gt; pods have a graceful shutdown mechanism:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On SIGTERM, the pod enters paused mode.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Readiness becomes Not Ready, but uploads are still accepted.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wait 2× DNS TTL (e.g., 60s) so the DNS health check removes the node and camera DNS caches update.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Drain active connections, then restart.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On startup, wait for health checks to pass and for client DNS TTLs to expire before rolling to the next pod (lets the node rejoin the pool).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Networking Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When doing initial benchmarks to size the cluster, we saw a surprising pattern: runs started near ~1k RPS, then dropped to ~70 RPS after ~1 minute. Restarting didn’t help; after waiting and rerunning, we briefly saw ~1k RPS again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that when AWS says an instance can do “Up to 12.5 Gbps”, that’s burstable networking backed by credits; when you’re below the baseline, you accrue credits and can burst for short periods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baseline depends on instance family and vCPUs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non–network-optimized: ~0.375 Gbps/vCPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Network-optimized (suffix “n”): ~3.125 Gbps/vCPU&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for instances that don’t say “Up to,” you get the stated Gbps continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion: our workload is steady, so bursts don’t help. We moved to network optimized c8gn.4xlarge nodes, which provide 50 Gbps each, giving us the sustained throughput we need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;HTTPS, rustls, and Graviton4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, for simplicity, we used a &lt;code&gt;stunnel&lt;/code&gt; sidecar for HTTPS termination, but early stress testing showed HTTPS was the main CPU consumer and primary bottleneck. We made three changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Moved from &lt;code&gt;stunnel&lt;/code&gt;to native rustls.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upgraded from Graviton3 to Graviton4 instances.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compiled &lt;code&gt;n3-proxy&lt;/code&gt;with target-cpu and crypto features enabled.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[profile.release]&lt;lb/&gt;opt-level = 3&lt;lb/&gt;lto = "fat"&lt;lb/&gt;codegen-units = 1&lt;lb/&gt;split-debuginfo = "off"&lt;lb/&gt;debug = false&lt;lb/&gt;panic = "abort"&lt;lb/&gt;overflow-checks = false&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]&lt;lb/&gt;rustflags = [&lt;lb/&gt;    "-C", "target-cpu=neoverse-v2",&lt;lb/&gt;    "-C", "target-feature=+sve2,+sve2-aes,+sve2-sha3,+sve2-sm4,+sve2-bitperm,+crypto"&lt;lb/&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These changes yielded ~30% higher RPS at the same cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outgoing Traffic Costs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We assumed that since we only receive uploads (ingress is free) and don’t send payloads to clients, egress would be negligible. Post-launch, we saw non-trivial outbound traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TLS handshakes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each upload opens a new TLS connection, so a full handshake runs and sends ~7 KB of certificates. In theory we could reduce this with smaller (e.g., ECDSA) certs, session resumption/tickets, or long-lived connections; but given our constraint of not changing camera behavior, we accept this overhead for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ACKs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, TLS handshakes were only a small part of the outbound bytes. A &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; showed many &lt;code&gt;66-byte&lt;/code&gt; ACKs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tshark -r n3-3.pcap \&lt;lb/&gt;  -Y 'tcp.srcport==32443 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !(tcp.analysis.retransmission || tcp.analysis.fast_retransmission)' \&lt;lb/&gt;  -T fields -e tcp.len -e frame.len \&lt;lb/&gt;| awk '{&lt;lb/&gt;  total += $2&lt;lb/&gt;  if ($1 == 0) { ack += $2 } else { data_frames += $2; payload += $1 }&lt;lb/&gt;}&lt;lb/&gt;END {&lt;lb/&gt;  printf "total_bytes=%d\nack_frame_bytes=%d (%.1f%%)\ndata_frame_bytes=%d (%.1f%%)\n",&lt;lb/&gt;         total, ack, 100*ack/total, data_frames, 100*data_frames/total&lt;lb/&gt;  printf "tcp_payload_bytes=%d (of data frames)\n", payload&lt;lb/&gt;}'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a short traffic capture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;total_bytes = 37,014,432&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ack_frame_bytes = 31,258,550 (84.4%)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;data_frame_bytes = 5,755,882 (15.6%)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~85% of outbound bytes were ACK frames.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With ~1500-byte MTUs and frequent ACKs, overhead adds up. While we can’t easily reduce the number of ACKs, we can make each ACK smaller by removing TCP timestamps (−12 bytes/ACK):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps=0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kubernetes init-container:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;spec:&lt;lb/&gt;  initContainers:&lt;lb/&gt;  - name: set-sysctl&lt;lb/&gt;    image: alpine:3.20&lt;lb/&gt;    securityContext: { privileged: true }&lt;lb/&gt;    command: ["sh","-c","sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps=0"]&lt;lb/&gt;  containers:&lt;lb/&gt;  - name: your-app&lt;lb/&gt;    image: ...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t without risk: with high byte counts on the same socket, sequence numbers can wrap and delayed packets may be mis-merged, causing corruption.&lt;lb/&gt;Mitigations: (1) new socket per upload; (2) recycle &lt;code&gt;n3-proxy&lt;/code&gt; ↔ &lt;code&gt;n3-storage&lt;/code&gt; sockets after ~1 GB sent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory Leak&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the initial launch, we saw steady n3-proxy memory growth. Even after traffic stopped, the process returned to an ever-higher baseline — so it wasn’t just the OS holding freed pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;jemalloc&lt;/code&gt; stats showed referenced memory constantly increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using rust-jemalloc-pprof we profiled memory in production and identified growth in per-connection &lt;code&gt;hyper&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;BytesMut&lt;/code&gt; buffers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we handle large uploads over variable networks, some client connections stalled mid-transfer and never cleaned up. The per-connection &lt;code&gt;hyper&lt;/code&gt; buffers (&lt;code&gt;BytesMut&lt;/code&gt;) stuck around and memory kept climbing. When we Terminated connections idle &amp;gt;10 minutes, memory dropped by ~1 GB immediately; confirming the leak was from dangling sockets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix: make sockets short-lived and enforce time limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disable keep-alive: close the connection immediately after each upload completes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tighten timeouts: set header/socket timeouts so stalled uploads are terminated and buffers are freed.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fn make_listener(addr: &amp;amp;str) -&amp;gt; std::io::Result&amp;lt;std::net::TcpListener&amp;gt; {&lt;lb/&gt;    let addr: SocketAddr = addr.parse().unwrap();&lt;lb/&gt;    let sock = Socket::new(Domain::for_address(addr), Type::STREAM, Some(Protocol::TCP))?;&lt;lb/&gt;    sock.bind(&amp;amp;addr.into())?;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;    let ka = TcpKeepalive::new()&lt;lb/&gt;        .with_time(Duration::from_secs(60))&lt;lb/&gt;        .with_interval(Duration::from_secs(15))&lt;lb/&gt;        .set_reuse_port(true)&lt;lb/&gt;        .with_retries(4);&lt;lb/&gt;    sock.set_tcp_keepalive(&amp;amp;ka)?;&lt;lb/&gt;    sock.listen(4096)?;&lt;lb/&gt;    sock.set_nonblocking(true)?; // NOTE: required before handing to Tokio&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;    Ok(sock.into())&lt;lb/&gt;}&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;pub fn create_server_external(&lt;lb/&gt;    addr_external: &amp;amp;str,&lt;lb/&gt;    rustls_config: RustlsConfig,&lt;lb/&gt;) -&amp;gt; Result&amp;lt;Server&amp;lt;RustlsAcceptor&amp;gt;, MainError&amp;gt; {&lt;lb/&gt;    let listener_external = make_listener(addr_external).map_err(|error| MainError::BindError {&lt;lb/&gt;        addr: addr_external.to_string(),&lt;lb/&gt;        error,&lt;lb/&gt;    })?;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;    let mut ext = axum_server::from_tcp_rustls(listener_external, rustls_config);&lt;lb/&gt;    ext.http_builder()&lt;lb/&gt;        .http1()&lt;lb/&gt;        .timer(TokioTimer::new())&lt;lb/&gt;        .max_buf_size(128 * 1024)&lt;lb/&gt;        .header_read_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(60)))&lt;lb/&gt;        .keep_alive(false);&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;    Ok(ext)&lt;lb/&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Storage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started with the simplest path: in-memory storage. It avoids I/O tuning and lets us use straightforward data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type Store = Arc&amp;lt;DashMap&amp;lt;Ulid, Bytes&amp;gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;pub struct VideoStore {&lt;lb/&gt;    videos: Store,&lt;lb/&gt;    bytes_used: AtomicUsize,&lt;lb/&gt;    control: Arc&amp;lt;Control&amp;gt;,&lt;lb/&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each video upload increments &lt;code&gt;bytes_used&lt;/code&gt; ; each download deletes the video and decrements it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above ~80% capacity, we start rejecting uploads to avoid OOM and signal n3-proxy to stop signing upload URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;control&lt;/code&gt; handle lets us manually pause uploads and garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Graceful Restart&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With memory-only storage, restarts must not drop in-flight data. Our graceful restart process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/code&gt;to a pod (StatefulSet rolls one pod at a time).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pod becomes Not Ready and leaves the Service (no new uploads).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It continues serving downloads for already-uploaded videos.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once downloads quiesce (no recent reads → processing drained),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wait for any open requests to complete&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restart and move to the next pod.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under normal operation pods drain in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use two cleanup mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Delete on download&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We delete videos immediately after download. In the PoC, we saw zero re-downloads; video processors retry internally. This eliminates the need to hold data or track “processed” state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TTL GC for stragglers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deleting on download doesn’t cover segments skipped by the processor (never downloaded → never deleted). We added a lightweight TTL GC: periodically scan the in-memory DashMap and remove entries older than a configurable threshold (e.g., a few hours).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Maintenance mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During planned processing downtime, we can temporarily pause GC via an internal control so videos aren’t deleted while consumption is stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 4: Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By using S3 as a fallback buffer and N3 as the primary landing zone, we eliminated ~$0.5M/year in costs while keeping the system simple and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key insight: most “build vs. buy” decisions focus on features, but at scale, economics shift the calculus. For short-lived objects (~2 seconds in normal operation), we don’t need replication or sophisticated durability; simple in-memory storage works. But when processing lags or maintenance extends object lifetime, we need S3’s reliability guarantees. We get the best of both worlds: N3 handles the happy path efficiently, while S3 provides durability when objects need to live longer. If N3 has any issues; memory pressure, pod crashes, or cluster problems; uploads seamlessly fail over to S3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Made This Work&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defining the problem clearly upfront: constraints, assumptions, and boundaries prevented scope creep. Validating early with a mirror-mode PoC let us discover bottlenecks (TLS, network throttling) and validate assumptions before committing. This prevented overengineering and backtracking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Should You Build Something Like This?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider custom infrastructure when you have both: sufficient scale for meaningful cost savings, and specific constraints that enable a simple solution. The engineering effort to build and maintain your system must be less than the infrastructure costs it eliminates. In our case, specific requirements (ephemeral storage, loss tolerance, S3 fallback) let us build something simple enough that maintenance costs stay low. Without both factors, stick with managed services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would we do it again? Yes. The system has been running reliably in production, and the fallback design lets us avoid complexity without sacrificing reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An experimental Chromium-based web browser for Android with extensions support, based on&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Helium by imput, as well as&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vanadium by GrapheneOS&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate to Chrome Web Store, then enable Desktop site by selecting the menu button ⋮ in the top right corner and ensure the option is checked. Select Okay and proceed as normal if prompted with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Chrome Web Store is only available on desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you select Add to Chrome, the extension will be installed in the background until the button changes into Remove from Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To view and access the debug URLs, use &lt;code&gt;chrome://chrome-urls&lt;/code&gt;. For Experiments, use &lt;code&gt;chrome://flags&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consistent with both Helium and Vanadium, the option is available by selecting the menu button ⋮ in the top right corner, then Settings, Privacy and security, then under Privacy, WebRTC IP handling policy. If you experience issues with WebRTC due to the IPs being shielded by default (e.g. Discord Voice), you may try to change it to Default public interface only, or Default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All builds are experimental, so unexpected issues may occur. Helium Browser for Android only attempts to improve security and privacy where possible. For better protection on Android, you should instead use GrapheneOS with Vanadium, which additionally integrates patches into Android System WebView and provides significant kernel and memory management hardening on the OS level.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The full build aims to be consistent with Helium, which means additional patches are necessary before all features can be ported over. All Vanadium patches are applied by default. Further patches are underway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This repository provides the build script to compile on the latest Ubuntu, and may also work with other Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build these releases yourself via CI (e.g. GitHub Actions), fork this repository.

    &lt;p&gt;This project would not have been possible without the huge community contributions from Helium, Vanadium, as well as ungoogled-chromium and various other upstream projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All credit goes to the original authors and contributors. This project is named to reflect support for Helium's naming in a recent controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I turned Zig into my favorite language to write network programs in&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been watching the Zig language for a while now, given that it was created for writing audio software (low-level, no allocations, real time). I never paid too much attention though, it seemed a little weird to me and I didn’t see the real need. Then I saw a post from Andrew Kelley (creator of the language) on Hacker News, about how he reimplemented my Chromaprint algorithm in Zig, and that got me really interested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been planning to rewrite AcoustID’s inverted index for a long time, I had a couple of prototypes, but none of the approaches felt right. I was going through some rough times, wanted to learn something new, so I decided to use the project as an opportunity to learn Zig. And it was great, writing Zig is a joy. The new version was faster and more scalable than the previous C++ one. I was happy, until I wanted to add a server interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the previous C++ version, I used Qt, which might seem very strange for a server software, but I wanted a nice way of doing asynchronous I/O and Qt allowed me to do that. It was callback-based, but Qt has a lot of support for making callbacks usable. In the newer prototypes, I used Go, specifically for the ease of networking and concurrency. With Zig, I was stuck. There are some Zig HTTP servers, so I could use those. I wanted to implement my legacy TCP server as well, and that’s a lot harder, unless I want to spawn a lot of threads. Then I made a crazy decision, to use Zig also for implementing a clustered layer on top of my server, using NATS as a messaging system, so I wrote a Zig NATS client, and that gave me a lot of experience with Zig’s networking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, I’m happy to introduce Zio, an asynchronous I/O and concurrency library for Zig. If you look at the examples, you will not really see where is the asynchronous I/O, but it’s there, in the background and that’s the point. Writing asynchronous code with callbacks is a pain. Not only that, it requires a lot of allocations, because you need state to survive across callbacks. Zio is an implementation of Go style concurrency, but limited to what’s possible in Zig. Zio tasks are stackful coroutines with fixed-size stacks. When you run &lt;code&gt;stream.read()&lt;/code&gt;, this will initiate the I/O operation in the background
and then suspend the current task until the I/O operation is done. When it’s done, the task will be resumed, and the result will be returned.
That gives you the illusion of synchronous code, allowing for much simpler state management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zio support fully asynchronous network and file I/O, has synchronization primitives (mutexes, condition variables, etc.) that work with the cooperative runtime, has Go-style channels, OS signal watches and more. Tasks can run in single-threaded mode, or multi-threaded, in which case they can migrate from thread to thread for lower latency and better load balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it’s FAST. I don’t want to be posting benchmarks here, maybe later when I have more complex ones, but the single-threaded mode is beating any framework I’ve tried so far. It’s much faster than both Go and Rust’s Tokio. Context switching is virtually free, comparable to a function call. The multi-threaded mode, while still not being as robust as Go/Tokio, has comparable performance. It’s still a bit faster than either of them, but that performance might go down as I add more fairness features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it implements the standard interfaces for reader/writer, you can actually use external libraries that are unaware they are running within Zio. Here is an example of a HTTP server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
const zio = @import("zio");

const MAX_REQUEST_HEADER_SIZE = 64 * 1024;

fn connectionTask(rt: *zio.Runtime, stream: zio.net.Stream) !void {
    defer stream.close(rt);

    var read_buffer: [MAX_REQUEST_HEADER_SIZE]u8 = undefined;
    var reader = stream.reader(rt, &amp;amp;read_buffer);

    var write_buffer: [4096]u8 = undefined;
    var writer = stream.writer(rt, &amp;amp;write_buffer);

    var server = std.http.Server.init(
        &amp;amp;reader.interface,
        &amp;amp;writer.interface,
    );

    while (true) {
        var request = try server.receiveHead();
        try request.respond("hello", .{ .status = .ok });

        if (!request.head.keep_alive) break;
    }
}

fn serverTask(rt: *zio.Runtime) !void {
    const addr = try zio.net.IpAddress.parse("127.0.0.1", 8080);

    const server = try addr.listen(rt, .{});
    defer server.close(rt);

    while (true) {
        const stream = try server.accept(rt);
        errdefer stream.close(rt);

        var task = try rt.spawn(
            connectionTask, .{ rt, stream }, .{}
        );
        task.deinit();
    }
}

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var runtime = try zio.Runtime.init(allocator, .{});
    defer runtime.deinit();

    try runtime.runUntilComplete(serverTask, .{&amp;amp;runtime}, .{});
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started working with Zig, I really thought it’s going to be a niche language to write the fast code in, and then I’ll need a layer on top of that in a different language. With Zio, that changed. The next step for me is to update my NATS client to use Zio internally. And after that, I’m going to work on a HTTP client/server library based on Zio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;ICE Will Use AI to Surveil Social Media&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Silicon Valley firm has contracted with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to build out a social media surveillance dragnet. Critics say that the AI-driven software will target immigrants for political speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immigration and Customs Enforcement has inked a new $5.7 million contract for AI-driven social media surveillance software, according to federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. It’s the latest move in the agency’s ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The five-year contract with government technology middleman Carahsoft Technology, made public in September, provides Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) licenses for a product called Zignal Labs, a social media monitoring platform used by the Israeli military and the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An informational pamphlet marked confidential but publicly available online advertises that Zignal Labs “leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning” to analyze over eight billion social media posts per day, providing “curated detection feeds” for its clients. The information, the company says, allows law enforcement to “detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency, has in the past procured Zignal licenses for the US Secret Service, signing its first contract for the software in 2019. The company also has contracts with the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the September notice appears to be the first indication that ICE has access to the platform. The licenses will be provided to Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s intelligence unit, to provide “real-time data analysis for criminal investigations,” per the disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zignal joins ICE’s growing arsenal of social media surveillance tools, many of which employ artificial intelligence to generate leads and identify “threats” from vast quantities of online data. These tools pose a particular threat as ICE, under the Trump administration, appears to be increasingly using social media to direct its immigration enforcement strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several pro-Palestinian activists, including Mahmoud Khalil, were targeted and jailed by immigration authorities after being doxed online by right-wing, pro-Israel blacklist websites like Canary Mission. Just this week, immigration agents raided street vendors in New York City after a right-wing influencer posted a video of the block online, demanding action by authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government’s growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities. As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advocates told The Lever that ICE’s purchase of Zignal Labs licenses, like its other uses of digital surveillance tech, raises civil liberty concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“[The Department of Homeland Security] should not be buying surveillance tools that scrape our social media posts off the internet and then use AI to scrutinize our online speech,” said Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “And agencies certainly shouldn’t be deploying this kind of black box technology in secret without any accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;“Tactical Intelligence” to Israel and the Pentagon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zignal Labs, founded in Silicon Valley in 2011, initially catered to public relations firms and political campaigns, advertising data analytics and media monitoring to help identify and respond to narrative trends online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But like the many private companies that now provide digital surveillance tools to the federal government, Zignal Labs soon moved into the defense and intelligence industries, formally announcing the new focus, along with a “public sector advisory board” staffed by industry veterans, in 2021. One Zignal pamphlet from this year advertises the company’s work with the Israeli military, saying its data analytics platform provides “tactical intelligence” to “operators on the ground” in Gaza. The pamphlet also highlights Zignal’s work with the US Marines and the State Department.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zignal Labs did not return a request for comment about its work with Israeli forces or its new contract with ICE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The unions’ lawsuit over the Trump administration’s use of social media surveillance details the myriad digital surveillance tools that ICE already has at its disposal, including ShadowDragon, a software that uses publicly available websites to map out an individual’s online activity, and Babel X, which links social media profiles and location information to a target’s Social Security number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’ve been seeing an uptick in ICE surveillance contracts,” said Julie Mao, an attorney with Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group that closely monitors ICE’s surveillance regime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week, ICE signed a $7 million contract with the firm SOS International LLC, for “skip tracing services,” a term that refers to tracking a person’s whereabouts, per federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. The multimillion-dollar contract comes just three months after SOS International LLC, which also does business as SOSi, announced that the company had hired Andre Watson, an ICE Homeland Security Investigations intelligence chief, to “expand [the company’s] business and deliver capabilities to state and federal law enforcement agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these services tout that their surveillance capabilities are enhanced by artificial intelligence, including Zignal. In a July post announcing the latter company’s partnership with Carahsoft Technology, Zignal’s CEO boasted that the latest iteration of the software used AI to scour global digital data, “helping defense and intelligence teams detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.” Two months after this announcement, ICE signed its new contract with Carahsoft for Zignal licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ICE’s use of AI to surveil vast swathes of the internet in real time presents serious privacy and free speech concerns, the labor unions argued in their lawsuit against the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The government’s utilization of AI and automated tools for viewpoint-driven online surveillance gives teeth to its threat to surveil ‘everyone’ online for disfavored expression,” attorneys with the civil liberties group the Electronic Freedom Foundation and Yale Law School’s Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic wrote in the complaint, saying that such tools “exacerbate the chilling impact of that surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August 20th, 2011: Marc Andreessen proclaims ‘Software is eating the world.’ That was over ten years ago. Today, software is still eating the world, but this is no longer a groundbreaking proclamation nor a surprise to anyone. In the years that followed, software would become integral to our daily lives, business, and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I learned and continue to learn more about computer science through my degrees, I am constantly reminded of times gone by. I had professors who had lived through the rise of computer science; who invented network systems ground up, pioneered research in their fields and had advisors from the previous generation who invented modern systems that we know today. I am reminded of a golden age of CS and software engineering, where founders and academics would bump into each other in the Bay Area and create the next big thing seemingly on a whim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I met people and friends who had gone to work for their dream companies - the Microsofts, Apples, Googles, and those people who made six figures out of college. I had heard legends (for lack of a better term) of the geniuses; the students who made such a difference in school and then went on to pursue their dreams and have a steady career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, all of this seems gone these days. In my final term of college, I can’t help but feel a longing for the days where software was eating the world. I feel as if I would’ve thrived, would’ve innovated, and would’ve had more fun. I feel like my experience would have been worth more then, but now it’s worth hardly anything in a changing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What do you do when it’s no longer fun?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve said my story a few times in different writings, but I started programming with Minecraft during my adolescent years. I learned Java and OOP before I had even learned algebra. I had learned worst-case behavior and programmatic/problem solving thinking before I had really started a sport. The struggle of solving a problem; of debugging, of failing, and eventually succeeding always made it worth it for me again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love writing code. It’s like writing in general, or it’s like a creative art. You tweak it, revise it, pay attention to detail a thousand times. You keep on working at it and iterating on it until it’s just right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if anyone else feels this way, but with the introduction of generative AI, I don’t find coding fun anymore. It’s hard to motivate myself to code knowing that a model can do it much quicker. The joy of coding for me was literally the process of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, AI is eating the world. You can’t hardly go to a website without seeing AI 15 times in the marketing, or having an AI support chatbot pop up. You can’t hardly have a conversation with someone without hearing about it. The companies I dreamed of working for now have mandatory AI policies, or else you’ll be on the chopping block.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Altogether, it feels like I’m suspended in motion. All I can do is sit and watch while the irreversible effects of AI grow, time is passing, and more innovation is happening. Some software engineers are embracing it. Some software engineers are actively working towards a future where their own jobs will be taken by AI. Some of us just have to roll with the sunk costs on degrees that were made for a different time and get a job anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re faced with harder questions now than in the time where things were just built; I wonder if there will be a world where people must choose to opt in or out of AI usage in their jobs; or if there will be the same banners per website like we get with cookies. Or, if it will continue steamrolling, or rather stagnate in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How will macroeconomics and government policy get involved? (Bernie has a rather gloomy talk on this) I think that they will need to get involved, sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all of us that grew up enjoying the coding process: we might just be in the wrong moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
