    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;ð¼ï¸ Stop Shipping PNGs In Your Games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you shipping textures to players as PNGs? The goal of this post is to convince you that this is suboptimal, and walk you through a better approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâll also share my implementation of the suggested approach, but if youâd rather do it yourself Iâll also provide you with the information you need to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If youâre using a game engine, it is almost certainly doing what this post suggests automatically, but it doesnât hurt to double check!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Whatâs wrong with PNGs?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PNGs are great for interchange. Theyâre lossless, they compresses well, and support is ubiquitous. PNG is my image interchange format of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post isnât a criticism of PNGsâitâs just that the PNG format is designed for image data, not texture data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of features you would expect out of a texture format that youâre not going to find in an image format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pregenerated mipmaps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cubemaps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Premultiplied alpha&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Technically PNGs can be premultplied, but yours probably arenât.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can you work around all these issues? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can premultiply and generate your mipmaps at load time. You can ship separate images for each cuebmap face. But now youâre resigned to cheap mipmap generation, and cubemaps that are difficult to downsample correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can certainly make it work, but youâre making things unnecessarily difficult for yourself by using the wrong tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, texture formats have a killer feature not mentioned aboveâsupport for GPU compatible texture compression like BCn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An in-depth explanation of GPU compression formats it out of scope for this post, but at a high level, these formats store each block of pixels as a couple of endpoints and a method for interpolating between those endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This trades mild degradation of image quality for improvements in storage, VRAM usage, and sampling performance. Itâs so good it feels like youâre cheating thermodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPUs canât decompress PNGs on the fly, so as a result, if you ship PNGs you either canât take advantage of this compression, or you have to first decompress the PNGs and then do an extremely expensive compression step to convert to the desired block based format every time a player loads the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs a little goofy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(EDIT: Well, itâs goofy when done naivelyâsee discussion w/ Ignacio CastaÃ±o here, something along these lines can become viable if you can transcode quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What texture formats are out there?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Texture formats like Khronosâ KTX2 and Microsoftâs DDS are designed for exactly our use case. Theyâre just headers followed by some image data that you can upload directly to the GPU without any additional processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, unless you use supercompression. GPU compression formats donât provide great compression ratios, so itâs typical to apply lossless compression as well (think zlib or lz4.) In that case youâll decompress, and then upload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The meta here is to design your lossy compressor to be aware that its output is going to be losslessly compressed afterwards. This lets it make decisions that reduce entropy, improving the effectiveness of the lossless step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used DXT5 + lz4 compressed DDS files for Way of Rhea, Iâm switching to BC7 + zlib compressed KTX2 files for my next game. Both approaches are reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: I primarily develop games for desktop platforms. IIUC, on mobile, hardware support for various types of GPU compression varies but the formats are similar-ish, so the meta is to use something like Basis Universal to quickly transcode to the correct format on load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Exporting to KTX2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, youâre likely looking through the export menu of your image editor of choice for KTX2 and DDS, and not seeing any results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, AFAICT most people end up rolling their own exporters. People used to use Nvidia Texture Tools, but itâs archived as there wasnât funding to maintain it. Itâs still a great reference. Nvidia has a closed source fork, but I donât love having a closed source dependency for such an integral part of my engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve implemented an open source texture tool that youâre welcome to use directly or as a reference for your own implementation: Zex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be used as a command line tool, or as a Zig library. It reads PNGs using stb_image, and converts them to KTX2, with support BC7 compression + rate distortion optimization from bc7enc_rdo, and supercompression via zlib.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It supports most standard features, such as mipmap generation with configurable filters and address modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I havenât implemented cubemap exports yet as my current game isnât using them. If you need support before I get around to it, PRs are welcomeâit should be a pretty straightforward addition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to implement your own exporter, here are some useful references. Keep in mind that you donât need to support all possible features, just the ones your engine uses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Texture Viewers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most image viewers wonât be able to open texture formats like DDS/KTX2. This sorta makes senseâimage viewers are typically designed to show a single image, whereas a texture may be comprised of multiple mipmaps and cubemap faces and such, and may be HDR. This requires a fancier UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâm personally a fan of Tacentview for this use case. Itâs open source, cross platform, and supports a large number of formats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preserving Alpha Coverage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;source: firewatch inspired me so I made a tree and then never used it for anything&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pregenerating your mipmaps gives you a chance to be a little more âcorrectâ about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if youâve ever tried to render a tree or a chain link fence in-game as a cutout (or with alpha to coverage) but found that it vanishes when you get far away, your mipmap filtering likely isnât taking into account the alpha test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see Zexâs alpha test aware resize here. This isnât battle tested yet, compare results visually in-engine to see if it provides a benefit for your artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Automation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You probably donât want to convert all your images by hand. I did this for Way of Rhea for a while, but eventually realized that it was a waste of time. Every time a texture changes you have to go back and figure out what settings you used last time. Just automate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâll probably write a follow up post describing my strategy for automating this at some point in the future, but if you want a sneak peak, check out Oven. Itâs not exactly general purpose right now, but might be an interesting reference.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The noted Diné (Navajo) weaver Marilou Schultz recently completed an intricate weaving composed of thick white lines on a black background, punctuated with reddish-orange diamonds. Although this striking rug may appear abstract, it shows the internal circuitry of a tiny silicon chip known as the 555 timer. This chip has hundreds of applications in everything from a sound generator to a windshield wiper controller. At one point, the 555 was the world's best-selling integrated circuit with billions sold. But how did the chip get turned into a rug?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 555 chip is constructed from a tiny flake of silicon with a layer of metallic wiring on top. In the rug, this wiring is visible as the thick white lines, while the silicon forms the black background. One conspicuous feature of the rug is the reddish-orange diamonds around the perimeter. These correspond to the connections between the silicon chip and its eight pins. Tiny golden bond wires—thinner than a human hair—are attached to the square bond pads to provide these connections. The circuitry of the 555 chip contains 25 transistors, silicon devices that can switch on and off. The rug is dominated by three large transistors, the filled squares with a 王 pattern inside, while the remaining transistors are represented by small dots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The weaving was inspired by a photo of the 555 timer die taken by Antoine Bercovici (Siliconinsider); I suggested this photo to Schultz as a possible subject for a rug. The diagram below compares the weaving (left) with the die photo (right). As you can see, the weaving closely follows the actual chip, but there are a few artistic differences. For instance, two of the bond pads have been removed, the circuitry at the top has been simplified, and the part number at the bottom has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Antoine took the die photo with a dark field microscope, a special type of microscope that produces an image on a black background. This image emphasizes the metal layer on the top of the die. In comparison, a standard bright-field microscope produced the image below. When a chip is manufactured, regions of silicon are "doped" with impurities to create transistors and resistors. These regions are visible in the image below as subtle changes in the color of the silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the weaving, the chip's design appears almost monumental, making it easy to forget that the actual chip is microscopic. For the photo below, I obtained a version of the chip packaged in a metal can, rather than the typical rectangle of black plastic. Cutting the top off the metal can reveals the tiny chip inside, with eight gold bond wires connecting the die to the pins of the package. If you zoom in on the photo, you may recognize the three large transistors that dominate the rug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The artist, Marilou Schultz, has been creating chip rugs since 1994, when Intel commissioned a rug based on the Pentium as a gift to AISES (American Indian Science &amp;amp; Engineering Society). Although Schultz learned weaving as a child, the Pentium rug was a challenge due to its complex pattern and lack of symmetry; a day's work might add just an inch to the rug. This dramatic weaving was created with wool from the long-horned Navajo-Churro sheep, colored with traditional plant dyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the 555 timer weaving, Schultz experimented with different materials. Silver and gold metallic threads represent the aluminum and copper in the chip. The artist explains that "it took a lot more time to incorporate the metallic threads," but it was worth the effort because "it is spectacular to see the rug with the metallics in the dark with a little light hitting it." Aniline dyes provided the black and lavender colors. Although natural logwood dye produces a beautiful purple, it fades over time, so Schultz used an aniline dye instead. The lavender colors are dedicated to the weaver's mother, who passed away in February; purple was her favorite color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inside the chip&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the 555 chip produce a particular time delay? You add external components—resistors and a capacitor—to select the time. The capacitor is filled (charged) at a speed controlled by the resistor. When the capacitor get "full", the 555 chip switches operation and starts emptying (discharging) the capacitor. It's like filling a sink: if you have a large sink (capacitor) and a trickle of water (large resistor), the sink fills slowly. But if you have a smal sink (capacitor) and a lot of water (small resistor), the sink fills quickly. By using different resistors and capacitors, the 555 timer can provide time intervals from microseconds to hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've constructed an interactive chip browser that shows how the regions of the rug correspond to specific electronic components in the physical chip. Click on any part of the rug to learn the function of the corresponding component in the chip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, two of the large square transistors turn the chip's output on or off, while the third large transistor discharges the capacitor when it is full. (To be precise, the capacitor goes between 1/3 full and 2/3 full to avoid issues near "empty" and "full".) The chip has circuits called comparators that detect when the capacitor's voltage reaches 1/3 or 2/3, switching between emptying and filling at those points. If you want more technical details about the 555 chip, see my previous articles: an early 555 chip, a 555 timer similar to the rug, and a more modern CMOS version of the 555.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The similarities between Navajo weavings and the patterns in integrated circuits have long been recognized. Marilou Schultz's weavings of integrated circuits make these visual metaphors into concrete works of art. This connection is not just metaphorical, however; in the 1960s, the semiconductor company Fairchild employed numerous Navajo workers to assemble chips in Shiprock, New Mexico. I wrote about this complicated history in The Pentium as a Navajo Weaving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work is being shown at SITE Santa Fe's Once Within a Time exhibition (running until January 2026). I haven't seen the exhibition in person, so let me know if you visit it.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did MVC get so F’ed up?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smalltalk MVC is defined in Design Pattern as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;MVC Consists of three kinds of objects. The Model is the application object, the View is its screen presentation, and the Controller defines the way the user interface reacts to user input.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However this definition has been abused over the years - Back in 2003 I gave a talk citing how bad Apple’s definition was. At the time it stated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A view object knows how to display and possibly edit data from the application’s model… A controller object acts as the intermediary between the application’s view objects and its model objects… Controllers are often the least reusable objects in an application, but that’s acceptable…2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course it isn’t acceptable and, over the years, Apple has refined their definition and now acknowledge the distinction between the traditional Smalltalk version of MVC and the Cocoa version.3 But the Cocoa version is still defined much as it was before:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A view object knows how to display, and might allow users to edit, the data from the application’s model… A controller object acts as the intermediary between the application’s view objects and its model objects…3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In looking at how iOS applications are written the sentiment that controllers (and now view-controllers) are often the least reusable components in an application still flourishes, even if it is now unstated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MVC (I’ll always use that term to refer to the Smalltalk form) has the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; figure: Smalltalk MVC4 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the solid lines imply a direct association. And the dashed lines an indirect association by an observer. So what we see is that the model is unaware of the view and controller, except indirectly through notifications, and hence the code in the Model is reusable. The controller and view bind to the model, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often the function of the Controller and View are tightly coupled into a “widget” or “control”. When Apple talks about a View-Controller in their model they are talking about a grab-bag of an uber-widget that is a composite of UIView widgets and multiple models. From what I’ve seen, including in Apple’s example code, it is usually a pretty big mess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key to getting MVC correct is understanding what models are. A model is simply an object5 which can be observed (a requirement for attaching views). For example, in ObjC an int is an object, but it is not observable. However, an ObjC object with an int property is observable using Key-Value Observing6. A model may encapsulate complex relationships between the model’s properties. A trivial model is one where each property is completely independent (think C struct vs. C++ class). From a notification the view should be able to determine, at a minimum:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What changed. It may be as simple as “the model bound to the view”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new value to display.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say our model is a trivial observable boolean (I can’t imagine a simpler model). What we want is a checkbox that binds to the observable boolean. When the controller requests a change in value, the boolean is updated, and the view is notified of the new state of the model. The model is unaware of what UI is attached to it, and in fact there could be multiple UIs, including something like a scripting system, attached to the same instance of the model. This is a form of data binding - though most data binding systems replicate the problems of their underlying widget set by treating the model as if it were observing the view, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrast this with most UI frameworks where you have a checkbox widget from which you can query the value and you receive a notification when the value has changed. This is pushing a model into the widget. With MVC you never ask a question like “what is the default state of this checkbox?” - the default state of the view is always the current state of the model. You would also never get the state of the checkbox - the state of the checkbox is simply a reflection of the state of the model. In a system where you get the state of a checkbox you are binding two models together by treating one as a view/controller of the other. Such a pattern doesn’t scale beyond trivial models, and even for those it introduces some ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I conjecture that one of the reasons why MVC has been so screwed up is because, unlike in Smalltalk, writing something as simple as an observable boolean is a bit of a pain in a language like Pascal or C. You quickly get into object ownership and lifetime issues and how to write bind expressions. If one also assumes that you have a 1:1 mapping from UI to model then there is some inherent inefficiency in the generalization. The Lisa team made some major compromises and the rest of the industry followed along.7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To support more complex views, the notification may need to specify what parts of the model changed and how those parts changed. For example, “image 58 was removed from the sequence”. A complete model is one that can support any view of that model type efficiently (related to the notion of a complete type and a type’s efficient basis).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One additional attribute of MVC is that it is a composite pattern. This is hinted at by the direct connection between the Controller and the View. As I said early, the view may contain state, this state is itself an object, and because this state is also displayed within the view it is observable. It is another model. I refers to this as the view’s model. This model may include things such as the visibility of a window, the tab the user was last looking at, and the portion of the model being viewed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying what the models are in your system is important. We usually do pretty good at identifying the major models. Such as “this is an image” - but often fall short of identifying the complete model, i.e. “this is an image with a collection of settings.” We end up with our model spread out within the code (an incidental type) and it makes it more difficult to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common model that is often completely overlooked is the model for function arguments. When you have a command, button, gesture, or menu item in your application, these are bound to a function. The function itself is not typically a zeroary function but rather has a set of arguments that are constructed through other parts of the UI. For example, if I have a list of images in my application, I might have a button to delete the selected images. Here the current selection is the argument to my delete command. To create a UI for the selection I must create a model of the arguments to my function. A precondition of delete is that the selection is not empty. This precondition must be observable in the argument model so it can be reflected in the view by disabling or hiding the button and in the controller be disallowing the user to click the button and issue the command. The same argument model can be shared for multiple commands within an application.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Microdot web framework is quite small, as its name would imply; it supports both standard CPython and MicroPython, so it can be used on systems ranging from internet-of-things (IoT) devices all the way up to large, cloudy servers. It was developed by Miguel Grinberg, who gave a presentation about it at EuroPython 2025. His name may sound familiar from his well-known Flask Mega-Tutorial, which has introduced many to the Flask lightweight Python-based web framework. It should come as no surprise, then, that Microdot is inspired by its rather larger cousin, so Flask enthusiasts will find much to like in Microdot—and will come up to speed quickly should their needs turn toward smaller systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have looked at various pieces of this software stack along the way: Microdot itself in January 2024, MicroPython in 2023, and Flask as part of a look at Python microframeworks in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Grinberg began his talk with an introduction. He has been living in Ireland for a few years and "&lt;quote&gt;I make stuff&lt;/quote&gt;". That includes open-source projects, blog posts (on a Flask-based blog platform that he wrote), and "&lt;quote&gt;a bunch of books&lt;/quote&gt;". He works for Elastic and is one of the maintainers of the Elasticsearch Python client, "&lt;quote&gt;so maybe you have used some of the things that I made for money&lt;/quote&gt;". &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; With a chuckle, he asked: "&lt;quote&gt;Why do we need another web framework? We have so many already.&lt;/quote&gt;" The story starts with a move that he made to Ireland from the US in 2018; he rented a house with a "smart" heating controller and was excited to use it. There were two thermostats, one for each level of the house, and he was "&lt;quote&gt;really looking forward to the winter&lt;/quote&gt;" to see the system in action. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; As might be guessed, he could set target temperatures in each thermostat; they would communicate with the controller that would turn the heating on and off as needed. In addition, the system had a web server that could be used to query various parameters or to start and stop the heaters. You could even send commands via SMS text messages; "&lt;quote&gt;there's a SIM card somewhere in that box [...] very exciting stuff&lt;/quote&gt;". &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; When winter rolled around, it did not work that well, however; sometimes the house was too chilly or warm and he had to start and stop the heaters himself. He did some debugging and found that the thermostats were reporting temperatures that were off by ±3°C, "&lt;quote&gt;which is too much for trying to keep the house at 20°&lt;/quote&gt;". The owner of the house thought that he was too used to the US where things just work; "&lt;quote&gt;at least she thinks that in America everything is super-efficient, everything works, and she thought 'this is the way things work in Ireland'&lt;/quote&gt;". So he did not make any progress with the owner. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; At that point, most people would probably just give up and live with the problem; "&lt;quote&gt;I hacked my heating controller instead&lt;/quote&gt;". He set the temperatures in both thermostats to zero, which effectively disabled their ability to affect the heaters at all, and built two small boards running MicroPython, each connected to a temperature and humidity sensor device. He wrote code that would check the temperature every five minutes and send the appropriate commands to start or stop the heaters based on what it found. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; So the second half of his first winter in Ireland went great. The sensors are accurate to ±0.5°C, so "&lt;quote&gt;problem solved&lt;/quote&gt;". But, that led to a new problem for him. "&lt;quote&gt;I wanted to know things: What's the temperature right now? Is the heating running right now or not? How many hours did it run today compared to yesterday?&lt;/quote&gt;" And so on. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He added a small LCD screen to display some information, but he had to actually go to the device and look at it; what he really wanted was to be able to talk to the device over WiFi and get information from the couch while he was watching TV. "&lt;quote&gt;I wanted to host a web server [...] that will show me a little dashboard&lt;/quote&gt;". &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; So he searched for web frameworks for MicroPython; in the winter of 2018-2019, "&lt;quote&gt;there were none&lt;/quote&gt;". Neither Flask nor Bottle, which is a good bit smaller, would run on MicroPython; both are too large for the devices, but, in addition, the standard library for MicroPython is a subset of that of CPython, so many things that they need are missing. A "&lt;quote&gt;normal person&lt;/quote&gt;" would likely have just accepted that and moved on; "&lt;quote&gt;I created a web framework instead.&lt;/quote&gt;" &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Demo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He brought one of his thermostat devices to Prague for the conference and did a small demonstration of it operating during the talk. The device was connected to his laptop using USB, which provided power, but also a serial connection to the board. On the laptop, he used the rshell remote MicroPython shell to talk to the board, effectively using the laptop as a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He started the MicroPython read-eval-print loop (REPL) on the board in order to simulate the normal operation of the board. When it is plugged into the wall, rather than a laptop, it will boot to the web server, so he made that happen with a soft-reboot command. The device then connected to the conference WiFi and gave him the IP address (and port) where the server was running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He switched over to Firefox on his laptop and visited the site, which showed a dashboard that had the current temperature (24.4°) and relative humidity (56.9%) of the room. He also used curl from the laptop to contact the api endpoint of the web application, which returned JSON with the two values and the time. There is no persistent clock on the board, so the application contacts an NTP server to pick up the time when it boots; that allows it to report the last time a measurement was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Grinberg said that he wanted to set the expectations at the right level by looking at the capabilities of the microcontrollers he often uses with Microdot. For example, the ESP8266 in his thermostat device has 64KB of RAM and up to 4MB of flash. The ESP8266 is the smallest and least expensive (around €5) device with WiFi that he has found; there are many even smaller devices, but they lack the networking required for running a web server. The other devices he uses are the Raspberry Pi Pico W with 2MB of flash and 256KB of RAM and the ESP32 with up to 8MB of flash and 512KB of RAM. He contrasted those with his laptop, which has 32GB of RAM, so "&lt;quote&gt;you need 500,000 ESP8266s&lt;/quote&gt;" to have the same amount of memory. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core framework of Microdot is in a single microdot.py file. It is fully asynchronous, using the MicroPython subset of the CPython asyncio module, so it can run on both interpreters. It uses asyncio because that is the only way to do concurrency on the microcontrollers; there is no support for processes or threads on those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microdot has Flask-style route decorators to define URLs for the application. It has Request and Response classes, as well as hooks to run before and after requests, he said. Handling query strings, form data, and JSON are all available in Microdot via normal Python dictionaries. Importantly, it can handle streaming requests and responses; because of the limited memory of these devices, it may be necessary to split up the handling of larger requests or responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; It supports setting cookies and sending static files. Web applications can be constructed from a set of modules, using sub-applications, which are similar to Flask blueprints. It also has its own web server with TLS support. "&lt;quote&gt;I'm very proud of all the stuff I was able to fit in the core Microdot framework&lt;/quote&gt;", Grinberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He hoped that attendees would have to think for a minute to come up with things that are missing from Microdot, but they definitely do exist. There are some officially maintained extensions, each in its own single .py file, to fill some of those holes. They encompass functionality that is important, but he did not want to add to the core because that would make it too large to fit on the low-end ESP8266 that he is using.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; There is an extension for multipart forms, which includes file uploads; "&lt;quote&gt;this is extremely complicated to parse, it didn't make sense to add it into the core because most people don't do this&lt;/quote&gt;". There is support for WebSocket and server-sent events (SSE). Templates are supported using utemplate for both Python implementations or Jinja, which only works on CPython. There are extensions for basic and token-based authentication and for secure user logins with session data; the latter required a replacement for the CPython-only PyJWT, which Grinberg wrote and contributed to MicroPython as jwt.py. There is a small handful of other extensions that he quickly mentioned as well. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; "&lt;quote&gt;I consider the documentation as part of the framework&lt;/quote&gt;"; he is "&lt;quote&gt;kind of fanatical&lt;/quote&gt;" about documenting everything. If there is something missing or not explained well, "&lt;quote&gt;it's a bug that I need to fix&lt;/quote&gt;". He writes books, so the documentation is organized similarly; it comes in at 9,267 words, which equates to around 47 minutes of reading time. There is 100% test coverage, he said, and there are around 30 examples, with more coming. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; A design principle that he follows is "&lt;quote&gt;no dark magic&lt;/quote&gt;". An example of dark magic to him is the Flask application context, "&lt;quote&gt;which very few people understand&lt;/quote&gt;". In Microdot, the request object is explicitly passed to each route function. Another example is the dependency injection that is used by the FastAPI framework to add components; Microdot uses explicit decorators instead. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He used the cloc utility to count lines of code, while ignoring comments and blank lines. Using that, Django comes in at 110,000 lines, Flask plus its essential Werkzeug library is 15,500 lines, FastAPI with Starlette is 14,900 lines, Bottle is around 3,000 lines, while the Microdot core has 765 lines ("&lt;quote&gt;believe it or not&lt;/quote&gt;") and a full install with all the extensions on MicroPython comes in at just shy of 1,700 lines of code. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He ended with an example of how Microdot can be so small by comparing the URL matching in Flask with Microdot. The Flask version does lots more than Microdot, with more supported types of arguments in a URL and multiple classes in the werkzeug.routing module; it has 1,362 lines of code. For Microdot, there is a more limited set of URL arguments, though there is still the ability to define custom types, and a single URLPattern class; all of that is done in 63 lines of code. "&lt;quote&gt;I don't intend to support everything that Flask supports, in terms of routing, but I intend to support the 20% that covers 80% of the use cases.&lt;/quote&gt;" That is the overall mechanism that he has used to get to something that is so small. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An audience member asked about whether the Microdot code was minified in order to get it to fit. Grinberg said that doing so was not all that useful for MicroPython, but the code is smaller on the board because it is precompiled on another system; that results in a microdot.mpy file, which is bytecode for MicroPython. For example, on the low-end device he is using for his thermostats, Microdot would not be able to be compiled on the device itself. There are some other tricks that can also be used for reducing the RAM requirements, like putting the code into the firmware as part of the MicroPython binary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The final question was about performance, and how many requests per second could be handled. Grinberg said that he did not have any real numbers, but that the device he demonstrated is "&lt;quote&gt;really really slow&lt;/quote&gt;". That question led to a blog post in late July where Grinberg tried to more fully answer it. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Posted Aug 23, 2025 15:26 UTC (Sat) by lyda (subscriber, #7429) [Link] (1 responses) When I wrote a lot of python, frameworks like this seemed great. But there's a better way. If you define the OpenAPI definition first, you can then generate the server, you can generate all the clients, you can generate tests for the server and client, as well as fuzz tests for the server. Less common, but you can do the same with gRPC. It also allows you to more easily move from one technology to another. Posted Aug 24, 2025 3:10 UTC (Sun) by ssmith32 (subscriber, #72404) [Link] Certainly not for the problem domain covered in the article. &lt;head&gt;OpenAPI or gRPC is a better path forward&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;OpenAPI or gRPC is a better path forward&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The craft of programming is almost universally concerned with different types of data and operations/algorithms that act on this data [1]. Therefore, it's hardly surprising that designing abstractions for data types and operations has been on the mind of software engineers and programming-language designers since... forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet I've only recently encountered a name for a software design problem which I ran into multiple times in my career. It's a problem so fundamental that I was quite surprised that I haven't seen it named before. Here is a quick problem statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine that we have a set of data types and a set of operations that act on these types. Sometimes we need to add more operations and make sure they work properly on all types; sometimes we need to add more types and make sure all operations work properly on them. Sometimes, however, we need to add both - and herein lies the problem. Most of the mainstream programming languages don't provide good tools to add both new types and new operations to an existing system without having to change existing code. This is called the "expression problem". Studying the problem and its possible solutions gives great insight into the fundamental differences between object-oriented and functional programming and well as concepts like interfaces and multiple dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A motivating example&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is my wont, my example comes from the world of compilers and interpreters. To my defense, this is also the example used in some of the seminal historic sources on the expression problem, as the historical perspective section below details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine we're designing a simple expression evaluator. Following the standard interpreter design pattern, we have a tree structure consisting of expressions, with some operations we can do on such trees. In C++ we'd have an interface every node in the expression tree would have to implement:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Expr {
public:
  virtual std::string ToString() const = 0;
  virtual double Eval() const = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This interface shows that we currently have two operations we can do on expression trees - evaluate them and query for their string representations. A typical leaf node expression:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Constant : public Expr {
public:
  Constant(double value) : value_(value) {}

  std::string ToString() const {
    std::ostringstream ss;
    ss &amp;lt;&amp;lt; value_;
    return ss.str();
  }

  double Eval() const {
    return value_;
  }

private:
  double value_;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And a typical composite expression:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class BinaryPlus : public Expr {
public:
  BinaryPlus(const Expr&amp;amp; lhs, const Expr&amp;amp; rhs) : lhs_(lhs), rhs_(rhs) {}

  std::string ToString() const {
    return lhs_.ToString() + " + " + rhs_.ToString();
  }

  double Eval() const {
    return lhs_.Eval() + rhs_.Eval();
  }

private:
  const Expr&amp;amp; lhs_;
  const Expr&amp;amp; rhs_;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, it's all fairly basic stuff. How extensible is this design? Let's see... if we want to add new expression types ("variable reference", "function call" etc.), that's pretty easy. We just define additional classes inheriting from Expr and implement the Expr interface (ToString and Eval).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, what happens if we want to add new operations that can be applied to expression trees? Right now we have Eval and ToString, but we may want additional operations like "type check" or "serialize" or "compile to machine code" or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that adding new operations isn't as easy as adding new types. We'd have to change the Expr interface, and consequently change every existing expression type to support the new method(s). If we don't control the original code or it's hard to change it for other reasons, we're in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, we'd have to violate the venerable open-closed principle, one of the main principles of object-oriented design, defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem we're hitting here is called the expression problem, and the example above shows how it applies to object-oriented programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the expression problem bites functional programming languages as well. Let's see how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The expression problem in functional programming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update 2018-02-05: a new post discusses the problem and its solutions in Haskell in more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Object-oriented approaches tend to collect functionality in objects (types). Functional languages cut the cake from a different angle, usually preferring types as thin data containers, collecting most functionality in functions (operations) that act upon them. Functional languages don't escape the expression problem - it just manifests there in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this, let's see how the expression evaluator / stringifier looks in Haskell. Haskell is a good poster child for functional programming since its pattern matching on types makes such code especially succinct:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module Expressions where

data Expr = Constant Double
          | BinaryPlus Expr Expr

stringify :: Expr -&amp;gt; String
stringify (Constant c) = show c
stringify (BinaryPlus lhs rhs) = stringify lhs
                                ++ " + "
                                ++ stringify rhs

evaluate :: Expr -&amp;gt; Double
evaluate (Constant c) = c
evaluate (BinaryPlus lhs rhs) = evaluate lhs + evaluate rhs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let's say we want to add a new operation - type checking. We simply have to add a new function typecheck and define how it behaves for all known kinds of expressions. No need to modify existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we want to add a new type (like "function call"), we get into trouble. We now have to modify all existing functions to handle this new type. So we hit exactly the same problem, albeit from a different angle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The expression problem matrix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A visual representation of the expression problem can be helpful to appreciate how it applies to OOP and FP in different ways, and how a potential solution would look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following 2-D table (a "matrix") has types in its rows and operations in its columns. A matrix cell row, col is checked when the operation col is implemented for type row:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In object-oriented languages, it's easy to add new types but difficult to add new operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whereas in functional languages, it's easy to add new operations but difficult to add new types:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A historical perspective&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The expression problem isn't new, and has likely been with us since the early days; it pops its head as soon as programs reach some not-too-high level of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fairly certain that the name expression problem comes from an email sent by Philip Wadler to a mailing list deailing with adding generics to Java (this was back in the 1990s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that email, Wadler points to the paper "Synthesizing Object-Oriented and Functional Design to Promote Re-Use" by Krishnamurthi, Felleisen and Friedman as an earlier work describing the problem and proposed solutions. This is a great paper and I highly recommend reading it. Krishnamurthi et.al., in their references, point to papers from as early as 1975 describing variations of the problem in Algol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flipping the matrix with the visitor pattern&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far the article has focused on the expression problem, and I hope it's clear by now. However, the title also has the word solution in it, so let's turn to that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's possible to kinda solve (read on to understand why I say "kinda") the expression problem in object-oriented languages; first, we have to look at how we can flip the problem on its side using the visitor pattern. The visitor pattern is very common for this kind of problems, and for a good reason. It lets us reformulate our code in a way that makes it easier to change in some dimensions (though harder in others).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the C++ sample shown above, rewriting it using the visitor pattern means adding a new "visitor" interface:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class ExprVisitor {
public:
  virtual void VisitConstant(const Constant&amp;amp; c) = 0;
  virtual void VisitBinaryPlus(const BinaryPlus&amp;amp; bp) = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And changing the Expr interface to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Expr {
public:
  virtual void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now expression types defer the actual computation to the visitor, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Constant : public Expr {
public:
  Constant(double value) : value_(value) {}

  void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
    visitor-&amp;gt;VisitConstant(*this);
  }

  double GetValue() const {
    return value_;
  }

private:
  double value_;
};

// ... similarly, BinaryPlus would have
//
//    void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
//      visitor-&amp;gt;VisitBinaryPlus(*this);
//    }
//
// ... etc.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A sample visitor for evaluation would be [2]:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Evaluator : public ExprVisitor {
public:
  double GetValueForExpr(const Expr&amp;amp; e) {
    return value_map_[&amp;amp;e];
  }

  void VisitConstant(const Constant&amp;amp; c) {
    value_map_[&amp;amp;c] = c.GetValue();
  }

  void VisitBinaryPlus(const BinaryPlus&amp;amp; bp) {
    bp.GetLhs().Accept(this);
    bp.GetRhs().Accept(this);
    value_map_[&amp;amp;bp] = value_map_[&amp;amp;(bp.GetLhs())] + value_map_[&amp;amp;(bp.GetRhs())];
  }

private:
  std::map&amp;lt;const Expr*, double&amp;gt; value_map_;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be obvious that for a given set of data types, adding new visitors is easy and doesn't require modifying any other code. On the other hand, adding new types is problematic since it means we have to update the ExprVisitor interface with a new abstract method, and consequently update all the visitors to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it seems that we've just turned the expression problem on its side: we're using an OOP language, but now it's hard to add types and easy to add ops, just like in the functional approach. I find it extremely interesting that we can do this. In my eyes this highlights the power of different abstractions and paradigms, and how they enable us to rethink a problem in a completely different light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we haven't solved anything yet; we've just changed the nature of the problem we're facing. Worry not - this is just a stepping stone to an actual solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extending the visitor pattern&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following is code excerpts from a C++ solution that follows the extended visitor pattern proposed by Krishnamurthi et. al. in their paper; I strongly suggest reading the paper (particularly section 3) if you want to understand this code on a deep level. A complete code sample in C++ that compiles and runs is available here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding new visitors (ops) with the visitor pattern is easy. Our challenge is to add a new type without upheaving too much existing code. Let's see how it's done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One small design change that we should make to the original visitor pattern is use virtual inheritance for Evaluator, for reasons that will soon become obvious:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Evaluator : virtual public ExprVisitor {
  // .. the rest is the same
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we're going to add a new type - FunctionCall:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// This is the new ("extended") expression we're adding.
class FunctionCall : public Expr {
public:
  FunctionCall(const std::string&amp;amp; name, const Expr&amp;amp; argument)
      : name_(name), argument_(argument) {}

  void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
    ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall* v =
        dynamic_cast&amp;lt;ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall*&amp;gt;(visitor);
    if (v == nullptr) {
      std::cerr &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Fatal: visitor is not ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall\n";
      exit(1);
    }
    v-&amp;gt;VisitFunctionCall(*this);
  }

private:
  std::string name_;
  const Expr&amp;amp; argument_;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we don't want to modify the existing visitors, we create a new one, extending Evaluator for function calls. But first, we need to extend the ExprVisitor interface to support the new type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall : virtual public ExprVisitor {
public:
  virtual void VisitFunctionCall(const FunctionCall&amp;amp; fc) = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we write the new evaluator, which extends Evaluator and supports the new type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class EvaluatorWithFunctionCall : public ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall,
                                  public Evaluator {
public:
  void VisitFunctionCall(const FunctionCall&amp;amp; fc) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Visiting FunctionCall!!\n";
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple inheritance, virtual inheritance, dynamic type checking... that's pretty hard-core C++ we have to use here, but there's no choice. Unfortunately, multiple inheritance is the only way C++ lets us express the idea that a class implements some interface while at the same time deriving functionality from another class. What we want to have here is an evaluator (EvaluatorWithFunctionCall) that inherits all functionality from Evaluator, and also implements the ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall interface. In Java, we could say something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class EvaluatorWithFunctionCall extends Evaluator implements ExprVisitor {
  // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in C++ virtual multiple inheritance is the tool we have. The virtual part of the inheritance is essential here for the compiler to figure out that the ExprVisitor base underlying both Evaluator and ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall is the same and should only appear once in EvaluatorWithFunctionCall. Without virtual, the compiler would complain that EvaluatorWithFunctionCall doesn't implement the ExprVisitor interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a solution, alright. We kinda added a new type FunctionCall and can now visit it without changing existing code (assuming the virtual inheritance was built into the design from the start to anticipate this approach). Here I am using this "kinda" word again... it's time to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach has multiple flaws, in my opinion:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Note the dynamic_cast in FunctionCall::Accept. It's fairly ugly that we're forced to mix in dynamic checks into this code, which should supposedly rely on static typing and the compiler. But it's just a sign of a larger problem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If we have an instance of an Evaluator, it will no longer work on the whole extended expression tree since it has no understanding of FunctionCall. It's easy to say that all new evaluators should rather be EvaluatorWithFunctionCall, but we don't always control this. What about code that was already written? What about Evaluators created in third-party or library code which we have no control of?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The virtual inheritance is not the only provision we have to build into the design to support this pattern. Some visitors would need to create new, recursive visitors to process complex expressions. But we can't anticipate in advance which dynamic type of visitor needs to be created. Therefore, the visitor interface should also accept a "visitor factory" which extended visitors will supply. I know this sounds complicated, and I don't want to spend more time on this here - but the Krishnamurthi paper addresses this issue extensively in section 3.4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, the solution is unwieldy for realistic applications. Adding one new type looks manageable; what about adding 15 new types, gradually over time? Imagine the horrible zoo of ExprVisitor extensions and dynamic checks this would lead to.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, programming is hard. I could go on and on about the limitations of classical OOP and how they surface in this example [3]. Instead, I'll just present how the expression problem can be solved in a language that supports multiple dispatch and separates the defintion of methods from the bodies of types they act upon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Solving the expression problem in Clojure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways the expression problem as displayed in this article can be solved in Clojure using the language's built-in features. Let's start with the simplest one - multi-methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First we'll define the types as records:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defrecord Constant [value])
(defrecord BinaryPlus [lhs rhs])
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we'll define evaluate as a multimethod that dispatches upon the type of its argument, and add method implementations for Constant and BinaryPlus:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defmulti evaluate class)

(defmethod evaluate Constant
  [c] (:value c))

(defmethod evaluate BinaryPlus
  [bp] (+ (evaluate (:lhs bp)) (evaluate (:rhs bp))))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can already evaluate expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;user=&amp;gt; (use 'expression.multimethod)
nil
user=&amp;gt; (evaluate (-&amp;gt;BinaryPlus (-&amp;gt;Constant 1.1) (-&amp;gt;Constant 2.2)))
3.3000000000000003
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding a new operation is easy. Let's add stringify:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defmulti stringify class)

(defmethod stringify Constant
  [c] (str (:value c)))

(defmethod stringify BinaryPlus
  [bp]
  (clojure.string/join " + " [(stringify (:lhs bp))
                              (stringify (:rhs bp))]))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;user=&amp;gt; (stringify (-&amp;gt;BinaryPlus (-&amp;gt;Constant 1.1) (-&amp;gt;Constant 2.2)))
"1.1 + 2.2"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How about adding new types? Suppose we want to add FunctionCall. First, we'll define the new type. For simplicity, the func field of FunctionCall is just a Clojure function. In real code it could be some sort of function object in the language we're interpreting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defrecord FunctionCall [func argument])
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And define how evaluate and stringify work for FunctionCall:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defmethod evaluate FunctionCall
  [fc] ((:func fc) (evaluate (:argument fc))))

(defmethod stringify FunctionCall
  [fc] (str (clojure.repl/demunge (str (:func fc)))
            "("
            (stringify (:argument fc))
            ")"))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's take it for a spin (the full code is here):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;user=&amp;gt; (def callexpr (-&amp;gt;FunctionCall twice (-&amp;gt;BinaryPlus (-&amp;gt;Constant 1.1)
                                                         (-&amp;gt;Constant 2.2))))
#'user/callexpr
user=&amp;gt; (evaluate callexpr)
6.6000000000000005
user=&amp;gt; (stringify callexpr)
"expression.multimethod/twice@52e29c38(1.1 + 2.2)"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be evident that the expression problem matrix for Clojure is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can add new ops without touching any existing code. We can also add new types without touching any existing code. The code we're adding is only the new code to handle the ops/types in question. The existing ops and types could come from a third-party library to which we don't have source access. We could still extend them for our new ops and types, without ever having to touch (or even see) the original source code [4].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is multiple dispatch necessary to cleanly solve the expression problem?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've written about multiple dispatch in Clojure before, and in the previous section we see another example of how to use the language's defmulti/defmethod constructs. But is it multiple dispatch at all? No! It's just single dispatch, really. Our ops (evaluate and stringify) dispatch on a single argument - the expression type) [5].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we're not really using multiple dispatch, what is the secret sauce that lets us solve the expression problem so elegantly in Clojure? The answer is - open methods. Note a crucial difference between how methods are defined in C++/Java and in Clojure. In C++/Java, methods have to be part of a class and defined (or at least declared) in its body. You cannot add a method to a class without changing the class's source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Clojure, you can. In fact, since data types and multimethods are orthogonal entities, this is by design. Methods simply live outside types - they are first class citizens, rather than properties of types. We don't add methods to a type, we add new methods that act upon the type. This doesn't require modifying the type's code in any way (or even having access to its code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the other popular programming languages take a middle way. In languages like Python, Ruby and JavaScript methods belong to types, but we can dynamically add, remove and replace methods in a class even after it was created. This technique is lovingly called monkey patching. While initially enticing, it can lead to big maintainability headaches in code unless we're very careful. Therefore, if I had to face the expression problem in Python I'd prefer to roll out some sort of multiple dispatch mechanism for my program rather than rely on monkey patching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Another Clojure solution - using protocols&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clojure's multimethods are very general and powerful. So general, in fact, that their performance may not be optimal for the most common case - which is single dispatch based on the type of the sole method argument; note that this is exactly the kind of dispatch I'm using in this article. Therefore, starting with Clojure 1.2, user code gained the ability to define and use protocols - a language feature that was previously restricted only to built-in types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protocols leverage the host platform's (which in Clojure's case is mostly Java) ability to provide quick virtual dispatch, so using them is a very efficient way to implement runtime polymorphism. In addition, protocols retain enough of the flexibility of multimethods to elegantly solve the expression problem. Curiously, this was on the mind of Clojure's designers right from the start. The Clojure documentation page about protocols lists this as one of their capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;[...] Avoid the 'expression problem' by allowing independent extension of the set of types, protocols, and implementations of protocols on types, by different parties. [...] do so without wrappers/adapters&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clojure protocols are an interesting topic, and while I'd like to spend some more time on them, this article is becoming too long as it is. So I'll leave a more thorough treatment for some later time and for now will just show how protocols can also be used to solve the expression problem we're discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The type definitions remain the same:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defrecord Constant [value])
(defrecord BinaryPlus [lhs rhs])
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, instead of defining a multimethod for each operation, we now define a protocol. A protocol can be thought of as an interface in a language like Java, C++ or Go - a type implements an interface when it defines the set of methods declared by the interface. In this respect, Clojure's protocols are more like Go's interfaces than Java's, as we don't have to say a-priori which interfaces a type implements when we define it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start with the Evaluatable protocol, that consists of a single method - evaluate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defprotocol Evaluatable
  (evaluate [this]))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another protocol we'll define is Stringable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defprotocol Stringable
  (stringify [this]))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can make sure our types implement these protocols:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(extend-type Constant
  Evaluatable
    (evaluate [this] (:value this))
  Stringable
    (stringify [this] (str (:value this))))

(extend-type BinaryPlus
  Evaluatable
    (evaluate [this] (+ (evaluate (:lhs this)) (evaluate (:rhs this))))
  Stringable
    (stringify [this]
      (clojure.string/join " + " [(stringify (:lhs this))
                                  (stringify (:rhs this))])))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extend-type macro is a convenience wrapper around the more general extend - it lets us implement multiple protocols for a given type. A sibling macro named extend-protocol lets us implement the same protocol for multiple types in the same invocation [6].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fairly obvious that adding new data types is easy - just as we did above, we simply use extend-type for each new data type to implement our current protocols. But how do we add a new protocol and make sure all existing data types implement it? Once again, it's easy because we don't have to modify any existing code. Here's a new protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defprotocol Serializable
  (serialize [this]))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is its implementation for the currently supported data types:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(extend-protocol Serializable
  Constant
    (serialize [this] [(type this) (:value this)])
  BinaryPlus
    (serialize [this] [(type this)
                       (serialize (:lhs this))
                       (serialize (:rhs this))]))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, extending a single protocol for multiple data types - extend-protocol is the more convenient macro to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Small interfaces are extensibility-friendly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have noted that the protocols (interfaces) defined in the Clojure solution are very small - consisting of a single method. Since adding methods to an existing protocol is much more problematic (I'm not aware of a way to do this in Clojure), keeping protocols small is a good idea. This guideline comes up in other contexts as well; for example, it's good practice to keep interfaces in Go very minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our C++ solution, splitting the Expr interface could also be a good idea, but it wouldn't help us with the expression problem, since we can't modify which interfaces a class implements after we've defined it; in Clojure we can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[1]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"Types of data" and "operations" are two terms that should be fairly obvious to modern-day programmers. Philip Wadler, in his discussion of the expression problem (see the "historical perspective" section of the article) calls them "datatypes" and "functions". A famous quote from Fred Brooks's The Mythical Man Month (1975) is "Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I wonât usually need your flowcharts; theyâll be obvious."&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[2]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Note the peculiar way in which data is passed between Visit* methods in a Expr* -&amp;gt; Value map kept in the visitor. This is due to our inability to make Visit* methods return different types in different visitors. For example, in Evaluator we'd want them to return double, but in Stringifier they'd probably return std::string. Unfortunately C++ won't let us easily mix templates and virtual functions, so we have to resort to either returning void* the C way or the method I'm using here.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Curiously, in their paper Krishnamurthi et.al. run into the same issue in the dialect of Java they're using, and propose some language extensions to solve it. Philip Wadler uses proposed Java generics in his approach.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[3]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;I can't resist, so just in brief: IMHO inheritance is only good for a very narrow spectrum of uses, but languages like C++ hail it as the main extension mechanism of types. But inheritance is deeply flawed for many other use cases, such as implementations of interfaces. Java is a bit better in this regard, but in the end the primacy of classes and their "closed-ness" make a lot of tasks - like the expression problem - very difficult to express in a clean way.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[4]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;In fact, there are plenty of examples in which the Clojure implementation and the standard library provide protocols that can be extended by the user for user-defined types. Extending user-written protocols and multimethods for built-in types is trivial. As an exercise, add an evaluate implementation for java.lang.Long, so that built-in integers could participate in our expression trees without requiring wrapping in a Constant.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[5]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;FWIW, we can formulate a multiple dispatch solution to the expression problem in Clojure. The key idea is to dispatch on two things: type and operation. Just for fun, I coded a prototype that does this which you can see here. I think the approach presented in the article - each operation being its own multimethod - is preferable, though.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[6]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The sharp-eyed reader will notice a cool connection to the expression problem matrix. extend-type can add a whole new row to the matrix, while extend-protocol adds a column. extend adds just a single cell.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;$11,000.69&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sent $11k worth of emails during DoS attack, then lost my database...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;$104,500.123&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I received an email from Netlify last weekend saying that I have a $104,500.00 bill overdue...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;$23,000.420&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is happening?! Someone spammed EchoFox and spiked my Vercel bill to $23k and caused 56k+ accounts and trials...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;$3,000.69&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attention Vercel users. Be careful what you test or deploy to Vercel. I decided to try out...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;$620.123&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My sitemap.txt used hundreds of GB/hours apparently...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;$72,000.999&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We Burnt $72K testing Firebase + Cloud Run and almost went Bankrupt...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ck (seek) finds code by meaning, not just keywords. It's a drop-in replacement for &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; that understands what you're looking for — search for "error handling" and find try/catch blocks, error returns, and exception handling code even when those exact words aren't present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cargo install ck-search&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Find error handling patterns (finds try/catch, Result types, etc.)
ck --sem "error handling" src/

# Traditional grep-compatible search still works  
ck -n "TODO" *.rs

# Combine both: semantic relevance + keyword filtering
ck --hybrid "connection timeout" src/&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Developers: Stop hunting through thousands of regex false positives. Find the code you actually need by describing what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For AI Agents: Get structured, semantic search results in JSON format. Perfect for code analysis, documentation generation, and automated refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Teams: Works exactly like &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; with the same flags and behavior, but adds semantic intelligence when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Build from source
cargo build --release

# Index your project for semantic search
./target/debug/ck index src/

# Search by meaning
./target/debug/ck --sem "authentication logic" src/
./target/debug/ck --sem "database connection pooling" src/
./target/debug/ck --sem "retry mechanisms" src/

# Use all the grep features you know
./target/debug/ck -n -C 3 "error" src/
./target/debug/ck -r "TODO|FIXME" .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find code by concept, not keywords. Searches understand synonyms, related terms, and conceptual similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# These find related code even without exact keywords:
ck --sem "retry logic"           # finds backoff, circuit breakers
ck --sem "user authentication"   # finds login, auth, credentials  
ck --sem "data validation"       # finds sanitization, type checking

# Get complete functions/classes containing matches (NEW!)
ck --sem --full-section "error handling"  # returns entire functions
ck --full-section "async def" src/        # works with regex too&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All your muscle memory works. Same flags, same behavior, same output format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ck -i "warning" *.log              # Case-insensitive  
ck -n -A 3 -B 1 "error" src/       # Line numbers + context
ck --no-filename "TODO" src/        # Suppress filenames (grep -h equivalent)
ck -l "error" src/                  # List files with matches only (NEW!)
ck -L "TODO" src/                   # List files without matches (NEW!)
ck -r --exclude "*.test.js" "bug"  # Recursive with exclusions
ck "pattern" file1.txt file2.txt   # Multiple files&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combine keyword precision with semantic understanding using Reciprocal Rank Fusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ck --hybrid "async timeout" src/    # Best of both worlds
ck --hybrid --scores "cache" src/   # Show relevance scores with color highlighting
ck --hybrid --threshold 0.02 query  # Filter by minimum relevance
ck -l --hybrid "database" src/      # List files using hybrid search&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perfect JSON output for LLMs, scripts, and automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ck --json --sem "error handling" src/ | jq '.file'
ck --json --topk 5 "TODO" . | jq -r '.preview'
ck --json --full-section --sem "database" . | jq -r '.preview'  # Complete functions&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automatically excludes cache directories, build artifacts, and system files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# These are excluded by default:
# .git, node_modules, target/, .fastembed_cache, __pycache__

# Override defaults:
ck --no-default-excludes "pattern" .     # Search everything
ck --exclude "dist" --exclude "logs" .   # Add custom exclusions&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Create semantic index (one-time setup)
ck index /path/to/project

# Now search instantly by meaning
ck --sem "database queries" .
ck --sem "error handling" .
ck --sem "authentication" .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--regex&lt;/code&gt;(default): Classic grep behavior, no indexing required&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--sem&lt;/code&gt;: Pure semantic search using embeddings (requires index)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--hybrid&lt;/code&gt;: Combines regex + semantic with intelligent ranking&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Q: How is this different from grep/ripgrep/silver-searcher?&lt;lb/&gt; A: ck includes all the features of traditional search tools, but adds semantic understanding. Search for "error handling" and find relevant code even when those exact words aren't used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Does it work offline?&lt;lb/&gt; A: Yes, completely offline. The embedding model runs locally with no network calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: How big are the indexes?&lt;lb/&gt; A: Typically 1-3x the size of your source code, depending on content. The &lt;code&gt;.ck/&lt;/code&gt; directory can be safely deleted to reclaim space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Is it fast enough for large codebases?&lt;lb/&gt; A: Yes. Indexing is a one-time cost, and searches are sub-second even on large projects. Regex searches require no indexing and are as fast as grep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Can I use it in scripts/automation?&lt;lb/&gt; A: Absolutely. The &lt;code&gt;--json&lt;/code&gt; flag provides structured output perfect for automated processing. Use &lt;code&gt;--full-section&lt;/code&gt; to get complete functions for AI analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: What about privacy/security?&lt;lb/&gt; A: Everything runs locally. No code or queries are sent to external services. The embedding model is downloaded once and cached locally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Algebraic Effects in Practice with Flix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Algebraic effects are not just a research concept anymore. You can use them in real software, today. Here’s why you’d want to do that, in order of importance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Effects make your code testable&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One of the central goals of enterprise software development. Dependency injection, mocking, architecture patterns like clean, hexagonal, DDD are all meant to tackle this. Effects solve this elegantly by separating the “what” from the “how”.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Effects give immediate visibility into what your own and 3rd-party code is doing&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Supply chain attacks are real. And they will get worse with more AI slop entering our codebases. Tools like Go’s Capslock fix this by following the whole chain of calls to stdlib functions. Effects provide this by design, as all effects are tracked by the type and effect system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Effects enable user-defined control flow abstractions&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Solving the “what color is your function” problem1. You can also leverage effects to implement Async/await, coroutines, backtracking search and other control flow patterns as user libraries without hard-coding these features into the language.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Algebraic effects come from the pure functional world, serving a purpose similar to monads — keeping track of and having control over side effects. Like monads, they enable us to write our core logic with pure functions and push side effects like IO outwards, closer to application boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike monads, effects are easy to grasp for a regular developer and give immediate benefits when starting out. For me personally they’re a more natural abstraction for managing side effects — after all, effects are in the name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting out as an academic concept, algebraic effects were introduced to the world by research languages like Eff, Koka, Effekt, Frank, Links, and more recently Ante.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have also applied effects in practice, so far usually via a monad-based approach, by making libraries in established languages like Scala Kyo / Cats Effect / ZIO; Typescript Effect and Effector, C# language-ext, C libhandler and libmprompt, C++ cpp-effects, various Haskell libraries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to forcing you into a monadic way of thinking, libraries implementing effects are limited by their host languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, I will walk you through applying algebraic effects on a real world example using Flix, a new programming language that is built with effects from the ground up, and supports functional, logic and imperative paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently only few languages support effects out of the box. The only one that I know of besides Flix is Unison. OCaml has a language extension, but there is no support yet in the type system. Haskell has added support for delimited continuations, but effects are still only available via libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to having a “type and effect system” that improves function signatures and makes sure all effects are handled, Flix supports traits, local mutability via regions, working with immutable or mutable data, and Go/Rust-like structured concurrency. It also has a first-class Datalog integration. But I will only focus on effects here. Let’s start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Type and Effect System: A Motivating Example 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a function called &lt;code&gt;calculateSalary&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def calculateSalary(base_salary, bonus_percent):
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the function name and the signature, one can assume it’s just a pure function that does some calculations. In a statically typed language you are also guaranteed that the function arguments and outputs will be of a certain type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if the types are correct, nothing stops our little &lt;code&gt;calculateSalary()&lt;/code&gt; from, say, sending an offensive email to your grandma2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def calculateSalary(base_salary, bonus_percent):
    server.sendmail("grandma@family.com", "Your cookies are terrible!")
    return base_salary * (1 + bonus_percent/100)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, you extend your type system with effects, you will see immediately in the signature that this function may do something fishy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def calculateSalary(salary: Float64, percent: Float64): 
    Float64 \ {Email} = {
//            ^^^^^^^ Notice the Email effect!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, in real life the issue it’s not usually about the grandma. Instead, this function could throw an exception — still quite dangerous. If you forget to handle the exception, your app will crash. Or another very realistic scenario is that &lt;code&gt;calculateSalary()&lt;/code&gt; calls a database to get some employee details for calculations, and you forgot to provide a database connection string. That can also result in an exception or a panic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Effect Handlers: Building Intuition 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The job of the type and effect system is not just to improve our function signatures. It’s also making sure all the effects are handled somewhere. This is where effect handlers come in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually when people talk about algebraic effects what they’re actually talking about is effect handlers. If you know exceptions, effect handlers are super easy to understand. Here’s a Jenga analogy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine the call stack is a Jenga tower. New blocks are carefully added each time you call a function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When an exception is thrown, your whole nice Jenga tower gets destroyed, all the way up to the catch() block. The catch block can safely handle the error, but the stack is unwinded, meaning you lose all of the state you had in your program before throwing the exception. You have to build your tower again, from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using effect handlers you can actually go back to your original computation after the handler is done handling the effect. The handler can also return some values back to your program, and it can even resume multiple times with different return values. You also still have the option of not resuming at all and aborting the program — that would be the effect equivalent of exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back to the Jenga analogy: if your tower is about to fall down, with effects you can freeze it mid-collapse. You then call someone for help (handler), and they decide whether to let the tower fall, magically restore it to the previous statlte. Or even hand you different blocks to try the same move (call the continuation) again, possibly multiple times with different inputs. Your Jenga tower ends up looking more like a fork or a tree, with multiple different copies of your blocks branching out at some point from the base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this more concrete, let’s start by reproducing exceptions with effects. Here’s how a try/catch looks like in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def divide(x, y):
    try:
        return x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Division by zero!")
        return None
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the equivalent code in Flix. We first define an Exception effect and a &lt;code&gt;divide()&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff Exception {
    def throw(msg: String): Void
}

def divide(x: Int32, y: Int32): Int32 \ Exception = 
    if (y == 0) {
        Exception.throw("Division by zero!")
    } else {
        x / y
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then provide a handler for this effect somewhere, preferably close to &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        println(divide(10, 0))
    } with handler Exception {
        def throw(msg, _resume) = println("Error: ${msg}")
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this does is registers an effect called Exception with a method &lt;code&gt;throw()&lt;/code&gt;. We then perform this effect in our function when there’s an error, similar to throwing an exception in the Python version. Control is transferred to the effect handler, which then decides how to handle the exception, similar to a &lt;code&gt;catch()&lt;/code&gt; block in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice we never call &lt;code&gt;resume()&lt;/code&gt; from the handler. This results in the program being aborted, just like with exceptions. Graphically, this can be represented as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;block-beta columns 2 A["Statement 1"] space:1 B["Statement 2"] space:1 C["Statement 3"] space:1 D["Perform Effect"] space:1 space:1 E["Handle Effect"] space:1 F["Process &amp;amp; Exit"] space:1 space:1 D --&amp;gt; E style D fill:#ffcccc,color:#000 style E fill:#ccffcc,color:#000 style F fill:#ccffcc,color:#000&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far so good, but this is not much different from Python. To really take full advantage of effect handlers, we can use &lt;code&gt;resume()&lt;/code&gt; to return to the original computation and proceed from the line after the effect was performed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff ResumableException {
    def askForInput(): Int32
}

def divide(x: Int32, y: Int32): Int32 \ ResumableException = 
    if (y == 0) {
        let newY = ResumableException.askForInput();
        x / newY
    } else {
        x / y
    }

def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        println(divide(10, 0))
    } with handler ResumableException {
        def askForInput(_, resume) = {
            println("Enter a new divisor:");
            resume(5) // Or get from user input
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;block-beta columns 2 A["Statement 1"] space:1 B["Statement 2"] space:1 C["Statement 3"] space:1 D["Perform Effect"] space:1 space:1 E["Handle Effect"] space:1 F["Resume"] space:1 space:1 G["Statement 4"] space:1 H["Statement 5"] space:1 I["Complete"] space:1 D --&amp;gt; E F --&amp;gt; G style D fill:#ffcccc,color:#000 style E fill:#ccffcc,color:#000 style F fill:#ffffcc,color:#000&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I called the effect &lt;code&gt;ResumableException&lt;/code&gt; here, but it’s not really an exception anymore, because the program continues normally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point we can use this power bestowed on us by effects and handlers to roll our own Async/await:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff Async {
    def await(url: String): String
}

def fetchData(): String \ Async = 
    Async.await("https://api.example.com/data")

def processData(): String \ Async = {
    let data = fetchData();
    "processed: ${data}"
}

def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        let result = processData();
        println(result)
    } with handler Async {
        def await(url, resume) = {
            // Simulate async HTTP request
            let result = "data from ${url}";
            resume(result)
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See how easy that was? This approach also avoids function coloring, since we didn’t need to use special keywords anywhere. Here’s a graphic version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;block-beta columns 2 A["Statement 1"] space:1 B["Statement 2"] space:1 C["await operation"] space:1 space:1 H1["Start async work"] space:1 H2["⏳ Long pause..."] space:1 H3["⏳ Still waiting..."] space:1 H4["✅ Async complete"] space:1 F["Resume with result"] space:1 space:1 D["Statement 3"] space:1 E["Complete"] space:1 C --&amp;gt; H1 F --&amp;gt; D style C fill:#ffcccc,color:#000 style H1 fill:#ccffcc,color:#000 style H2 fill:#fff3cd,color:#000 style H3 fill:#fff3cd,color:#000 style H4 fill:#d1ecf1,color:#000 style F fill:#ffffcc,color:#000 style D fill:#e7f3ff,color:#000 style E fill:#d4edda,color:#000&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s cool, but we can do more. Effect handlers allow you to resume multiple times:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff Choose {
    def choose(): Int32
}

def explore(): String \ Choose = {
    let x = Choose.choose();
    let y = Choose.choose();
    "${x}, ${y}"
}

def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        println(explore())
    } with handler Choose {
        def choose(_, resume) = {
            resume(1);
            resume(2);
            resume(3)
        }
&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hopefully this gives you a taste of how effect handlers work. This is just a sketch though — you can read more on this and see examples in the Flix docs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's your primary programming language?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defining our own control flow abstractions is great, but most of the time regular async/await and/or coroutines are enough for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is extremely useful for daily programming is that effects let you separate the declaration of the effect (the operation, or the effect “constructor”) from it’s implementation, defined by the effect handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add some effect definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff Database {
    def getUser(id: Int32): Option[User],
    def saveUser(user: User): Unit
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then use these definitions to perform effects in your code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def updateUserEmail(userId: Int32, newEmail: String): Result[String, User] \ {Database} = {
    match Database.getUser(userId) {
        case Some(user) =&amp;gt; {
            let updatedUser = {user | email = newEmail};
            Database.saveUser(updatedUser);
            Ok(updatedUser)
        }
        case None =&amp;gt; {
            Err("User not found")
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This replaces the need for dependency injection, since you can provide different handlers for these database operations in production vs testing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def main(): Unit \\ IO = { // production handler, uses a real database
    run {
        updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com")
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(id, resume) = {
		        // real db query
            resume(user)
        }
        def saveUser(user, resume) = {
		        // real db query
            resume()
        }
    }
}

def testUpdateUserEmail(): Unit = { // test handler, just stubs
    let testUser = {id = 123, email = "old@example.com"};
    run {
        let result = updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com");
        assert(result == Ok({testUser | email = "new@example.com"}))
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(id, resume) = resume(Some(testUser))
        def saveUser(user, resume) = {
            assert(user.email == "new@example.com");
            resume()
        }
    
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the biggest advantage that effect handlers give is that they abstract away the patterns associated with DDD, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal architecture, etc. commonly found in enterprise code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All these architectures give you some sort of way to isolate your core logic, which should be pure, from infrastructure and app logic, with deals with external dependencies. But you have to commit to an architecture and the whole team has to be disciplined enough to stick to for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using effects encourages separating the definition of effect operations from implementation by default, meaning you don’t really need these architecture patterns anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great, since relying on team discipline exclusively rarely works. It also saves a bunch of time otherwise spent on bike shedding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effect handlers also allow you to easily install stubs, which you can use to create quick test cases without boilerplate, just by swapping handlers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def testErrorConditions(): Unit = {
    run {
        let result = updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com");
        assert(result == Err("User not found"))
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(_, resume) = resume(None) // Stub: always return None
        def saveUser(_, resume) = resume()             // Won't be called
    }
}

def testSlowDatabase(): Unit = {
    run {
        let result = updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com");
        assert(result.isOk())
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(id, resume) = {
            Thread.sleep(100);  // Simulate slow query
            resume(Some({id = id, email = "old@example.com"}))
        }
        def saveUser(user, resume) = {
            Thread.sleep(50);   // Simulate slow save
            resume()
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can even make a handler that records all interactions instead of executing them. There are many possibilities here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-World App: AI movie recommendations 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To bring this all together, let’s make a real application using effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our app will fetch some movie data from TheMovieDB, and then use an LLM to recommend some movies based on user preferences provided from the console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flix interoperates with the JVM, meaning we can call code from Java, Kotlin, Scala, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s define the two custom effects we will need: MovieAPI and LLM:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff MovieAPI {
    def getPopularMovies(): String
}

eff LLM {
    def recommend(movies: String, preferences: String): String
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can then perform the effects in main like so, providing some basic handlers that use the Flix’s stdlib HTTP client:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def getRecommendation(preferences: String): String \ {MovieAPI, LLM} = {
    let movies = MovieAPI.getPopularMovies();
    LLM.recommend(movies, preferences)
}

def main(): Unit \ {Net, IO} = 
    run {
        let suggestion = getRecommendation("action movies");
        println(suggestion)
    } with handler MovieAPI {
        def getPopularMovies(_, resume) = {
            let response = HttpWithResult.get("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular", Map.empty());
            match response {
                case Result.Ok(resp) =&amp;gt; resume(Http.Response.body(resp))
                case Result.Err(_) =&amp;gt; resume("[]")
            }
        }
    } with handler LLM {
        def recommend(movies, prefs, resume) = {
            let prompt = "Movies: ${movies}. User likes: ${prefs}. Recommend one movie.";
            let response = HttpWithResult.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/completions", Map.empty(), prompt);
            match response {
                case Result.Ok(resp) =&amp;gt; resume(Http.Response.body(resp))
                case Result.Err(_) =&amp;gt; resume("Try watching a classic!")
            }
        }
    } with HttpWithResult.runWithIO
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that both effects are quite generic. So we can easily swap either the movie API or the LLM provider without touching anything in the core logic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Switch to different movie provider
with handler MovieAPI {
    def getPopularMovies(_, resume) = {
        let response = HttpWithResult.get("https://api.imdb.com/popular", Map.empty());
        // ... handle IMDB response format
    }
}

// Switch to different LLM provider  
with handler LLM {
    def recommend(movies, prefs, resume) = {
        let response = HttpWithResult.post("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", Map.empty(), prompt);
        // ... handle Claude response format
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get the user input we will need to include the standard Console effect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def main(): Unit \ {Net, IO} = 
    run {
        Console.println("What movie genres do you enjoy?");
        let preferences = Console.readln();
        let suggestion = getRecommendation(preferences);
        Console.println("Recommendation: ${suggestion}")
    } with handler MovieAPI { /* ... */ }
      with handler LLM { /* ... */ }
      with Console.runWithIO
      with HttpWithResult.runWithIO
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can also add some basic logs using the standard Logger effect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def getRecommendation(preferences: String): String \ {MovieAPI, LLM, Logger} = {
    Logger.info("Fetching popular movies...");
    let movies = MovieAPI.getPopularMovies();
    Logger.info("Getting LLM recommendation...");
    LLM.recommend(movies, preferences)
}

def main(): Unit \ {Net, IO} = 
    run {
        /* ... console interaction ... */
    } with handler MovieAPI { /* ... */ }
      with handler LLM { /* ... */ }
      with Console.runWithIO
      with Logger.runWithIO
      with HttpWithResult.runWithIO
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it! Let’s run the app and test it manually like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; flix run Main.flix
What movie genres do you enjoy?
&amp;gt; sci-fi horror
[INFO] Fetching popular movies...
[INFO] Getting LLM recommendation...
Recommendation: Based on your interest in sci-fi horror, I recommend "Alien" - a perfect blend of both genres!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can also easily write tests for the core logic by providing test handlers for our movie and LLM effects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def testRecommendation(): String = 
    run {
        getRecommendation("comedy")
    } with handler MovieAPI {
        def getPopularMovies(_, resume) = {
            resume("""[{"title": "The Grand Budapest Hotel", "genre": "comedy"}]""")
        }
    } with handler LLM {
        def recommend(movies, prefs, resume) = {
            resume("I recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel - perfect for comedy lovers!")
        }
    } with handler Logger {
        def log(_, _, resume) = resume()  // Silent in tests
    }

def runTests(): Unit \ IO = {
    let result = testRecommendation();
    println("Test result: ${result}")
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where to Go From Here 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read the Flix docs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Especially on cool features like effect polymorphism, effect exclusion etc. Check out code examples in the repo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join the community and contribute with libraries&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Flix compiler and stdlib are quite feature-rich at this point, and having JVM interop means you have all the essentials you need to write practical code. But there are still very few pure Flix libraries. So it’s very valuable to contribute some. The ideas I can think of are, for example, rebuilding standard things like Web frameworks in an effect oriented way,. Or taking advantage of the unique feature set in Flix to build something entirely new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explore effect-oriented programming&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I personally like Flix and can recommend it to others, there are other ways you can use effects for real-world software. If you’re in Typescript or Scala, try out Effect or ZIO/Kyo/Cats. If you’re looking for other languages that support effects natively, and you’re not afraid of Haskell-like syntax, check out Unison. They have a bunch of other concepts I find cool, like a better distributed computing model and the code being content-addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! I hope this article was useful. Hit me up if you have questions or feedback, and check out my website, where I’m exploring sustainable tech and coding practices: relax.software&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should I write about next?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extra: Why Algebraic Effects are Algebraic and how they relate to monads 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, practical people have left the room. Following sections are nerds-only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason, all the content I’ve been reading on algebraic effects uses this term a lot, but no one explains why specifically they’re called “algebraic”. So I did some digging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out, algebraic effects are “algebraic” because they can be described with laws and equations, like in algebra — the kind we learn at school. Which is I guess why they’re easier to grasp than monads — unlike algebra, you usually don’t study category theory in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the algebraic part only applies to the effect “constructors”, i.e the operations themselves like &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;put()&lt;/code&gt; for the state effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effect handlers, on the other hand, are not algebraic at all, which can be a bit confusing. But it makes sense if you think about it — the purpose of handlers is to act as “deconstructors”, interpreting our algebraic effect operations by means of things that cannot be described by algebraic equations alone, such as continuations .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, effect handlers are often (but not always) implemented via delimited continuations. There are also other, static/lexically scoped and maybe more performant approaches being explored, such as this one&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Real” algebraic effects don’t require monads. Monads and algebraic effects are two different concepts tackling similar problems. One is expressible in terms of the other, but algebraic effects are arguably more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could actually implement algebraic effects using a continuation monad. If we don’t care about types, effects are perfectly expressible with monads and vice versa&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problems appear when we introduce types into the picture. In a properly typed world, you can’t actually reproduce the same expressiveness you get with effects using monads. You’ll end up breaking the type system or reducing expressiveness at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effects are, in this sense, more “powerful” than monads with their natural type system: you can express infinitely many computations with them. E.g if you use a &lt;code&gt;tick()&lt;/code&gt; effect and you do a bunch of sequential &lt;code&gt;tick()&lt;/code&gt; s, the result will be a distinct computation each time. With monads and their natural type system the set of computations you could express is finite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, with monads you commit to a specific interpretation of an effect in advance, while effects completely decouple effect definition from it’s implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, effects are easier to compose than monads. With monad transformers you quickly hit the wall having to define a bunch of different combinations that each have distinct semantics. Effects compose naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So while effect libraries in languages like Typescript and Scala are able to express effects using monads3, and the behavior could be identical at runtime, this cannot replace having an actual type and effect system, with effects being properly typed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you usually learn about new things?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What color is your function” is a problem explored in this article. In languages which have Async baked in via special keywords (e.g JavaScript async/await) it becomes a pain to refactor and to combine synchronous and asynchronous code. If you make one function deep in the call stack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;, all the callers will have to be made Async as well, or&lt;code&gt;await()&lt;/code&gt;the results. With effects you don’t have this issue as there are no keywords and no special behavior. Async is simply done with effect handlers. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I like the grandma example more than the “launch missiles” popular in the Haskell world. Took it from this article by Kevin Mahoney. It’s somehow more offensive ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See some examples in this article. This also shows how Haskell’s new delimited continuation support can be used to implement algebraic effects and handlers ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45157466</guid></item><item><title>More and more people are tuning the news out: 'Now I don't have that anxiety</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/sep/01/news-avoidance-high-anxiety</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="76c151af9265a653"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News has never been more accessible – but for some, that’s exactly the problem. Flooded with information and relentless updates, more and more people around the world are tuning out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reasons vary: for some it’s the sheer volume of news, for others the emotional toll of negative headlines or a distrust of the media itself. In online forums devoted to mindfulness and mental health, people discuss how to step back, from setting limits to cutting the news out entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Now that I don’t watch the news, I just don’t have that anxiety. I don’t have dread,” said Mardette Burr, an Arizona retiree who says she stopped watching the news about eight years ago. “There were times that I’d be up at two or three o’clock in the morning upset about something that was going on in the world that I just didn’t have a lot of control over.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She’s not alone. Globally, news avoidance is at a record high, according to an annual survey by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism published in June. This year, 40% of respondents, surveyed across nearly 50 countries, said they sometimes or often avoid the news, up from 29% in 2017 and the joint highest figure recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number was even higher in the US, at 42%, and in the UK, at 46%. Across markets, the top reason people gave for actively trying to avoid the news was that it negatively impacted their mood. Respondents also said they were worn out by the amount of news, that there is too much coverage of war and conflict, and that there’s nothing they can do with the information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Julian Burrett, a British marketing professional, said he’s intentionally unplugged from the news since the pandemic, after feeling almost addicted to constant negative updates. He’s deleted most media apps from his phone and avoids TV bulletins. Last year, he even started a small Reddit community, r/newsavoidance, to “consider the pros and cons, tips and tricks, and tools of avoiding news”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Others who spoke to the Guardian described varied approaches. One said he checks in on the news once a week to stay informed without being overwhelmed. Another said he has shunned the news for years, citing its effect on his mood and a broader distrust in the press. A Maryland man described feeling “enraged” by recent political developments, and tries to set boundaries by scanning headlines only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that increased exposure to news – particularly via television and social media, and especially coverage of tragic or distressing events – can take a toll on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, Roxane Cohen Silver has examined the consequences of consuming media about crises, from 9/11 and the Covid-19 pandemic to climate-related disasters and mass shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“With greater exposure, we see greater distress in people’s reports of their mental health. Greater anxiety, greater depression, greater post traumatic stress symptoms, acute stress symptoms,” said Silver, professor of psychology, medicine and public health at the University of California, Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In recent years, her research has found political polarization to be a major stressor for people in the US. Similarly, political concerns topped the list last year in the American Psychological Association’s Stress in America poll, with the economy and spread of false news also ranking prominently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the rise of smartphones and social media, opportunities for contact with distressing content have exploded, Silver noted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s just ample opportunity to be exposed to news all the time, through either push notifications on people’s phones, or people can be consuming news across many different modes simultaneously,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Viewing graphic imagery, in particular, is associated with psychological distress – a concern in an era when disturbing images of tragedies circulate freely beyond newsrooms’ control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growing body of advice online promotes healthier ways to consume news. Much of it focuses on creating guardrails so people can be deliberate about finding information when they’re ready for it, instead of letting it reach them in a constant stream. This might include signing up for newsletters or summaries from trusted sources, turning off news alerts and limiting social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“People can stay informed without doomscrolling,” Silver said. Applying learnings from her research to her own life, she reads news online, but skips videos, television and social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t see any psychological or physical benefit from consumption of those kinds of images,” she said. “So if I’m reading a story and there is a video, I don’t click on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She suggests setting specific windows of time to read the news rather than staying immersed in that environment constantly, noting that it helps if people feel a sense of control over how much they’re being exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benjamin Toff, director of the Minnesota Journalism Center at the University of Minnesota, studied the trend in his book Avoiding the News. He draws a key distinction between those who consistently avoid the news and those who simply limit their consumption – the latter, he says, is “perfectly healthy”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We live in a world in which you can access news 24/7 and be inundated with information at all times. But that doesn’t mean you should,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What worries him and his co-authors is when withdrawal turns into a cycle that deepens social divides, leaving some groups less likely to participate in political life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The more you disengage, disconnect from the news, the harder it becomes to try to make sense of what’s happening on any given story,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authors observed that consistent news avoidance tends to be more common among young people, women, and lower socioeconomic classes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you believe as we do, that normatively, we want people to be able to have the same opportunities to engage politically, to vote, to be vocal about the political issues that matter, then we think it’s a problem that people are disengaging from news,” Toff said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Air pollution directly linked to increased dementia risk&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure accelerates the development of Lewy body dementia and Parkinson’s disease with dementia in people who are predisposed to the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An analysis of 56 million people has shown that exposure to air pollution increases the risk of developing a particular form of dementia, the third most common type after Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study, published in Science on 4 September1, suggests that there is a clear link between long-term exposure to PM2.5 — airborne particles that are smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter — and the development of dementia in people with Lewy body dementia or Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study found that PM2.5 exposure does not necessarily induce Lewy body dementia, but “accelerates the development,” in people who are already genetically predisposed to it, says Hui Chen, a clinician–neuroscientist at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PM2.5 exposure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lewy body dementia is an umbrella term for two different types of dementia: Parkinson’s disease with dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. In both cases, dementia is caused by the build-up of α-synuclein (αSyn) proteins into clumps, called Lewy bodies, in the brain’s nerve cells, which cause the cells to stop working and eventually die. Studies have suggested that long-term exposure to air pollution from car-exhaust, wildfires and factory fumes, is linked with increased risks of developing neurodegenerative illnesses, including Parkinson's disease with dementia2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Study co-author Xiaobo Mao, who researches neurodegenerative conditions at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, says he and his colleagues wanted to determine if PM2.5 exposure also influenced the risk of developing Lewy body dementia. They analysed 2000–2014 hospital-admissions data from 56.5 million people with Lewy body dementia and Parkinson’s disease with or without dementia. The data served to identify people with severe neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They found that long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for all three neurodegenerative conditions, including a 12% increased risk for severe dementia with Lewy bodies that required hospitalization. They noted that living in areas of higher PM2.5 exposure was linked with a higher relative risk of Lewy body dementia — including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia — compared with Parkinson’s without dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team then performed experiments in mice to investigate why exposure to air pollution affected dementia risk. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 pollution through their nostrils, then the researchers tested for behaviours linked with dementia-like problems. After ten months of PM2.5 exposure, mice showed behavioural challenges in maze exploration tests for spatial memory, and tasks that tested their recognition of new objects. At ten months, the team also observed a substantial increase in the build-up of αSyn in the animals’ brains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exposure to PM2.5 for ten months also caused the shrinkage of the medial temporal lobe in mice — a brain region which is responsible for memory formation and retrieval. In comparison, there were no changes to the brains of genetically modified mice lacking αSyn, suggesting the protein is required for neurodegenerative pathology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team also found clumps of αSyn in the gut and lungs of mice exposed to PM2.5, but not in the control or genetically modified mice. Mao says that αSyn acts like a seed, which can propagate and spread from the gut to the brain by way of the gut–brain axis, and eventually cause Alzheimer’s disease or Lewy body dementia. PM2.5 also accumulates in the lungs, causing inflammation before entering the bloodstream and crossing the blood–brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predisposition needed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers next investigated gene-expression changes caused by PM2.5 exposure in mice and compared them with gene-expression changes observed in people with Lewy body dementia. They focused on the anterior cingulate cortex — a brain region linked with cognitive deficits in people with dementia. They found a strong correlation of gene-expression changes between PM2.5-exposed mice and people with Lewis body dementia and Parkinson’s disease with dementia, but no correlation with Parkinson’s disease without dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Belling the Cat&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belling the Cat is a fable also known under the titles The Bell and the Cat and The Mice in Council. In the story, a group of mice agree to attach a bell to a cat's neck to warn of its approach in the future, but they fail to find a volunteer to perform the job. The term has become an idiom describing a group of persons, each agreeing to perform an impossibly difficult task under the misapprehension that someone else will be chosen to run the risks and endure the hardship of actual accomplishment.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although often attributed to Aesop, it was not recorded before the Middle Ages and has been confused with the quite different fable of Classical origin titled The Cat and the Mice. In the classificatory system established for the fables by Ben Edwin Perry, it is numbered 613, which is reserved for Mediaeval attributions outside the Aesopic canon.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Synopsis and idiomatic use&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The fable concerns a group of mice who debate plans to nullify the threat of a marauding cat. One of them proposes placing a bell around its neck, so that they are warned of its approach. The plan is applauded by the others, until one mouse asks who will volunteer to place the bell on the cat. All of them make excuses. The story is used to teach the wisdom of evaluating a plan on not only how desirable the outcome would be but also how it can be executed. It provides a moral lesson about the fundamental difference between ideas and their feasibility, and how this affects the value of a given plan.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fable gives rise to the idiom to bell the cat, which means to attempt, or agree to perform, an impossibly difficult task.[4] Historically 'Bell the Cat' is frequently claimed to have been a nickname given to fifteenth-century Scottish nobleman Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus in recognition of his part in the arrest and execution of James III's alleged favourite, Thomas (often misnamed as Robert) Cochrane. In fact the earliest evidence for this use is from Hume of Godscroft's history of the Douglases published in 1644,[5] and therefore is more reflective of perception of the idiom in the seventeenth century than the fifteenth.[6] In the 21st century the idiom was adopted by the investigative journalism group Bellingcat.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first English collection to attribute the fable to Aesop was John Ogilby's of 1687; in this there is a woodcut (by Francis Barlow), followed by a 10-line verse synopsis by Aphra Behn with the punning conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Councell's easily given, but the effect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Oft renders it uneasy to transact.[8]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Early versions and later interpretations&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest versions of the story appears as a parable critical of the clergy in Odo of Cheriton's Parabolae.[9] Written around 1200, it was afterwards translated into Welsh, French and Spanish. Sometime later, the story is found in the work now referred to as Ysopet-Avionnet, which is largely made up of Latin poems by the 12th century Walter of England, followed by a French version dating from as much as two centuries later. It also includes four poems not found in Walter's Esopus; among them is the tale of "The Council of the Mice" (De muribus consilium facientibus contra catum). The author concludes with the scornful comment that laws are of no effect without the means of adequately enforcing them and that such parliamentary assemblies as he describes are like the proverbial mountain in labour that gives birth to a mouse.[10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fable also appeared as a cautionary tale in Nicholas Bozon's Anglo-Norman Contes Moralisés (1320), referring to the difficulty of curbing the outrages of superior lords.[11] It was in this context too that the story of a parliament of rats and mice was retold in William Langland's allegorical poem Piers Plowman.[12] The episode is said to refer to the Parliament of 1376 which attempted unsuccessfully to remedy popular dissatisfaction over the exactions made by nobles acting in the royal name.[13] Langland's French contemporary, the satirical Eustache Deschamps, also includes the story among his other moral ballades based on fables as "Les souris et les chats".[14] It has been suggested that in this case too there is a political subtext. The poem was written as a response to the aborted invasion of England in 1386 and contrasts French dithering in the face of English aggression.[15] The refrain of Deschamps' ballade, Qui pendra la sonnette au chat (who will bell the cat) was to become proverbial in France if, indeed, it does not record one already existing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following century, the Italian author Laurentius Abstemius made of the fable a Latin cautionary tale titled De muribus tintinnabulum feli appendere volentibus (The mice who wanted to bell the cat)[16] in 1499. A more popular version in Latin verse was written by Gabriele Faerno and printed posthumously in his Fabulae centum ex antiquis auctoribus delectae (100 delightful fables from ancient authors, Rome 1564), a work that was to be many times reprinted and translated up to start of the 19th century. Titled simply "The Council of the Mice", it comes to rest on the drily stated moral that 'a risky plan can have no good result'. The story was evidently known in Flanders too, since 'belling the cat' was included among the forty Netherlandish Proverbs in the composite painting of Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1559). In this case a man in armour is performing the task in the lower left foreground.[17] A century later, La Fontaine's Fables made the tale even better known under the title Conseil tenu par les rats (II.2).[18]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mediaeval times the fable was applied to political situations and British commentaries on it were sharply critical of the limited democratic processes of the day and their ability to resolve social conflict when class interests were at stake. This applies equally to the plot against the king's favourite in 15th century Scotland and the direct means that Archibald Douglas chose to resolve the issue. While none of the authors who used the fable actually incited revolution, the 1376 Parliament that Langland satirised was followed by Wat Tyler's revolt five years later, while Archibald Douglas went on to lead a rebellion against King James. During the Renaissance the fangs of the fable were being drawn by European authors, who restricted their criticism to pusillanimous conduct in the face of rashly proposed solutions. A later exception was the Russian fabulist Ivan Krylov, whose adaptation of the story satirises croneyism. In his account only those with perfect tails are to be allowed into the assembly; nevertheless, a tailless rat is admitted because of a family connection with one of the lawmakers.[19]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There still remains the perception of a fundamental opposition between consensus and individualism. This is addressed in the lyrics of "Bell the Cat",[20] a performance put out on DVD by the Japanese rock band LM.C in 2007.[21] This is the monologue of a house cat that wants to walk alone since "Society is by nature evil". It therefore refuses to conform and is impatient of restriction: "your hands hold on to everything – bell the cat". While the lyric is sung in Japanese, the final phrase is in English. Another modernised adaptation based on this fable, that updates the moral, has been published by Patricia McKissack in her Who Will Bell the Cat? (illustrated by Christopher Cyr).[22][23]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a Tibetan proverb that is very similar, "Putting a bell on the cat's neck after the mother of mice was consulted"[24]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Illustrations&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Several French artists depicted the fable during the 19th century, generally choosing one of two approaches. Gustave Doré and the genre painter Aurélie Léontine Malbet (fl. 1868–1906)[25] pictured the rats realistically acting out their debate. The illustrator Grandville,[26] along with the contemporaries Philibert Léon Couturier (1823–1901)[27] and Auguste Delierre (1829–1890),[28] caricature the backward practice and pomposity of provincial legislatures, making much the same point as did the Mediaeval authors who first recorded the tale. At the end of the century a publishing curiosity reverts to the first approach. This was in the woodblock print by Kawanabe Kyōsui that appeared in the collection of La Fontaine's fables that was commissioned and printed in Tokyo in 1894 and then exported to France.[29] In the upper left-hand corner a cat is seen through a warehouse window as it approaches across the roofs while inside the rats swarm up the straw-wrapped bales of goods. At its summit the chief rat holds the bell aloft. An earlier Japanese woodblock formed part of Kawanabe Kyōsai's Isoho Monogotari series (1870–80). This shows an assembly of mice in Japanese dress with the proposer in the foreground, brandishing the belled collar.[30]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Musical settings&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;In the 18th century the fable was one among many set by Louis-Nicolas Clérambault in the fables section of Nouvelles poésies spirituelles et morales sur les plus beaux airs (1730–37).[31] In the following century the text of La Fontaine's fable was set for male voices by Louis Lacombe[32] and by the Catalan composer Isaac Albéniz for medium voice and piano in 1889.[33] In 1950 it was set for four male voices by Florent Schmitt.[34] But while La Fontaine's humorously named cat Rodilardus, and antiquated words like discomfiture (déconfiture), may fit an art song, there have also been faithful interpretations in the field of light music. A popular composer of the day, Prosper Massé, published such a setting in 1846.[35] More recently there has been Pierre Perret's interpretation as part of his 20 Fables inspirées de Jean de la Fontaine (1995),[36] and a jazz arrangement on Daniel Roca's 10 Fables de La Fontaine (2005).[37]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Collective action problem&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Who Will Bell the Cat?, a children's picture book based on the fable&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ Strouf, Judie L.

    &lt;p&gt;Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'the cloud' with 'my butt'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt'. In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very polarizing issue in the cloud-to-butt user community. Forks are free to do whatever they like. But officially, this extension replaces only the phrase described above, and therefore it did not replace your cloudflare URLs with buttflare URLs. Thank you for your concern.&lt;/p&gt;
