  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;How I spent two decades tracking down the creators of a 1987 USENET game and learned modern packaging tools in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Discovery: A Digital Time Capsule from 1987&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picture this: October 26, 1987. The Berlin Wall still stands, the World Wide Web is just text, and software is distributed through USENET newsgroups in text files split across multiple posts. On that day, Edward Barlow posted something special to &lt;code&gt;comp.sources.games&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“conquest – middle earth multi-player game, Part01/05”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s how Ed Barlow announced it at the time, before quickly changed the name to Conquer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was Conquer – a sophisticated multi-player strategy game that would influence countless others. Players controlled nations in Middle Earth, managing resources, armies, magic systems, and diplomatic relations. What made it remarkable wasn’t just the gameplay, but how it was built and distributed in an era when “open source” wasn’t even a term yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 0: University Days.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was during these days, in the middle of the 90s, that my fellow students and I spent hours experimenting with terminals in the Computer Unix Labs, USENET, links, news, msgs, and of course: conquer. That game was a gem that required to be the leader of a country, and with a map representing as characters each player could control their elven kingdom, orcish empire, or human armies to fight each other while controlling all the details of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But by 2006, this piece of computing history was trapped in legal limbo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 1: The Quest Begins (2006)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a university student in Spain in the early ’90s, I’d encountered Conquer in the Unix labs. Fast forward to 2006, and I realized this pioneering game was at risk of being lost forever. The source code existed, scattered across ancient USENET archives, but its licensing was unclear – typical of the “post it and see what happens” era of early internet software distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started what I thought would be a simple project: get permission from the original authors to relicense the code under GPL so it could be properly preserved and packaged for modern Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 2: Digital Detective Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding Edward Barlow and Adam Bryant in 2006 was like archaeological work. Email addresses from the 1980s were long dead. USENET posts provided few clues. I scoured old university directories, googled fragments of names, and followed digital breadcrumbs across decades-old forums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The breakthrough came through pure persistence and a bit of luck. After months of searching, I managed to contact Ed Barlow. His response was refreshingly casual: “Yes i delegated it all to adam aeons ago. Im easy on it all…. copyleft didnt exist when i wrote it and it was all for fun so…”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there was a catch – I needed permission from Adam Bryant too, and he seemed to have vanished into the digital ether.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 3: The Long Wait (2006-2011)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I documented everything on the Debian Legal mailing lists, created a GNU Savannah task (#5945), and even wrote blog posts hoping Adam would find them. The legal experts were clear: I needed explicit written permission from both copyright holders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Years passed. The project stalled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, on February 23, 2011, something magical happened. My phone buzzed with a contact form submission:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I heard news of the request to release the code. I grant permission to release the code under GPL.” – Adam Bryant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He had found one of my articles online and reached out on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 4: The Plot Twist – Version 5 Emerges (2025)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2025, and Stephen Smoogen contacts me about my relicesing efforts in 2006 and how he was particularly interested in reviving: Conquer Version 5 – a complete rewrite by Adam with advanced features like automatic data conversion, enhanced stability, and sophisticated administrative tools. This wasn’t just an update; it was a complete reimagining of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But V5 had a different legal history. In the ’90s, there had been commercial arrangements. Would Adam agree to GPL this version too?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His response: “I have no issues with applying a new GPL license to Version 5 as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 5: The Missing Piece – PostScript Magic&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just when I thought the story was complete, I discovered another contributor: MaF, who had created PostScript utilities for generating printable game maps – a crucial feature in the pre-GUI era when players needed physical printouts to strategize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tracking down MaF in 2025 led me to his company, where he’s now Director of Product Security. His response: “Oh, that was a long time ago. But yes, that was me. And I have no problem with relicensing it to GPL.”&lt;lb/&gt;Richard Caley: More Than Just a Legal Footnote&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But not all searches end with an answer. Some end with silence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My investigation of Richard Caley followed the same digital breadcrumbs. I traced him to the University of Edinburgh, where he worked on speech synthesis. I found his technical contributions to FreeBSD. But the trail went cold around 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I found him – not in a USENET archive, but on the front page of his own website, preserved exactly as he left it in web.archive.org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Richard Caley suffered a fatal heart attack on the 22nd of April, 2005. He was only 41, but had been an undiagnosed diabetic, probably for some considerable time. His web pages remain as he left them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading those words felt different from finding a historical record. This wasn’t archival research – this was walking into someone’s house years after they’d gone and finding a note on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The page continued:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Over and above his tremendous ability with computers and programming, Richard had a keen mind and knowledge of an extraordinary range of topics, both of which he used in frequent contributions to on-line discussions. Despite his unique approach to speling, his prolific contributions to various news group debates informed and amused many over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Caleyisms” – The Man Behind the Code&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then I discovered his “Caleyisms” – a curated collection of his most brilliant USENET responses that revealed not just a programmer, but a person:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s a shell suit?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Oil company executive.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you prepare for a pyroclastic flow hitting Edinburgh?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Hang 1000 battered Mars bars on strings and stand back?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On his book addiction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I never got the hang of libraries, they keep wanting the things back and get upset when they need a crowbar to force it out of my hands.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His humor was dry, intelligent, and uniquely British. In technical discussions, he could be brutally precise:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Lack of proper punctuation, spacing, line breaks, capitalisation etc. is like bad handwriting, it doesn’t make it impossible to read what was written, just harder. But you probably write in green crayon anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Digital Office Preserved&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exploring his preserved website felt like walking through his digital office. The directory structure revealed his passions: FreeBSD how-tos, POVRAY experiments, wallpaper images, technical projects. His self-deprecating humor shone through in his “About” section:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Thankfully I don’t have a photograph to inflict on you. Just use the picture of Iman Bowie to the left and then imagine someone who looks exactly the opposite in every possible way. This probably explains why she is married to David Bowie and I’m not.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here was a complete person – technical director at Interactive Information Ltd, speech synthesis researcher, FreeBSD enthusiast, Kate Bush fan, and a wit who brightened countless online discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legal reality was harsh: Richard’s contributions to Conquer couldn’t be relicensed. The university couldn’t help contact heirs due to privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His friends had preserved his memory with a simple ASCII tribute at the end of his page:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;^_^&lt;lb/&gt;(O O)&lt;lb/&gt;\_/@@\&lt;lb/&gt;\\~~/&lt;lb/&gt;~~&lt;lb/&gt;- RJC RIP&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Conquer project documentation, Richard Caley isn’t remembered as a “problem case” or “unlicensable code.” He’s honored as the vibrant person he was – the brilliant mind behind the “Caleyisms,” the researcher who contributed to speech synthesis, the FreeBSD advocate, and the witty participant in early online communities whose words continue to amuse and inform, decades after he wrote them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 6: Modern Renaissance – Enter GitHub, CICD and Modern Distributions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s where the story gets really interesting. While working on preserving these Unix classics, I decided to learn modern packaging techniques. I chose to implement both APK (Alpine Linux) and Debian packaging for the games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For APK packages, I used Melange – a sophisticated build system that creates provenance-tracked, reproducible packages for the Wolfi “undistro”. The irony? I discovered this tool when some friend started to work for the company that created it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 7: The Technical Journey: From USENET to Modern CI/CD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transformation has been remarkable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1987 Original:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Distributed as split USENET posts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manual compilation with system-specific Makefiles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No version control or automated testing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025 Revival:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Modern CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- name: Build APK package
  run: melange build conquer.yaml
- name: Build Debian package  
  run: dpkg-buildpackage -b
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Modern Additions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPLv3 relicensing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make building system modernization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;C Codebase partially updated to support modern ANSI C99 specification&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debian packaging&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;APK packaging with Melange&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see the complete transformation in the repositories:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conquer v4 – The original classic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conquer v5 – The advanced rewrite&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original Conquer v4 code, by Ed Barlow and Adam Bryant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Conquer running in docker container alongside Apache, Curses to WebSockets output thanks to ttyd. Now we can play through the web!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conquer Version 5 – The evolution of the classical Conquer, by Adam Bryant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 8: The Human Element: Why This Matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about preserving old games – it’s about preserving the story of computing itself. Ed Barlow and Adam Bryant were pioneers who built sophisticated multiplayer experiences when most people had never heard of the internet. They distributed software through USENET because that’s what you did – you shared cool things with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Martin Forssen’s PostScript utilities represent the ingenuity of early developers who solved problems with whatever tools were available. Want to visualize your game state? Write a PostScript generator!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 20-year relicensing effort demonstrates something crucial about open source: it’s not just about code, it’s about community and continuity. Every time someone maintains a legacy project, documents its history, or tracks down long-lost contributors, they’re weaving the threads that connect computing’s past to its future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons for Modern Developers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Document everything: Those casual USENET posts became crucial legal evidence decades later&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;License clearly: Ed’s comment that “copyleft didnt exist when i wrote it” highlights how licensing landscapes evolve&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Community matters: Adam found my articles because the community was talking about preservation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technical debt is temporal: What seems like legacy tech today might be tomorrow’s archaeological treasure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modern tools can revive ancient code: Melange and modern CI/CD gave 1987 software a 2025 renaissance&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Continuing Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Conquer games are now fully GPL v3 licensed and available with modern packaging. They represent not just playable software, but a complete case study in software archaeology, legal frameworks for preservation, and the evolution of development practices across four decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next chapter? Teaching these classic strategy games to a new generation of developers and gamers, while demonstrating that proper legal frameworks and modern tooling can give any historical software a second life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best way to learn cutting-edge technology is by applying it to preserve computing history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What historical software deserves preservation in your field? Have you ever traced the lineage of code back to its original creators?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45865159</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 12:44:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Montana becomes first state to enshrine 'right to compute' into law</title><link>https://montananewsroom.com/montana-becomes-first-state-to-enshrine-right-to-compute-into-law/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="a971129b188e4438"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montana has made history as the first state in the U.S. to legally protect its citizens’ right to access and use computational tools and artificial intelligence technologies. Governor Greg Gianforte signed Senate Bill 212, officially known as the Montana Right to Compute Act (MRTCA), into law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking legislation affirms Montanans’ fundamental right to own and operate computational resources — including hardware, software, and AI tools — under the state’s constitutional protections for property and free expression. Supporters of the bill say it represents a major step in securing digital freedoms in an increasingly AI-driven world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Montana is once again leading the way in defending individual liberty,” said Senator Daniel Zolnikov, the bill’s sponsor and a longtime advocate for digital privacy. “With the Right to Compute Act, we are ensuring that every Montanan can access and control the tools of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the law allows state regulation of computation in the interest of public health and safety, it sets a high bar: any restrictions must be demonstrably necessary and narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. Legal experts note that this is one of the most protective standards available under Montana law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The act also includes provisions for AI-controlled critical infrastructure, requiring both a “shutdown mechanism” to allow human control and annual safety reviews — a move aimed at balancing innovation with public safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bill has drawn praise from privacy advocates and tech policy groups. Tanner Avery, Policy Director at the free-market think tank Frontier Institute, called the law a “flag in the ground” for digital rights, adding: “Montana has made clear it will treat any attempt to infringe on fundamental digital freedoms with the utmost scrutiny.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MRTCA stands in stark contrast to recent regulatory efforts in other states, such as California, Virginia, and New York, where proposals to rein in AI technologies have either failed or been heavily revised. Montana’s approach leans toward empowering individual users rather than restricting access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The law has already inspired similar efforts in New Hampshire, where lawmakers are pushing a constitutional amendment guaranteeing access to computation. Rep. Keith Ammon, the state’s Majority Floor Leader, praised Montana’s leadership: “This is the kind of bold move that sets the tone for the rest of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nationally, the Right to Compute movement is gaining traction. Spearheaded by the grassroots group RightToCompute.ai, the campaign argues that computation — like speech and property — is a fundamental human right. “A computer is an extension of the human capacity to think,” the organization states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The movement is supported by Haltia.AI, a Dubai-based AI startup, and the ASIMOV Protocol, a blockchain consortium advocating for decentralized AI infrastructure. Talal Thabet, Co-Founder of both groups, praised Montana’s law as “a monumental step forward in ensuring individuals retain control of their own data and digital tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As debates over AI governance and digital rights continue to evolve, Montana’s bold new law could serve as a blueprint for other states seeking to safeguard freedom in the digital era.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Dijkstra</title><link>https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="e615734b00f3a2b8"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was one of the most influential members of computing science’s founding generation. Among the domains in which his scientific contributions are fundamental are&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;algorithm design&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;programming languages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;program design&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;operating systems&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;distributed processing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;formal specification and verification&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;design of mathematical arguments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, Dijkstra was intensely interested in teaching, and in the relationships between academic computing science and the software industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During his forty-plus years as a computing scientist, which included positions in both academia and industry, Dijkstra’s contributions brought him many prizes and awards, including computing science’s highest honor, the ACM Turing Award.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Manuscripts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like most of us, Dijkstra always believed it a scientist’s duty to maintain a lively correspondence with his scientific colleagues. To a greater extent than most of us, he put that conviction into practice. For over four decades, he mailed copies of his consecutively numbered technical notes, trip reports, insightful observations, and pungent commentaries, known collectively as “EWDs”, to several dozen recipients in academia and industry. Thanks to the ubiquity of the photocopier and the wide interest in Dijkstra’s writings, the informal circulation of many of the EWDs eventually reached into the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although most of Dijkstra’s publications began life as EWD manuscripts, the great majority of his manuscripts remain unpublished. They have been inaccessible to many potential readers, and those who have received copies have been unable to cite them in their own work. To alleviate both of these problems, the department has collected over a thousand of the manuscripts in this permanent web site, in the form of PDF bitmap documents (to read them, you’ll need a copy of Acrobat Reader). We hope you will find it convenient, useful, inspiring, and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original manuscripts, along with diaries, correspondence, photographs, and other papers, are housed at The Center for American History of The University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indexes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each manuscript file is accessible through either of two indexes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;0. BibTeX index. Each entry includes all the available bibliographic data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Ad-hoc indexes. These contain titles only, but are faster if you know what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EWD-numbered documents(This index gives an approximate correspondence between manuscripts’ EWD numbers and the year in which they appeared.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical reports from the Mathematical Centre (now CWI: Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find a table relating EWD numbers to publication years here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the privately circulated manuscripts collected here were subsequently published; their copyrights are held by their respective publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transcripts and translations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growing number of the PDF bitmap documents have been transcribed to make them searchable and accessible to visitors who are visually impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few of the manuscripts written in Dutch have been translated into English, and one —EWD1036— has been translated into Spanish. EWD28 has been translated from English into Russian.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these transcriptions and translations we are grateful to over sixty contributors. Volunteers willing to transcribe manuscripts are always welcome (Note: doing EWDs justice in translation has turned out to be too difficult, so we are no longer soliciting translations).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proofreading Each transcription gets a cursory scan as it’s prepared for uploading, but since a web page can always be updated, I don’t strive for (unattainable) perfection before installing it. On the web, proofreading is a game that can be played by every reader; if you spot an error, please&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Links between EWDs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A compilation of cross-references has been contributed by Diethard Michaelis. As its author notes, the collection is incomplete, and all readers are invited to add to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dijkstra often returned to topics about which he had already written, when he had something new to say or even just a better way of saying it. When Dijkstra himself didn’t provide the backward references, we indicate the relationship by "see also" links in the index, leaving the judgment of the extent to which the earlier EWD is superseded by the later one to the reader. Any reader who notices such a relationship is invited to&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summaries&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have begun adding summaries of the EWDs. This innovation was suggested by Günter Rote, who contributed the first dozen summaries. Additional contributions of summaries—especially summaries in English of EWDs in Dutch—are most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copyrights&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;About Dijkstra and his work&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interview with Dijkstra (Spanish translation here) was conducted in 1985 by Rogier F. van Vlissingen, who has also written a personal reflection on “Dijkstra’s sense of what computer science and programming are and what they aren’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another interview was conducted by Philip L. Frana in August 2001. A transcript is available in the on-line collection of the Charles Babbage Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To mark the occasion of Dijkstra’s retirement in November 1999 from the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences, which he had occupied since 1984, and to celebrate his forty-plus years of seminal contributions to computing science, the Department of Computer Sciences organized a symposium, In Pursuit of Simplicity, which took place on his birthday in May 2000. The symposium’s program (10 MB) contains an outline of Dijkstra’s career, as well as a collection of quotes culled from his writings, from his blackboard, and from what others have said about him. Banquet speeches by David Gries, Fred Schneider, Krzysztof Apt, W.M. Turski, and H. Richards were recorded on a video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dijkstra’s death in August 2002 was marked by many obituaries and memorials, including the Computer Sciences department’s memorial celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A remembrance of Dijkstra was posted in May 2008 by Maarten van Emden (thanks to Tristram Brelstaff for noting it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021 Krzysztof R. Apt and Tony Hoare edited a commemoration of Edsger Dijkstra written by more than twenty computer scientists who knew him as a colleague, teacher, and friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A blog devoted to Dijkstra’s works and thoughts has been created, and is being maintained, by the historian of computing Edgar G. Daylight. An article by Daylight, “Dijkstra’s Rallying Cry for Generalization: the Advent of the Recursive Procedure, late 1950s - early 1960s,” appeared in The Computer Journal, March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his blog A Programmer’s Place, Maarten van Emden has an entry entitled “Another scoop by Dijkstra?”. The entry describes Dijkstra’s “remarkable insight [in “Notes on Structured Programming” (EWD 249)] that resolves the stand-off between the Sieve of Eratosthenes (efficient in terms of time, but not memory) and the method of Trial Division (efficient in terms of memory, but not time)” by applying the Assembly-line Principle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing honors Dijkstra’s “foundational work on concurrency primitives (such as the semaphore), concurrency problems (such as mutual exclusion and deadlock), reasoning about concurrent systems, and self-stabilization [, which] comprises one of the most important supports upon which the field of distributed computing is built.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Dijkstra Memorial Lectures&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A series of annual lectures in memory of Dijkstra commenced at The University of Texas in October 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Machine Learning&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 24 Oct 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:The Principles of Diffusion Models&lt;/head&gt;View PDF&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data. Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers, and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning knowledge.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.LG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Marble Fountain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really enjoy procedural generation, especially systems designed to work with hardware outputs. After starting work at Formlabs in September of 2023 and gaining access to much nicer printers than I was used to, I started wanting to tackle some large algorithmic structure projects. Complexity is free in 3d printing, the limit of design geometry is mostly how much time you’re willing to spend in CAD. I wanted to print the most complicated art piece I could think of. Marble Fountain is what I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tracks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My initial system came together quickly. Randomly placing spaced out points, drawing a spline through them, and setting a constant slope just works. My first draft was just subtracting a tube from the solid support structure which worked but was super limited. I wanted to add more parts and so I started working on a path solver. I wanted to fit as much motion into the volume of the printer as possible. This turned out to be extremely challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solver starts by making a random series of line segments connecting the top and bottom of the lift. There are several different algorithms to generate this guess, as the initial conditional has a noticeable impact on the shape of the structure for lower path counts. It’s interesting to play with different variants of the starting conditions and see how they change during generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A series of functions update the positions over time to “pull” the points into a followable path. The points making up each path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stay in the bounding box&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Evenly space themselves out&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pull towards a fixed height to enforce a constant slope&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enforce min and max turning radius of the path&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repel away from other tracks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repel away from distant sections of our own track&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smooth out changes in slope to prevent jumps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prevent slope from ever increasing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Velocity is a much harder problem than I anticipated. The tracks break a lot of the obvious assumptions if you act like the marble is a point mass, as changing the bank of the track moves the axis of rotation and can burn off rotational inertia to friction. Long straight sections would build up too much speed and bearings fly off on the turns, but balls taking sharp turns at slow speed will lose too much momentum and stop. I settled on setting a minimum turn radius for the track and banking much more aggressively than is technically necessary for any given speed, so it constantly snakes back and forth to burn off speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most elegant designs of the whole structure is how the lift acts like a ball screw. The the screw is constrained by the balls on all sides which allows it to run with no bearing at the top. This also leads to a failure mode where if the screw ever only has balls on one side it will immediately start wobbling badly enough that all the balls currently rolling will fall off the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The support generation was surprisingly simple. Iterating from the top down and treating the support pillars as a particle system is quite robust. I spent more time tweaking the geometry for aesthetics than I did for actual structure and collision issues, although I did heavily lean on the overhang tolerance of the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pulls towards other supports, weighted by distance and similarity in size&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repels away from other supports&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pulls to stay in the bounding box&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pulls towards a fixed radius from the center of the structure&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supports also have inertia, which is where the arcs in the structure of the support columns come from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking forward&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final models take around 5-20 minutes to export. There’s a ton I could do to optimize the models, but at this point the geometry is simply beyond the scope of OpenSCAD. If I was rewriting this I would probably use a different tool more optimized for this type of organic geometry, likely an SDF library. I have vague ambitions to do a big rewrite eventually but figured sharing janky code is better than none. I started this just planning for the janky splines as a weekend project but it has gotten thoroughly out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a ton of other ideas to play with if I do that big rewrite. There is no realistic velocity estimation at any point in the whole system right now, just a pile of heuristics. I was originally trying to not overcomplicate but building a proper acceleration model by measuring velocity with a camera would have almost definitely saved time overall. Trying to maintain a fixed slope makes collision prevention much harder but is required to keep speed within bounds. At this point I’m also just curious about the response curve, there’s a knee somewhere where the surfaces start to slip that I want to track down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the most work I have ever put into a hobby project. I started in February 2024 and worked on it on and off until September. I applied to show it in a gallery (shoutout to New Alliance Gallery in Somerville) with two months of warning, which wound up leading to a large crunch trying to make the system reliable enough to show in person in the weeks before the show. I was able to get it working consistently, although it did lose 2-3 balls an hour and could only run for a few hours without the motor overheating. I got pretty burned out and dropped the project, which is why I shelved it for a full year before sharing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, a huge thanks to my friend Alex who listened to me ramble about marbles for several months every day while walking home from work, gave a ton of helpful input, and lived with the dozens of ball bearings scattered across our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government is reportedly preparing to ban the sale of wireless routers and other networking gear from TP-Link Systems, a tech company that currently enjoys an estimated 50% market share among home users and small businesses. Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link’s ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Washington Post recently reported that more than a half-dozen federal departments and agencies were backing a proposed ban on future sales of TP-Link devices in the United States. The story said U.S. Department of Commerce officials concluded TP-Link Systems products pose a risk because the U.S.-based company’s products handle sensitive American data and because the officials believe it remains subject to jurisdiction or influence by the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TP-Link Systems denies that, saying that it fully split from the Chinese TP-Link Technologies over the past three years, and that its critics have vastly overstated the company’s market share (TP-Link puts it at around 30 percent). TP-Link says it has headquarters in California, with a branch in Singapore, and that it manufactures in Vietnam. The company says it researches, designs, develops and manufactures everything except its chipsets in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TP-Link Systems told The Post it has sole ownership of some engineering, design and manufacturing capabilities in China that were once part of China-based TP-Link Technologies, and that it operates them without Chinese government supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“TP-Link vigorously disputes any allegation that its products present national security risks to the United States,” Ricca Silverio, a spokeswoman for TP-Link Systems, said in a statement. “TP-Link is a U.S. company committed to supplying high-quality and secure products to the U.S. market and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost is a big reason TP-Link devices are so prevalent in the consumer and small business market: As this February 2025 story from Wired observed regarding the proposed ban, TP-Link has long had a reputation for flooding the market with devices that are considerably cheaper than comparable models from other vendors. That price point (and consistently excellent performance ratings) has made TP-Link a favorite among Internet service providers (ISPs) that provide routers to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August 2024, the chairman and the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party called for an investigation into TP-Link devices, which they said were found on U.S. military bases and for sale at exchanges that sell them to members of the military and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“TP-Link’s unusual degree of vulnerabilities and required compliance with PRC law are in and of themselves disconcerting,” the House lawmakers warned in a letter (PDF) to the director of the Commerce Department. “When combined with the PRC government’s common use of SOHO [small office/home office] routers like TP-Link to perpetrate extensive cyberattacks in the United States, it becomes significantly alarming.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The letter cited a May 2023 blog post by Check Point Research about a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group dubbed “Camaro Dragon” that used a malicious firmware implant for some TP-Link routers to carry out a sequence of targeted cyberattacks against European foreign affairs entities. Check Point said while it only found the malicious firmware on TP-Link devices, “the firmware-agnostic nature of the implanted components indicates that a wide range of devices and vendors may be at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a report published in October 2024, Microsoft said it was tracking a network of compromised TP-Link small office and home office routers that has been abused by multiple distinct Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups since 2021. Microsoft found the hacker groups were leveraging the compromised TP-Link systems to conduct “password spraying” attacks against Microsoft accounts. Password spraying involves rapidly attempting to access a large number of accounts (usernames/email addresses) with a relatively small number of commonly used passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TP-Link rightly points out that most of its competitors likewise source components from China. The company also correctly notes that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups from China and other nations have leveraged vulnerabilities in products from their competitors, such as Cisco and Netgear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that may be cold comfort for TP-Link customers who are now wondering if it’s smart to continue using these products, or whether it makes sense to buy more costly networking gear that might only be marginally less vulnerable to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost without exception, the hardware and software that ships with most consumer-grade routers includes a number of default settings that need to be changed before the devices can be safely connected to the Internet. For example, bring a new router online without changing the default username and password and chances are it will only take a few minutes before it is probed and possibly compromised by some type of Internet-of-Things botnet. Also, it is incredibly common for the firmware in a brand new router to be dangerously out of date by the time it is purchased and unboxed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until quite recently, the idea that router manufacturers should make it easier for their customers to use these products safely was something of anathema to this industry. Consumers were largely left to figure that out on their own, with predictably disastrous results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But over the past few years, many manufacturers of popular consumer routers have begun forcing users to perform basic hygiene — such as changing the default password and updating the internal firmware — before the devices can be used as a router. For example, most brands of “mesh” wireless routers — like Amazon’s Eero, Netgear’s Orbi series, or Asus’s ZenWifi — require online registration that automates these critical steps going forward (or at least through their stated support lifecycle).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For better or worse, less expensive, traditional consumer routers like those from Belkin and Linksys also now automate this setup by heavily steering customers toward installing a mobile app to complete the installation (this often comes as a shock to people more accustomed to manually configuring a router). Still, these products tend to put the onus on users to check for and install available updates periodically. Also, they’re often powered by underwhelming or else bloated firmware, and a dearth of configurable options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone wants to fiddle with mobile apps or is comfortable with registering their router so that it can be managed or monitored remotely in the cloud. For those hands-on folks — and for power users seeking more advanced router features like VPNs, ad blockers and network monitoring — the best advice is to check if your router’s stock firmware can be replaced with open-source alternatives, such as OpenWrt or DD-WRT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These open-source firmware options are compatible with a wide range of devices, and they generally offer more features and configurability. Open-source firmware can even help extend the life of routers years after the vendor stops supporting the underlying hardware, but it still requires users to manually check for and install any available updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happily, TP-Link users spooked by the proposed ban may have an alternative to outright junking these devices, as many TP-Link routers also support open-source firmware options like OpenWRT. While this approach may not eliminate any potential hardware-specific security flaws, it could serve as an effective hedge against more common vendor-specific vulnerabilities, such as undocumented user accounts, hard-coded credentials, and weaknesses that allow attackers to bypass authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the brand, if your router is more than four or five years old it may be worth upgrading for performance reasons alone — particularly if your home or office is primarily accessing the Internet through WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NB: The Post’s story notes that a substantial portion of TP-Link routers and those of its competitors are purchased or leased through ISPs. In these cases, the devices are typically managed and updated remotely by your ISP, and equipped with custom profiles responsible for authenticating your device to the ISP’s network. If this describes your setup, please do not attempt to modify or replace these devices without first consulting with your Internet provider.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We traditionally divide consoles into “generations”—the earliest devices like the Magnavox Odyssey are the first generation, the Atari 2600 is second, the NES third, the SNES and Genesis fourth, the PlayStation fifth, and so on. These divisions turn out to be pretty slippery when you look at them more closely—generations don’t really match product lineage, raw power, or year of release all that closely at all. The closest we come to a real division is that consoles in the same generation competed against one another as peers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sega’s third generation may be the most blatant gap there. The SG-1000 came out on the very same day as the Famicom, and it is reckoned as a third-generation console. However, its actual hardware closely matches the ColecoVision, released less than a year before but which is firmly in the second generation. It doesn’t spread terribly far, either. Sega doesn’t make a major play for the international market until 1986, three years after the original SG-1000 release and one year after Nintendo started selling the Famicom internationally as the NES. The NES was a slightly modified Famicom—firmly 1983 tech, albeit very good 1983 tech that had been dominant in Japan for some time by this point. Sega’s offering—the “Master System”—was based on their “Mark III” console from 1985. Those extra two years were pretty busy ones in home computing—1985 in particular sees the release of the Amiga 1000 and the MSX2, both of which offered far more sophisticated graphics than their predecessors. (Indeed, the MSX 1 released the same year as the SG-1000 and had the same graphics chip!) The Master System manages a similar jump as the MSX 1-to-2 advance, or as the Atari 5200 did from the 2600 earlier in the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, much like the 5200, the Master System is reckoned as being in the same generation as its own predecessor, though unlike the 5200 the Master System is far more famous and successful than the system it succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(If you’re looking at the Japanese name of “Mark III” and assuming that the SG-1000 is the Mark I, you may be wondering where the Mark II went. The only real candidate for this is an SG-1000 in different packaging that came out along the way. We’re not missing anything important.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Head to Head&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Master System was clearly designed to compete directly with the Famicom, but it is also clearly designed to be a broadly-compatible upgrade to the SG-1000. Looking at what the system offers really requires us to compare it both to its predecessor and to its primary competitor. These sorts of comparisons are often a fool’s errand—in this era of home computing particularly, the core capabilities of different machines is so different even in operating principles that the only thing you can do is gesture at how they approached it—but these three systems all have enough in common in their core design that we are on firmer ground. It helps that the Master System’s VDP is explicitly a mostly-compatible upgrade to the SG-1000’s, and that the NES’s PPU is also very clearly inspired by the original principles of that 1979-era chip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU Memory. The SG-1000 matched the ColecoVision, with a single kilobyte of memory visible to the CPU. The Famicom doubled that to 2KB, and the Master System jumped it up to 8. In 1987, an expansion system for the Famicom was releaesd in Japan called the Famicom Disk System or FDS which loaded games off of floppy disks instead of cartridges, and it offered 32KB of additional RAM to actually load games into. This replaced the memory normally mapped to the cartridge ROM but could be used as working RAM by the games themselves.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Video Memory. The SG-1000 also matched the ColecoVision here, with a full 16KB of VRAM that enabled full use of all of its graphics modes. The SMS does not meaningfully expand it further; 16KB is enough for its enhanced graphics as well. The only addition on this side is that its palette information is stored in an independent “Color RAM” that only holds 32 bytes. The Famicom only offers 2KB of ordinary video RAM, with 32 bytes of palette RAM elsewhere in the VRAM space, and 256 bytes of “Object Attribute Memory” for sprite data also split out into its own 256-byte bank. 2KB of VRAM is impossibly small; the Famicom’s innovation here is that 8KB of the cartridge ROM is actually mapped directly into the VRAM’s address space as “character ROM” or “CHR-ROM.” Those 8KB are backed by fast RAM in some later cartridges, and the FDS also does this for its disk-based software, ultimately raising the total space available to a hair over 10KB.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ROM Capacity. The SG-1000 had a hard 32KB limit on the “Sega Cards” that held its games. The Master System expands the ROM space to 48KB and relies on a standardized bankswitching mechanism to allow cartridges to expand up to 512KB. The Famicom relied on more manufacturer-specific bespoke on-cartridge hardware for this capability, with Nintendo requiring standardization to a set of models of their design in the international markets. Famicom bankswitching was generally a bit more sophisticated because its 32KB of CPU ROM space and its 8KB of VROM space needed to be independently controlled. The FDS allowed disks to be swapped so the limit here was more the patience of the end user. By the end of the system’s lifecycle, the largest games for both the NES and Master System were about a megabyte in size.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Resolution. The SG-1000 and Master System both offer 256×192 displays, while the Famicom expands this to 256×240. In practice, the visible display for all three systems generally ends up more like 248×192 just because analog TVs didn’t render the whole signal visible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Color Depth. SG-1000 graphics modes are 1 bit per pixel, though sometimes specified at a high granularity allowing use of all the system’s colors. Famicom graphics are 2 bits per pixel, generally offering three colors plus a transparency. The Master System uses 4, allowing 15 non-transparent colors for any given graphic element.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Palette. The SG-1000 offers 15 unique colors that may be selected by various graphical elements but which may not be meaningfully remapped or arranged in palettes. The Master System offers 64 colors that are essentially a 6-bit RGB system, much like EGA graphics on the PC. From this a developer may create two 16-color palettes, one usable only by backgrounds and the other usable by backgrounds or sprites. The Famicom also offers 64 colors, but only 62 that are unique and usable, and arranged in a more miscellaneous way. From this gamut the developer again selects 32 colors, arranged into four palettes each for the background and sprites.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sprites. The SG-1000’s TMS9918A offers 32 8×8 or 16×16 monochrome sprites, 4 of which may be active on any given scanline. The NES and Master System both offer 64 sprites, up to 8 active per scanline, that may either all be 8×8 or 8×16. Both Sega systems have a status bit that reports if any two sprites have collided, though it does not tell you which ones; the Famicom has a very strange sprite collision detector that works only for the first sprite and only checks for collisions against the background. More on this later.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backgrounds and Scrolling. The SG-1000’s TMS9918A graphics chip offers a great many graphics modes, which I have documented in detail before. None of these meaningfully permit scrolling without rewriting the entire name table. The Master System defines a 32×28 graphics display, and any point within it may be designated the upper-left corner. The VDP lets one turn off the leftmost column of graphics, which gives the room necessary to smoothly scroll the screen in any direction. The Famicom offers enough VRAM for two side-by-side background screens, and these are arranged by the cartridge logic to be either aligned horizontally or vertically. Due to the way backgrounds are encoded, it is significantly more difficult to completely hide scroll seams when scrolling diagonally on the NES. Even highly regarded late-era games like Super Mario Bros. 3 and Mega Man 3 have obvious glitches sometimes. All systems that support scrolling effectively support it by having the developer write X and Y scroll values to a pair of control registers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VDP Register and VRAM Access. All of these systems access VRAM in similar ways. There is a “control port” to which the developer writes a two-byte address, and then a “data port” to which bytes are then written or read in sequence. The SG-1000 and Master System treat registers almost like a special kind of VRAM; registers are set by writing two command bytes to the VDP control port. Most of the Famicom’s registers, on the other hand, are directly mapped into the CPU’s address space starting at &lt;code&gt;$2000&lt;/code&gt;. The big exception is the 16-bit internal VRAM pointer, which is adjusted by writes to&lt;code&gt;$2005&lt;/code&gt;(when editing scrolling values) and&lt;code&gt;$2006&lt;/code&gt;(when doing more ordinary byte-oriented VRAM access).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Timing Restrictions. Both Sega systems maintain a fairly strict buffer between the developer and the VDP’s internal state. As a result, it is possible on both systems for command or data bytes to be “missed” by the VDP if they are overwritten before it can spare time to actually check its inputs. The Famicom exposes its internals much more directly to the developer, and all writes to any control register take effect, for all practical purposes, immediately. The timing restrictions on the Famicom instead are more macro-scale; the 16-bit internal VRAM pointer is used by the PPU for fetching the data required to draw the backgrounds, so attempting to access VRAM outside of VBLANK is likely to end up reading or writing the wrong locations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Split Screens and Raster Effects. The SG-1000 offers no particular support for mid-frame configuration updates to allow for split-screen or other raster-level effects. The Famicom’s bizarre single-sprite collision detection is intended to trap exactly these cases; developers were expected to engineer a sprite-to-background collision at the appropriate split point and then edit control registers as needed at that point. As noted above, mid-screen PPU state is fragile enough that it was challenging to do much besides split-screen scrolling, but that was usually enough. Later cartridges included circuitry that could count scanlines and set interrupts to occur at specific points on the screen. The Master System backed similar hardware directly into its VDP, allowing for multiple regularly-spaced interrupts over the course of a screen. However, as part of its buffering of state away from the developer, vertical scrolling values could not actually be changed mid-frame. To account for this, it includes a special extra hardware mode that simply excludes the top two rows or right eight columns of the display from scrolling, prefiguring the “window layer” we’d later see in the Genesis and the Game Boy.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the themes that emerges from this is a difference in design philosophies—and one that I think extends at least out to the SNES and Genesis, too. Sega’s designs are more “down-to-earth”; programming it generally feels to me like “ask for this capability that was designed-in, and get it.” Nintendo’s systems, on the other hand, generally feel like they need to me to combine a number of independent mechanisms to get the result. (Compare the Master System’s hardwired split-screen to the Sprite 0-hit mechanism on the NES, for instance, or the wild profusion of effects on the SNES that boil down to “combine the HDMA subsystem with some other feature“.) As part of this, the Sega designs also retain a lot of the safeguards that Nintendo’s chips scrapped. Before this year I figured that the Genesis VDP let me write VRAM during active display thanks to the 16-bit era finally letting us get proper bus arbiters; that feature actually goes all the way back to 1979 and it was Nintendo’s PPUs that dropped the capability. In dropping it, and removing any barrier between the user-accessible VRAM pointer and the values used to drive the active display, Nintendo ended up accidentally permitting a wider array of raster-scrolling effects than they thought were possible originally. (We know they did not plan the effects used in Rockman 6 originally, because The Legend of Zelda does not exploit them and the display glitches a bit as a result. The Master System goes out of its way to make itself a more solid foundation—but a more solid foundation is also less flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nintendo approach ends up looked on more kindly later on, I think—there’s room for the console’s power to grow with the expertise of its developer community—but I will freely admit that in the moment programming systems that use the Sega approach is more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cartridge Structure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cartridges had standard sizes from 8KB through 1MB, and there were 16 bytes of identifying information at the end of the first 32KB. (Cartridges shorter than 32KB just had it as their last 16 bytes.) This included a simple checksum, though I’ve gotten the impression that some models didn’t enforce it so some commercial software didn’t respect it either. Nevertheless, for my own work I created a simple “SMSFIX” utility that would expand simple assembled binaries to an appropriate size and document that appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple cartridges smaller than 32KB just loaded their entire contents into the first 32KB of RAM, mirroring themselves if necessary. Larger ones made use of a standard memory mapper and this only locked in the lowest 1KB of RAM. Somewhere in that code the developer was obliged to configure the memory-mapping registers, and Sega’s recommended approach for this was to lock down the lowest 32KB and then swap out the &lt;code&gt;$8000-$BFFF&lt;/code&gt; region with 16KB blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Writing a BIOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RAM, I/O port, and VDP design of the Master System were designed to be largely backwards-compatible with the SG-1000. This means that I should be able to reuse the earlier work I did creating a BIOS-like support library for the SG-1000 and adapt it pretty readily to the Master System as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it turned out, attempting this worked so well that it made more sense to just block out the changes under some conditional-assembly defines like &lt;code&gt;ifdef SMS&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ifdef SG1000&lt;/code&gt; and only make the necessary alterations in those places:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The SMS has four additional I/O ports that we should define.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The stack pointer starts in a different place since we have more RAM.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Likewise, we have more memory to clear when we clear RAM during startup.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Color RAM must be cleared on its own on the Master System since it’s not just part of VRAM the way the SG-1000’s color tables were.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;While the SG-1000’s VDP was highly configurable, and the SMS’s VDP has just as many knobs attached, there was an acknowledged canonical memory layout for the SMS that made good use of the entire 16KB of VRAM. We should initialize the VDP to that known-good configuration on startup.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are two possible IRQ sources on the Master System; our built-in handler should be able to identify mid-frame interrupts, and both skip the frame-only operations on those and also forward them to an alternate handler.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We also should initialize the mapper circuitry, if any.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One thing I expected to need but didn’t turn out to need was a special call for writing values to color RAM. It turns out that the way I’d implemented the various VRAM-writing functions effectively mapped the 16KB of VRAM proper to &lt;code&gt;$0000-$3FFF&lt;/code&gt;and then the 32 bytes of CRAM to&lt;code&gt;$8000-$801F&lt;/code&gt;. I’ll take it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The official documentation for the Master System suggested an additional complication: when it described the VDP timing requirements it suggested that the Master System’s VDP needed to be written more slowly than the SG-1000’s. It purported to require a 16-cycle gap between writes during VBLANK and a 29-cycle gap during active display. My own calculations agreed with the 29-cycle number but only expected an 8-cycle gap needed during VBLANK. Enthusiasts at the SMS Power Forum actually did the timing experiments and discovered that the VBLANK number is closer to 3 cycles (impossible to violate on a Z80) and that the active-display value was more like 26 cycles. I’m going to stick with my SG-1000-level timing here, but we may be pretty confident that this will work out fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Project Plans&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was port over my sample Hello World program to make sure that my SMSFIX program and my adapted BIOS actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving forward, after learning about how much the Master System actually offered, I realized that I could actually recreate one of my first Sega Genesis projects over to the Master System with effectively no compromises. After that I think I’m going to want to create some more ambitious display, pushing right up to the level where we’d start really wanting the power of the Genesis to enhance it further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the rest of the systems I’ve poked at this year, the Master System really feels both very familiar, yet shockingly powerful given the expectations I brought in. This should be a fun time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Finally making a simulation of my heat engine. It's kind of like stirling engine, but working on entirely novel cycle, theoretically should be able to achieve over 80-90% efficiency (yes, more than Carnot theorem says). I had this idea for 15 years already, but didn't have enough free time to make prototype. Now I don't have much time, but thanks to AI I have kickstarted simulation program (it told me which equations to use and how, I do most of my programming myself), turns out it's not as hard as I've imagined when you know which equations to use. Still working on it at max several hours a week because I have two other programming jobs. If it works, it will noticeably bump humanity on Kardashev scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This game was Show HNed two times in ten days, [1][2], but unfortunately, it didn't get as much attention as it should! Ironically, this current thread has already gained almost double the comments from both submissions combined!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I whish you best of luck to succeed in your journey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good fun. I discovered a big though. I could not yet reproduce it, but I managed to somehow have letters glitch out of the Tetris shapes they are in. When I move the tiles or rotate them, the letters are back where they should be. So it's not game breaking, but seems to happen in some case. At first I suspected, that it was because my phone was locked in between, but I tried that and when locking it manually, that bug did not happen. So no idea, sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really great! One of the things that Wordle did that I thought was very clever was having a copy and paste social media preview of how you did. It might be worth adding that for vitality... you could even add an image preview with Open Graph meta tags if you were clever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice! What might be a nice lesser 'clue' to simply revealing a word is highlighting letter(s) on the board that are part of it? Favouring maybe highlighting letters that are contiguous with a blue bit?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice! Some feedback from my wife, who is into all manner of word games: she found it a little bit brute-forcey: needing to try all different combinations in order to get the right configuration of the word. In contrast to a crossword where there is already a layout, which gives her a hint for how to proceed with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(She finished today's puzzle, and I gave up.) From a UI perspective it is very slick - very smooth, and I like how it kind of "gets" what you were trying to do when providing corrections/hints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I saw your Show HN post a few weeks ago! Really appreciate the smoothness of your UI and the simplicity of your onboarding, I see how much you have dialed in. I've been working on a daily puzzle game too (it's getting there...), maybe you'd enjoy it https://slab17.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is really fun — have you played with making the tile position opinionated (not agnostic)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i wonder if have the clues point to a starting square (e.g., "E5") would be better than the current "reveal" aid. The spatial information would become more helpful toward the end when the player is dealing with the words they need help on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice work. I liked the instant pdf viewer. Kudos for your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only thing I would suggest is, to support different tax formats (or provide an ability to fill custom tax format name that applies to the whole invoice). Right now, it is largely VAT. In some countries, it may not be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Having said that, as a work around, currently anyone can use Notes field to fill custom tax details and hide all VAT related fields.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think by this point everyone that is learning a language knows that immersion is very important, however a problem I've had myself is that the content that interests me is beyond my reach, and the content that is within reach doesn't interest me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my attempt at doing something to remediate that. You select the content you want, and I create a personalized study plan to learn the most important words to achieve a target % of understanding. Then I generate a short story each week for your particular level containing the new words in the context of your content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to bring the content you want to learn to your level so you can watch what you want to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- News, weather, newsletters, social media posts, reddit, youtube, etc. all appear in your digest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Launching a mobile app as well now but this will be slightly different than the web app. It will use AI to automatically prepare your daily digest based on preferences/settings you give it during onboarding. Each day when you wake up you'll receive a notification of digest being ready, and it will contain all the content you care about for the day ahead (meetings, weather, health data, commute data, news, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on a take on Pokémon GO + Pokémon Snap but for birding. The goal is to explore your neighborhood, find birds, take good photos of them all. Next month, I'll be doing an event to find a rare bird, excited to see how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have been building https://finbodhi.com/ a local-first browser app (PWA) for personal finance, based on double-entry accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FinBodhi uses double entry so complicated set of transactions and accounts can be modeled (which happen often enough in users financial journey). We wrote about double-entry here: https://finbodhi.com/docs/understanding-double-entry&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do use online services like firebase for auth, and some service to fetch commodity prices etc. But all your financial data is on your system (we use sqlite over opfs, in browser). For synching across devices, that data is encrypted with your key before it leaves your device. You can backup the data locally (if you are using chrome) and/or to your dropbox. It's designed so that we (the people building it) can't access your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many more features, like multi-currency, visualizations, a sheet to use your data to do complex calculations like taxes, planning for your future etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feel free to try it out with the demo account (no sign-in required). Note: app doesn't work in Firefox private mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Import is done locally. No 3rd party is involved. We have build custom importer. e.g you can import a csv and map it's columns to what we need internally. We also allow some logic in importer. E.g. to figure if a row is credit or debit. etc. It should be feasible to import most csv statements. PDFs and Excels should also work, except for some complicated cases where a transaction is spread across multiple rows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few custom importers also, for indian context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An algorithm to optimise vacation days using public holidays and weekends. Especially relevant at this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created it a year ago and received quite some comments on the Show HN post[1]. Last weekend I updated it to work for end of year planning and adding fixed days off, which seems to solve most of the feedback. It was done with Cursor in agent mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each player drafts cards that represent ways you can spend your limited time on earth to gather resources (wisdom, gold, and virtue) to complete your own personal player board (your hierarchy of needs) with the goal of reaching self-actualization before other players. However, you can still win without becoming self-actualized, if you complete more hidden quests (which can only be discarded by the "therapy session" card).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to say, i love this. The name is fantastic and the whole concept. It's got a very Game of Life or Monopoly feel where you've just taken the fundamentals of something in society and turned it into a game instead of adding an additional story on top. I really like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My one comment would be, I think you need to change the branding a little bit. It's a bit too close to Magic the Gathering, and this feels like its own IP and can stand on its own legs. So I think you need to just adjust the cards enough so they don't instantly read as a Magic the Gathering card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was getting a little bored of retrocomputing discourse being so centered on gaming, so I'm exploring the productivity software of the 8/16-bit era. I put real effort into learning and using the programs, giving my light-hearted but heartfelt assessment of its form and function for both its time and today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the software inevitably gets me thinking about other things, and I explore those threads as well. For example, "Superbase on the C64" also discusses the legacy and promise of "the paperless office." A couple of other posts got some nice traction here on HN, notably "Deluxe Paint on the Amiga" and "VisiCalc on the Apple 2".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm hoping to build a strong monthly readership, so I'm putting in the work. It's been up for two months and five posts now, with a new one coming at the end of this week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this software archaeology / history-keeping is really important. Keep up the good work. These paragraphs resonate with me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; There is utility in those old tools and interesting ideas to be mined. Recently I stumbled across something that by all accounts should have set the world on fire, but whose ideas needed more time to germinate before blossoming much later. Discoveries like this are not just nostalgic “what ifs” to opine wistfully upon, they can be dormant seeds of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Computing moves at such an unrelenting pace, those seeds may lie dormant for any number of reasons: bad marketing, released on a dying platform, too expensive, or even too large a mental leap for the public to “get” at the time. I see this blog as a way to explore the history of the work tools we use every day. I don’t do this out of misty-eyed sentimentality, but rather pragmatic curiosity. The past isn’t sacred, but it is still useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's your research process? Do you use lots of Internet Archive material? Do you reference any personal artifacts i.e. old hardware or documentation laying around? Any interviewing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for the kind feedback, and I'm happy you felt resonance with those words. I use tons of Internet Archive material, but also stuff from various retro enthusiast sites which focus on specific hardware platforms. Lots of books, I look through YouTube for interviews, and include my own personal history with the machines and genres (I don't want the blog to read like a passionless how-to manual). If I had the physical space for a hardware collection I'd do that, but alas. No interviewing of my own, just research into existing interviews up to present day. The main point is really to let the software speak for itself and see if it and I can be friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! I don't actually know anything about how Ghost blogging platform interacts with RSS feeds, but I get a small amount of traffic from personal aggregation services. I guess I kind of thought RSS is enabled, but I don't use it so I honestly don't know. I'll look into it and see if there's some setting or toggle switch somewhere I need to flip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interface is optimized to let you quickly explore and tweak multiple tints/shades at once so you can customize all colors exactly how you want e.g. try dragging vertically through the saturation curve in one motion to edit all the tints/shades at once, or shift whole curves horizontally by dragging between the dots on a curve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses the HSLuv color space, where (unlike say HSL) the WCAG contrast stays the same when you change the hue and saturation sliders. This makes it much easier to explore accessible colors choices as you know only changes to the lightness slider will impact the contrast. You can also switch from the WCAG2 contrast checker to using APCA, which is meant to correct for inaccuracies in WCAG2, such as it being too forgiving for dark mode color combos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the mobile version is more of a preview and the desktop version has more features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I probably need to add something like a tutorial as there's a lot going on, but I've added more hints and tooltips recently. Open to feedback on what's initially confusing and what changes might help!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a charity + website (not live yet) that allows you to centrally manage your charity donations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm in Germany so I'm working on a Germany-specific solution for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- you choose from a list of charities (right now I'm working with the list from the https://dzi.de plus a few such as Wikimedia Deutschland)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- you setup a recurring donation to our bank account&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- we redistribute the money according to your split&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- no spam in your email and snail mail&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- one pdf at the end of the year for your tax returns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not planning on taking any cut of the donations obviously, so this will be a fully self-funded project at first, but I'll reach-out to foundations once I'm up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a tool for managing Google Ads campaing called Rudys.AI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Search campaigns: - automatically crawl website, find the offerings and generate new campaigns - Provide qualitative recommendations such as, relevant terms to include/exclude, e.g. including typos as keywords, improvements on landing page&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Shopping campaign: - Smart labeling of all products to allocate the budget among Top performers, Rising and Ghost products to avoid draining the budget. E.g. instead of a campaign with 10k products with one budget , turn it into 5 campaigns with different budgets doubling down on what works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on “Stripe Integration as a Library.” It seems that whenever someone uses Stripe, for example for subscriptions, they go through the same few steps: creating a database table, setting up webhooks, and implementing the events they care about. The challenge of course is that everyone uses a different stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building this using our framework for stack-agnostic JS/TS libraries. On the database side, we currently support Drizzle and Kysely, with Prisma support coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on https://canine.sh which is a free, open source Heroku alternative for 2 years now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s exactly the product I wish I had when I started my previous company. Running on PaaS is incredible for devex but the pricing is bonkers, and the vendor lock in makes it really hard to deal with annual price increases. We spent close to 400k / year for just 128GB combined fleet in our last startup on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Canine tries to get the best of both worlds: developer friendly PaaS with no lockin or price gouging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just added build packs as a build option recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also got a sponsorship from the portainer folks which lets me work on this close to full time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hoping this saves someone the headache I had two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discovered in-door bouldering / rock climbing and now go 3x a week, am absolutely loving it! Because of that, I haven't really worked on any side projects in a while. Perhaps I don't need to? My job advances me plenty in my field, but it is a bit of a bitter-sweet feeling in a sense, like maybe I should try to squeeze more out of my free time somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I climb a lot! (Actually currently sitting on Big Sur ledge on el cap posting this). It cuts into my free time programming for sure, but imo super worth it! Enjoy it, it’s a wonderful hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m replying from the cold east coast (from the edge of a wood chair in a lovely iykyk type of restaurant) to a human posting from el cap on hn; We have achieved peak technology. Oh yeah, I’m working on urban logistics, powered by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been hesitant for fear of injury harming the ability to type, but might give it a go in the spring. Thanks for mentioning this I’m inspired to try it finally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Couple things to avoid finger injuries: go easy on one- and two-finger pockets, use an open crimp whenever possible (all finger joints are bent the normal direction, and your palm/thumb aren't really involved), and don't bother with the hangboard or campus board for the first ~year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wouldn't worry about it too much though - almost all of the people I know with finger injuries were trying to push into really being competitive climbers, not just doing it casually for fun/fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh also to keep from tearing your skin don't climb tired. (That won't keep you from typing, it's just painful.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd like to add to this that do not make any food with chilli peppers like habanero or such if you just came from the gym with torn skin. I found out the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I struggled with hand and wrist pain for years from spending too much time at a computer. I did physiotherapy for years and while it helped me manage pain, I was never able to truly build enough strength to get ahead of it until I started bouldering. I took it very slowly—I spent months on very easy problems—but because it was so much fun, I kept going back. Initially, I would only go on Saturday mornings, so I had the full weekend to recover before jumping back into the work week on Monday. After a two or three months of that, I was able to climb anytime I wished. I'm still not a particularly advanced climber, and I typically only go once per week, but I am still slowly progressing, and I absolutely love it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been climbing for 20 years and it’s the thing that prevents RSI for me and makes it possible to use a computer too much :). Certainly possible to injure fingers but would be a very rare climbing injury that would threaten coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love the intense concentration for martial arts, but I had to stop because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never had a serious injury. Instead it would be minor injuries, that would make my ring finger 20% less responsive, that would totally mess up my typing cadence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried capoeira, a non-contact martial art, for a while. This wasn’t as good for me as Taekwondo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climbing easy routes in a gym is pretty low impact. It’s only when you start to move into really hard crimps or slopers where you’ll hurt yourself. I was a climber bum for years and have climbed crazy stuff around the world and never hurt myself to where I couldn’t type. A lot of bloody tape, but still able to type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try top rope climbing! Bouldering is injury prone because every fall is a ground fall. With top rope climbing you should never hit the ground so way less injury prone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few of my recent favorites: - swim lap counter in html/JS that uses the camera to watch you swim and count laps/timing - video recorder that records your window/desktop and uploads a file to S3 - video conferencing app that allows a 2 year to click on a family member face and initiates a video conference using webRTC, STUN, and browser audio/video capture with automatic bandwidth adjustments (works on all platforms with pure HTML/JS). - CUDA based ray tracer with HTML UI that can trace over 2m rays per second on my laptop for scientific study, allowing real-time display of optical parts. - chat front-end for image models like gemini-pro and openai that take other images and text as references and generate a big library of options to chose from in seconds, I've been using photoshop for decades but I tend to use this more now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm curious if you mean they're running a raytracer on the back end, and you interact with an HTML UI, or if it runs browserside, maybe via WASM. AFAIK CUDA isn't directly compilable to WASM (yet?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a node middleman that proxies request from an HTML/JS front end to a native cuda process using web sockets. To support multiple windows, the node process process provides communication between two browser windows. This lets me have render a model using 3JS in one window and a ray traced version in another window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an explorable database of films, TV shows, books and board games based around their historical setting: where and when the thing is set. It's been incredibly complex and interesting getting the (messy) data, making sense of it and trying to design a UI to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, that's a whole different thing. I saw this map once that showed places in California and how they were used to film various locations around the world. Turns out LA is very well situated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Solitairle – a Yukon solitaire game where every board is guaranteed solvable: https://solitairle.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Most solitaire apps frustrate players with impossible games or endless randomness. Solitairle is designed for people (like me) who want a satisfying win through skill, not luck. Every day brings a new, solvable challenge, complete with helpful tools (back button, dead-end warnings) to keep it fun and frustration-free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m especially interested in feedback from people who:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enjoy casual puzzle games but get discouraged by unwinnable setups,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Value clean, minimalist interfaces without ads,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have ideas for daily challenges or fun player stats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love your thoughts: What frustrates you most about digital solitaire? What would make you want to play daily?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's very interesting because the Ruby codebase uses a `typedef uintptr_t VALUE` type to mean any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A pointer to the heap&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A Ruby tagged value (which may be a pointer to the heap)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Any integer value that fits in `uintptr_t`&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fil-C doesn't allow you to carry around pointers using integers, in the sense that when you do that, the pointers lose their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in Ruby's case, it's not as simple as changing the typedef to a pointer type, since `VALUE` variables often end up being used for integer math (including bit math, shifts, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, it's going to take a nontrivial patch to Ruby to get it to work in Fil-C. I think I'm about 70% of the way through (I started Friday afternoon).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Pocketdata - a personal, private AI data plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to take boring components: PostgreSQL, Bifrost (LLM gateway), Open WebUI, LanceDB, Agentgateway (MCP and OpenAPI gateway) and deploy them in Fly.io. One Fly.io "org" per user. The closest equivalent is blaxel.ai, but it caters for AI SaaS startups, not individual customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The combination of the fact that Fly secrets are visible only from within the apps, distroless containers, and transparent data encryption for PostgreSQL assures that the service (Pocketdata) provider cannot access their data, only the infrastructure provider (Fly.io) theoretically can, but practically speaking, this gives an extremely high degree of privacy assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey! Your project looks very similar, from a conceptual point of view, to what I'm doing with https://github.com/superegodev/superego. Would you like to have a chat about it? Email in my profile, if you're interested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks good! It feels a little bit similiar to ReScript. I like the idea to have nodeMain, browserMain and buildMain. The Roc language had something similiar with platforms and I love that idea!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general I prefer a better language over an involved javascript framework that does not look like js anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built a local-first Kanban board with Tauri (Rust + Svelte) after getting frustrated with SaaS tools and basic offline options. Stores data in JSON files you control, full keyboard-first UX, parent/child tasks, release management, and it's blazingly fast with localStorage + background sync. No telemetry, purely local. Curious what others prioritize in personal task tools. Seems like there's a gap between "todo.txt" simplicity and Jira complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cool. Love Tauri. So the whole board dataset is stored in localStorage? If you get to a point where the size limitations or synchronous blocking operations are an issue might consider using IndexedDB. There is a nice higher level wrapper around it called Dexie that has full TS typing support and a nice async API. https://dexie.org/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m still using redmine. It allows me to create a project, break it down in to tasks, assign time estimates for the tasks, assign % complete, log time against tasks, which then allows for burn down charts so I can see if I am on track or behind. With time logged against projects I can generate timesheets and invoices. It also has Gantt chart which is handy for initial project planning meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a platform that makes it easy for people in West Africa to buy and sell cryptocurrencies (like USDT, USDC, ETH, BNB, POL, AVAX, etc.) directly with mobile money — the most popular payment method in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to bridge crypptocurrencies and local mobile wallets to make crypto useful in everyday life — not just for trading, but also for online payments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few key features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mobile money integration (MTN, Moov, Orange, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instant buy/sell of USDT, USDC, ETH, and other assets&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crypto payment gateway — businesses can now accept stablecoin payments directly on their websites&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m currently focused on improving liquidity and expanding to more countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love feedback from the community — especially around :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Liquidity and Marketing to find the first users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy to share more details or collaborate with anyone working on similar problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eternal Vault is interesting. I would for sure use something like this. However, only if there is a strong story how the vault will survive 20+ years, even if your company is defunct. I do see the pieces scattered around the website (backup to Dropbox, etc), but this story needs to be front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi Luke, thanks for the feedback. Will be working on improving the marketing site to share the story in better way, any other feedbacks are also appreciated. Lastly, would love for you to give the platform a try at https://dash.eternalvault.app/register&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a 3D voxel-based game engine for like 10 years in my spare time. At this point it's getting pretty close to being shadertoy for voxels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks inside each file to see what it’s about, then moves it to the right folder with a single click. Everything happens on your Mac, so nothing leaves your computer. No clouds, no servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It already works with images, Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) PDFs, ePubs, text, Markdown, and many other file types (30+) in English. Next I’m adding multi-language support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have messy folders anywhere on your Mac, Floxtop can help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building the world’s first “Travel Confidence Engine.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been obsessed with how people actually make travel decisions — not how platforms think they do. From a consumer’s standpoint, travel isn’t just “search → compare → book.” It’s emotional, contextual, and full of FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You open 20 tabs across Booking, Google Maps, Reddit, and Instagram trying to answer simple questions like: Is this the right area? Is this hotel actually good? Am I missing a better deal somewhere else?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most existing tools either oversimplify (like ChatGPT giving three confident but unverifiable answers) or hide information behind algorithms and commissions (like OTAs). Both remove choice — and ironically, make people less confident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building SearchSpot, a “Cursor for travel.” It automatically does what power travelers already do manually — cross-check reviews, verify real photos, compare prices across platforms — and then shows its reasoning transparently so you understand why something was recommended or excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal isn’t to replace your decisions, but to help you close your tabs with confidence. From FOMO to flow. From chaos to clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever spent hours researching a trip just to end up more confused, I’d love your thoughts: https://searchspot.ai/home&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;yeah, but there's no way to reach out for feedback or follow ups if not logged in. At this stage, we want loads of feedbacks and help genuine users plan their trips well, hence the login wall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I saw a tweet from @awilkinson: “I just found out how much we pay for DocuSign and my jaw dropped. What's the best alternative?” Me being naive, I thought “how hard could would it actually be to build a free e-sign tool?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out not that hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In about a weekend, I built a UETA and ESIGN compliant tool. And it was free. And it cost me less than $50. Unlimited free e-sign. https://useinkless.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exposure to unity has got me thinking hard about its non-gaming applications. The stability of presentation between device targets is incredible. Being able to integrate literally anything you want in native 3d world space feels like a natural next step once you get bored of the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey HN! I'm building https://openfret.com/ - the all-in-one platform for guitarists that I wish existed when I started playing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenFret combines everything a guitarist needs in one place: smart gear inventory management, AI-powered practice sessions, real-time collaboration tools, and a vibrant community. Think of it as "GitHub for guitarists" meets comprehensive practice tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Core features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1) Smart Guitar Inventory: Track your collection with auto-filled specs from thousands of guitar models. Monitor woods, pickups, scale length, string changes, and discover patterns in your gear&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2) AI Practice Sessions: Generate personalized guitar tabs and lessons based on your practice history, with VexFlow sheet music and integrated metronome&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3) Session Mode: Fork and merge music tracks like code. Layer recordings, see version history, and collaborate with musicians worldwide&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4) Practice Analytics: Persistent timers, song tracking (Last.fm integration), scale visualization, fretboard maps, and chord progressions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5) Built-in Tools: Guitar tuner with frequency control, Strudel integration for backing tracks, and musical helpers to break out of E minor habits&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feedback from guitarists/musicians on which features resonate most&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm making Easel, a 2D game programming language designed to match how humans, not computers, think about game logic. It also has automatic multiplayer. I've been working on it for 3 years!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easel feels like a declarative programming language even though it is imperative, because lots of useful game-oriented features are first class. Like behaviours - you just say `on Pointer { ... }` and you have a concurrently-executing coroutine that's lifetime is managed. But you don't think about any of that complexity, you just think of your entity as having a behaviour and go forth and make your game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also happens to have automatic multiplayer. Normally with multiplayer you have to worry about doing everything in a "multiplayer safe" way (i.e. be deterministic and only modify the things your side has authority over). My idea was to put all the multiplayer stuff in the programming language itself, underneath all your lines of code. This way, anything you write in that programming language can just be made multiplayer, automatically. So you can just pretend all your players are in one shared world, like a singleplayer game, and the engine does all the multiplayer for you. It was really difficult to make but it makes multiplayer so easy for you now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easel is my idea of how games should be made, or at least as close to the idea as I can achieve with 3 years of work, and I would love for more people to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would love to hear more about what you were trying to do with your project before. Was it more similar to the declarative coding part, the automatic multiplayer part, or something else? Part of why I'm doing this is to explore the design space of how games should be made and I'm interested to hear what problems, issues, pet peeves, "bugbears" etc that other people think are worth solving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been a while. But I believe what caused me the most headache while trying to build something like this was handling the interactions between different elements. Declaring which objects were affected by "attacks" or could be "player interactive" or "affected by player but not by NPC". Really this boiled down to proper inheritance. But I found myself so deep and tangled a fresh reset would have been better. Then determining if the object itself or an "objective manager" should perform the calculation each cycle.. etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was messy. I ended up having NPC, Item, Attack classes and for each a NPC Manager, Item Manager, and Attack Manager to calculate all their interactions and states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's why your project seems interesting because it seems to handle the heavy lifting of behaviors and "behind the scenes".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh yes, handling interactions and dependencies and what is affected by what. I did a lot of React development (as in the frontend web framework) before making Easel and was quite inspired by how it hooks to change. The way you give it a little routine, it says what it depends on, and then it just fully re-executes that whole routine when the dependencies change. So in Easel when you say `with Health { ... }` it makes a behaviour that re-executes every time the Health changes. But, if it just reran the behaviour, then you'd end up with it adding a new sprite (for example) every time it re-executes, until you've got hundreds of them. So the other trick is the Easel compiler assigns an implicit ID to things like sprites so that it will replace rather than add the second time around. It's built into the programming language so you don't see it (most of the time). It actually took me 2 years to come up with that, which is both cool and depressing when I can explain it in one paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to see if I could use generative AI to build a whole business. Not just a digital product or an app — but the entire business from end to end:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Spoiler: I did manage it and launched in just 75 days from start to first order)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Three tier corporate structure with manager-managed LLCs and a private WY LLC as manager, complete with a knowledgebase-powered assistant that can write share registries, banking resolutions, meeting minutes, contribution contracts, loans and more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Supply chain management with proprietary lot tracking that tracks PO line items from production to delivery&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Generated the base for all product images, helped write and research label design and text, wrote SEO titles and product descriptions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Used Claude Code to build the entire Shopify theme for the site, all collections, product pages, legal pages and a COA database to boot&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Used Claude Code to build a custom Shopify app to integrate lot tracking into the shop so that when lots sell out the next lot is queued for sale and all lot-related metadata is synced to the product variant and displayed on the product page&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- used Claude Code to build a super analytics platform that combines the data from GA4, Shopify orders, and Meta business suite into a single feature store where I can wrangle the data to ask/answer any question I can dream of about audience segments, product popularity, what’s working or not, and get insights on what to do next&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small webapp that allows musicians to add PDFs locally and offline, arrange them, then download for use on an e-reader during performances. Built for a classical musician friend who uses really old Android devices, also my first almost entirely 'vibe-coded' app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Flavia, an ultra-low latency voice AI data analyst that can join your meetings. You can throw in data(csv's, postgres db's, bigquery, posthog analytics for now) and you just talk and ask questions. Using cerebras(2000 tokens per second) and very low latency sandboxes on the fly, you can get back charts/tables/analysis in under 1 second. (excluding time of the actual SQL query if you are doing bigquery).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She can also join your google meet or teams meetings, share her screen and then everyone in the meeting can ask questions and see live results. Currently being used by product managers and executives for mainly analytics and data science use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We plan to open-source it soon if there is demand. Very fast voice+actions is the future imo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great feedback thanks! We have added a synthetic e-commerce dataset as an example when you sign up so you can test it without your data first. Will also add a demo video ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What kind of plan do you have with Cerebras? It seems like something like that would need one of the $1500/month plans at least if there were more than a handful of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They introduced pay as you go recently. The limits on that is similar to the plans, 1 million tokens per minute, so if you stack a few keys and do a simple load balancing with redis, can cover a decent amount of traffic with no upfront cost. Eventually we would have to go enterprise though yes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm atm working on a couple of things, first the biz, a self-hosted home server OS that simplifies Docker management and provides a unified dashboard for running services at home. The goal is making self-hosting more accessible without sacrificing flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And also building as a hobbie a procedural universe generation engine that simulates galaxies, solar systems and planets in real-time. Everything is generated from a seed with actual orbital physics, seasonal changes and so... Built with Python/Flask backend too but Three.js for 3D visualization and React instead of Vue3 as in the prior one. Think No Man's Sky vibes but as an explorable simulation engine really D:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently launched my free app for gardeners to share plants with each other, Plantshare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I'm working on a few changes to the app, most notable is moving any plants marked as 'for sale' out from the main section because it turns out people are more greedy than I anticipated and it's getting in the way of sharing the free stuff, cuttings etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also some demand for a web front end so I might work on that next. (currently only android and ios)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had an initial boom of downloads in South Africa but lately most new downloads are in USA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a quantum simulator written in C++ from scratch. I’m not using any external library, so I had to implement everything from the lazy eval structure to the eigen solvers and so on. It’s still very a WIP, but here’s the repo: https://github.com/braketware/hilbert-qusim&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, I've read countless books. I started documenting one idea that shaped my thinking from each of these books. This idea may or may not be the core theme of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm getting back in to audio programming, starting off with Pd[1] and reading Miller Puckette's book[2]. I'm planning on writing some low-level C libraries afterwards, using The Audio Programming Book[3] as a guide&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building GhanaHousePlanner https://ghanahouseplanner.com/, a web platform to help people in Ghana/diaspora plan, estimate and manage house construction projects. It is free for individuals and only project management and using the floor planner ai agent needs subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current features include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Live material price list updated monthly (based on prices at local shops)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Conceptual 2D/3D floor plan generation following Ghana Building Standards (development in several phases using procedural floor plan generation)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Construction management dashboard to track project stages and conversations between project manager, mason, carpenter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Printable material cost breakdown&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TODO: A contact listing for local construction services&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has been a super fun experience so far - I'm using CPLDs instead of an FPGA which makes the logic a bit more era period. I have a working system now with the math coprocessor, SRAM, DRAM, and other device support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am just about ready to get the VGA card I designed produced so I can work on debugging the design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this is fundamentally a system that ss less powerful than my apple watch, it is just fun to work on. Going back to very first principles debugging, building tools, and of course getting to exercise an old logic analyzer!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've built a self-hosted reddit-like community platform in Go: https://baklab.app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users can create their own sub-communities, and within them, set up different categories and boards. Posts can be voted on, and board types can include regular posts, Q&amp;amp;A, or live chat. It's like a hybrid of Reddit and Discord but leans more towards a traditional web community. It also supports server-side rendering, making it SEO-friendly. This project is an extension of my previous Hacker News clone, dizkaz (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43885998).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a small rural ISP and web hosting service, as a way to learn about low-level networking stuff. I've got an ASN + IP space, and am working out the details with a colo, local fiber provider, and some upstreams. Right now I'm configuring the hardware itself (server, router, switch, etc) and learning all the bits and bobs (Proxmox, BGP, OPNsense, IXPs, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All I can say is good luck. We spun up a co-op isp to take advantage of fiber grants for rural areas about a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because of the grants, but it was a fucking nightmare getting off the ground even though we had nearly 90% of the population in three counties on board for the co-op. The red tape and regulations (in our state at least) made it clear that government runs for urban and suburban interests and actively undermines rural needs. I'm talking government in bed with large providers who had exclusive rights to run "high-speed" Internet to our towns and farms, even though they had never and were never planning on anything above dsl for most people and cable for the ones in town.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I was more charismatic (and wasn't 1000% sure there were pictures of me doing drugs when I was in college), I would consider a run for state office, because it's a shit show for small towns here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's the story of a) when we got sued by a large provider that I hope goes out of business and burns to the ground, and b) the last time I volunteered on a large project and why I will never take the lead on anything bigger than the Lion's Club pancake breakfast now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm funding this myself, and my current approach (hopefully!) avoids most of the red tape. I'm leasing fiber from a local ISP for the colo &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; my home connection, and once I have myself as a successful "customer" of my own ISP, I'll start doing the last mile build out, which is where I expect the red tape to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I haven't decided if I'll do fiber or wireless, and if I go wireless, I might be able to avoid pole agreements entirely by just working directly with my neighbors. The problem is that our area is pretty heavily wooded, so I'm not sure if I can place antennas high enough to cover a reasonable swatch of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; If I was more charismatic (and wasn't 1000% sure there were pictures of me doing drugs when I was in college), I would consider a run for state office, because it's a shit show for small towns here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loads of politicians have come back from worse! Don't let that hold you back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to learn Rust, but was too distracted to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I started working with Claude on building a postgres database replication application. I'm learning Postgres internals as well as how brittle database replication and subscription can really be. Although this is for Seren, you can replicate between any PG databases. https://github.com/serenorg/postgres-seren-replicator&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big learning: Claude Sonnet with Rust is massively productive. I'm impressed, but code bloat is a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve created a small command-line tool that generates a hash-based, human-readable list of git repositories and data folders. Its purpose is to capture the exact state of all projects and files in a single plain-text file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built it because I work across multiple machines and often worry about which projects are on which computer or whether I’ve left any files in unique locations. Now I can diff the summaries between devices to see what’s out of sync, which repositories have uncommitted changes, and which folders have been modified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I avoid using cloud sync services, and most of my files are already in git anyway. I find that having clear visibility is enough, I just need to know what to commit, push, pull, or sync manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would be glad if it proves useful to someone besides me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built this: https://github.com/dvcoolarun/web2pdf — a CLI tool for converting web pages to PDFs, recently open-sourced after adding several new features. (Might be useful!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not related to the thread, but if anyone is looking to hire a developer or knows of opportunities, I was recently let go and am actively searching. Any leads or feedback would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the street and satellite tiles are thanks to maps.black. The search uses Nominatim's sqlite3 mode. I was told that it's experimental only because it hasn't been tried in production yet, so I'm sort of testing it in the process. So far I'm only doing administrative boundaries and natural features, but so far so good! I'm going to slowly add a few more types of POIs, I just don't want the database file to get too big.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that Internet in a Box has an OSM offering already, but the data is five years old and the tech makes it harder to update. As of today, there are much easier options on the table, and we get cool stuff like 3d buildings. Also, the search was much more limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fully offline LLM coding agent plug-in for JetBrains IDEs. Use with Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf on an RTX 3090 or up. The source code is pretty short to make sure it can be audited, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is that a generic video message doesn't appeal to a fan of a video game streamer, instead what really would be cool would be watching them react to your best moment in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our software removes all friction from the journey, the fan doesn't even need to record their own gameplay, we have bots set up that can load up someone else's gameplay just from their username, record their highlight for them, upload it to our platform, then the streamer just needs to come in, watch a ~60 sec clip, give a genuine reaction, press 'submit' and its all done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a few markets I'm trying to find product market fit in: ~1-2 minute coaching sessions, sports commentator style commentary over your clip from influencers, hyped up reactions from your favorite streamer, a community-focused segment on a stream of watching a compilation of your fan's best moments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're ready to launch, just trying and struggling to find the first few people to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was tired of inspiration sites like Dribbble full of polished mockups that aren't practical. Or awwward like sites that don't represent the mundanity of most websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I spent a while building a tool that captures website design snippets. It's now a collection of 4,363 designs from 544 different domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For every design, it extracts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exact fonts used on the page (so far 561 unique font families I've found)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 2 years back I began working on a very simple markdown compiler, it was “immediate” in that it would consume markdown and immediately spit html. That project turned into a whole static site generator called Kevlar — https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entirely built from scratch in C without any dependencies. Now I wrote this code when I was 16, so many memory leaks and generally issues that I wanted to rectify and begin using third project for my own blog (currently old version is used — https://aadvikpandey.com)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kevlar v3 (https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar/tree/kevlar-v3) here is all that it includes; more spec compliant markdown AST-based parsing; A better .ini config parser (right now it’s literally strtok on ‘=‘ and generally very hacky) as well as name spacing; more powerful templating tags like IF, FOR with lisp-like configuration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course staying true to the spirit of “from scratch” :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly I did scope creeped a little since I mainly wanted to fix a memory leaks issue in the markdown compiler lol; anyway I will share it once it gets completed on hacker news :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Entirely built from scratch in C without any dependencies. Now I wrote this code when I was 16&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very few young folk are learning C; I think it is commendable that you are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You code doesn't seem very strongly structured (to be expected, TBH) but much better than any learner would see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What resources did you use to start learning C? I ask because it looks to me that those resources covered "how to program in C" but not so much design and structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's two links (my own blog) to get you started on one or two common C patterns designed to minimise bugs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey, thanks for your comment :) I had a look at your blog, it's looks really useful and high quality! I will go through it with vim open on the side and a nice coffee&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah and I'd agree with your point. One BIG critique I have for my own 2-year-past code was that I did not know how to do dynamic heap allocation very well, hence you may have seen everything is stack allocated lol&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I had read "clean code" by uncle bob at the time, so I was trying to emulate clean code I saw in the book. Needless to say, pretty good example of the nuance needed when writing clean code haha)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So with the V3 release, I am re-writing the markdown compiler for instance, and being a bit more mindful of the structure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think once I am done I will create a separate "Show HN" post to get valuable feedback (like this one!) from smarter folks than me. Once again, thanks for the fantastic blog :) will be sure to go through it&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a binary that will instrument every Java service running on Linux host machine with OpenTelemetry Java Agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kinda like this (https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-injector) but with support of having multiple service name for different services. This includes tomcat, normal systemd services and also services running inside docker containers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDIT: I am popping my cherry with this comment on HN. Been a lurker since past 2-3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week we're building out the UX around formatting and this month we're building a more robust set of integration tests and integrating with a large industry platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently have gotten into the "drag and drop" forms of programming like Node-RED and n8n.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, anyone here who has read my posts knows I know how to write code, but having a bunch of built in connectors that are agnostic to each other with the Oauth and the like being somewhat plug and play allows me to iterate on some ideas a lot quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I installed an n8n instance on my server, and have become kind of addicted to making different Discord bots, and I'm having more fun with this than I thought I would. 95% of the stuff on there is basically drag and drop, and when I need more elaborate logic then I can easily drop into JavaScript. I am looking into writing new nodes for different services, and I keep having new ideas for different stuff I want to build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we are working on Aye Chat: an AI development tool for the terminal. It will make changes directly and let you revert changes through our snapshot feature, all while you can stay in the terminal to execute your favorite (terminal) editor and what not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If allows the use of different models, no need to sign-up at the moment and at no cost. We released our beta just last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were getting annoyed by all the additional confirmation questions by other AI assistants, and having to switch between consoles to use a editor and/or revert changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recreated a little tool to simultaneously mount all the commits in a git repository as directories at the same time (but re-use the same inodes for the same content).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original was in Python and actually had a decent excuse for existing for a very specific problem at work a few years ago. The new version is in Rust and exists just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was also a small experiment in coding with OpenAI's codex. I wrote the Python original by hand---like a caveman. Codex was mostly ok at the actual code, especially once I told it to make `cargo clippy` happy, but it needed lots of help with the design. It kept insisting on extra complications and state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But perhaps I'm a bit unfair here, because I only figured out the nice and simple design after reflecting on the connection between Linux's fuse and git's design for a while when writing the original. So it's only fair that the computer would also need some help to see how to match them up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had a bunch of quants who were writing Python and Matlab code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously they just saved it in a (Windows) Shared Folder and it automatically showed up in the test cluster. No version control, no nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test cluster had actually grown to a few thousand machines or so. Running Shared Folders over that was crazy, and no version control was crazy, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, they expected to be able to write output files next to the source files, and expected them to show up to be used by the other machines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were trying to help them migrate to something saner. We could convince them to not intermix source code and output files, but as part of that bargain otherwise they wanted everything to look as similar as possible to before, but still support some git-goodness we have promised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, they had checked in some rather large files into their repository. Like Gigabytes, and lots of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As before, we wanted to support running multiple processes at the same time, but this time on different versions. As a joke I suggested to 'just mount' the git repository directly (that we constantly pull to every computer in the cluster), but my boss thought it was a grand idea, thus the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An additional nicety: under the hood 'git stash' consists of two phases, the first phase make something like a commit from what you have lying around in your repo, the second phase cleans up what you have lying around. If you use libgit2 (or a similar library) you can use just the first phase to get something like a commit, and send that to the server to execute, while changing nothing on the quant's machine, and not forcing them to explicitly make a commit nor polluting their git history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One saner alternative would have been to just make a checkout for each run. But naively that would have taken more storage space than we had, thanks to those big files. Alternatively, we could have done some sharing for running the same version. But that would have involved some reference counting etc and cleaning up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my suggestion was to 'just let the kernel caches handle it'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, the prototype was useful to get the quants to get along with what we did. And luckily for our sanity, we could soon convince the quants to store those large files somewhere else, and not in the repository along with the code. That restored our sanity, and we could move to a more conventional scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The working life of the tool was blessedly short, but it played an important role in getting the quants to move along in their journey to using version control. Though even though on paper it might have looked like an abortive and wasted effort, in terms of business value it was very successful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love the quants. They are very technical and very smart and effectively write software all day every day, but they don't see themselves as software engineers, and they aren't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recreated it just for fun, because I like the connection between git and how filesystems work. You can really tell that Linus Torvalds, the original author and designer of git is an operating systems guy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am right now building a proactive coach on top of my AI work capture app. Concept is very simple: It takes a screenshot every few minutes and analyzes what you're working on. From there it identifies task blocks, and checks if it should start a chat based on your intentions (eg to tell you to move out of your rabbit hole, take a break, help with a task, ...)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://donethat.ai Passively processing screenshots is obviously pretty sensitive, it has an option to bring your own (local or remote) LLM, otherwise I process with gemini and never store any data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's in beta right now so if you want to try it you have to enable "proactive chat" in settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on https://regularly.co/ - A website made for inquisitive minds to get their daily puzzle fix. Still very much a WIP (mainly working on tuning the difficulty of puzzles to make it enjoyable for most). That being said I really do enjoy the unique combination of puzzles when I do them each day. I’m looking for feedback so if you do take a look please do let me know your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incredible. Thank you for sharing this, I love puzzles and like setting aside some time in the morning to do them. This will enhance that habit so much! A whole slew of daily puzzles, I'll let you know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah this rule is mentioned under “Kings cannot attack each other” (in the chess sense, two Kings cannot be diagonal from one another). I’ve updated the rule to make this a little clearer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe it wasn't there when you played, but rule 6 states kings cannot attack each other; chess kings can move one square in any direction. Without this rule the puzzle isn't solvable by logic, only trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted a typing application that’s both more than typing random words and is data-focused so I built this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more you type, the more the analytics system learns about your typing patterns and generates natural text to target those weakpoints (SmartPractice mode).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of variety as well; you can practice typing code in any programming language, or type text of various topics, use custom text, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still very focused on making light healthier. 3 new products:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bedtime Bulb v2[0]: A massive improvement over our original Bedtime Bulb, a light bulb meant for use in the evening to reduce blue light. The headline feature is the re-introduction of infrared, which was removed from lighting to make it more efficient, but emerging research suggest it's beneficial for health. After a long wait, this is shipping in 2 weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atmos Bedside Lamp[1]: A fully automated circadian lamp that automatically shifts in color and brightness throughout the day, helping you prepare for sleep and wake up more naturally. Working on some machine learning features that mimic the functionality of the Nest Learning Thermostat, but for lighting. The first units are shipping by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Circadian Mode for Philips Hue[2]: A web app that gives your Philips Hue lights circadian powers, so that they gradually shift from bright light during the day to dim, low-blue light at night. It's way more powerful and easier to use than first- and third-party options from Hue, Apple, and Home Assistant. Just launched this week; looking for beta testers to give feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on https://easymiet.eu/ It is specific to the German rental market. Basically if you want to rent an appartment in Germany most landlords require you to fill out a non-standardized self-disclosure form. That can be annoying to the landlord because especially in larger cities you might have a couple of hundret applicants and it is also annoying to the possible renter since they have to fill out the same information for every apartment they apply for. This is where easymiet comes in. As a landlord you can generate a viewing, shared it through QR or a link. Interested renters can apply using their profile. It also has a application approve and dismissal workflow automatically sending emails to the applicant. My plan was to monitize it selling applicants the ability to add more info to their profile like a picture or relevant documents. However so far I haven't been able to generate much interest. The tech stack is Next JS with BetterAuth, Drizzle and Postgres. It is hosted on a Hetzner VPS using Kamal ( wrote a blogpost about that if you are interested: https://markow.dev/blog/complex-next-js-app-kamal )&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quick feedback: looks way too empty for me to look real. Could also just be a scam. Also: why would I as an applicant add more data for money? The landlord has the benefit, they should pay for that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Wir sind nicht bereit oder verpflichtet, an Streitbeilegungsverfahren vor einer Verbraucherschlichtungsstelle teilzunehmen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, the thread is called "What are you working on", so it's by definition work-in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Also: why would I as an applicant add more data for money? The landlord has the benefit, they should pay for that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many hot rental markets (My experience mostly with Berlin), you are mostly not in a position to say "the landlord should pay that" and everyone is desperate to supply the best, most complete and most convincing documents even if it feels bad to fork over that much personal data to a random stranger on a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Im a simple man Made a small web app for my local game store for playing magic the gathering where you can analyze your commander decks: https://brackcheck.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a tool to generate a PDF for each row of a Google sheet. For example, you can generate 100 personalized PDFs (like certificates) for 100 students listed in a Google Sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you sign up and connect your Google sheet, it generates a template (using AI) based on your data, which you can edit in a Notion-like editor. You can then generate PDFs for your entire sheet or a for a range of rows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An open-source, local database which collects all your personal data, hooks it to an LLM (BYO), and gives you an assistant that can answer any question about your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also allows you to vibe-code (or just code) small apps on top of your data (e.g., your custom dashboard for your expenses).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Made some updates to this open-source library I wrote to render audio waveforms using the GPU on the browser (WebGPU).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example on the site. Works without enabling flags on Chromium browsers. There's an example to scrub and zoom in real time on some audio. Feedback welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been wanting to learn more embedded type projects, and I've been snacking too often so I've been building a box that will only open on the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got all the components, tested it on a breadboard, learned to solder and now I'm working on the 3d Print to enclose everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually just did a test run to see if my current 3d design would fit my PICO board, and it fit, but not that secure yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Im a developer but never worked this close to metal, so I've been so happy with how it's been going so far, making me real proud of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on ScratchTJ, a DIY digital turntable built with a Raspberry Pi and Arduino Nano. It’s based on the open-source SC1000 code, but with some hardware changes and tweaks to make it easier to build and customize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It runs on a Raspberry Pi 2 with an AudioInjector sound card, a small LCD screen, a rotary encoder, and even an old hard-drive platter as the “deck.” The goal is to make a simple, open, and affordable way to experiment with scratching and mixing — no fancy gear required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s still in progress, but it works pretty well and has been a fun way to explore DIY DJ tech and embedded audio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a K8S hosting solution that just gives the user a simple Kubernetes cluster. I (or we) handle the compute, (networked) storage and ingress hosting for you, and the cluster provision time should be within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You just need to pay for a fixed monthly upfront cost rather than PAYG, giving small developers a good save of their money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, this is similar to self hosting with K0S/K3S/OpenShift, except you don't have to own servers to begin with, in other words, it is a little similar to serverless K8S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, all you those you can actually do with a VPS today, heck why do I have to do it if EKS/GKE/LKE/OKE/DOKS exists? That's because it takes a lot of time to properly setup VPC/EBS/S3/EC2, you need to pay an insane amount of premium and overheads to those while an ordinary user just don't want to hassle too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to undercut the big clouds by saving people's money and time. I have had enough of seeing a ludicrous EKS billing. I just want K8S to be the control panel of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This resonates with my experience as a small startup dev. I wouldn't mind bringing my own servers for running my apps but for k8s I need at least 3 control nodes in each cluster and I need multiple clusters to cover different parts of the world. All those control planes are idling most of the time but cost money and effort to keep them alive. I'm sure those could be shared among dozens of users. Is this something you are going to support? Or I'll also have to rent the worker nodes from you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You rent the compute, storage and network from the worker clusters at a fixed monthly price as one budget package, just like how you buy VPSes back in the days (think EC2 Lightsail or Linode, except now you just have a K8S context). You can choose multiple geolocations, but I'm still looking for a successful lab simulation first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I'm hosting my own test cluster under my bed so I can't show it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't have to manage CNI, CSI, Linux kernel, etcd. You just need Kubernetes app development knowledge and that's basically it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I'm still thinking about how to get live migration and failover working, so it is going to take a painful while...Kata Container doesn't support it out of the box but Cloud Hypervisor does&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No link yet as I'm still just a solo dev, the (hobbish?) project is crawling very slowly, but I have the general architecture in mind. I need to get the frontend first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to submit it as a startup project last year but the feedback isn't great, I want to have something polished first before making it public&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently it works as standalone player. Addition of MPD client mode opens possibility to play music on a separate device while keeping the UX of the music player that I like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on Rad [0], a programming language built specifically for CLI scripts, so you don't need to write Bash, and it offers CLI-tailored features which make it a better choice than Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lately I've mainly been working on stability and bug fixes. I've released some big features the past few months so I'm doing a big push on polish, before I again tackle some larger features that I'd like to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If CLI scripts is something you're interested in at all, give it a go! We have docs and a guide [1] for getting started, feedback very welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AgentOS is a lisp-machine inspired runtime where agents can safely propose, simulate, and apply changes to their own code, policies, and workflows, all under governance, with full audit trails. Every external action produces a signed receipt. Every state change is replayable from an event log.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Habitat. It's a free and open source, self-hosted platform for communities to discover and discuss their local area. The plan is for it to be federated. I've recently solved an issue with cron jobs that was driving me mad for ages. I feel that I'm pretty much nearing a first tagged release, but I feel that I need to work on branding and messaging a bit before I do. I can't tell if I'm procrastinating that final push to something that makes it more official or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a free replacement to the NY Times daily mini crossword after they started charging for it and I didn't want to pay. https://www.jepeto-mini.com/ (DNS may still be propagating).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fun project with lots of challenges finding word lists, refining them, using AI for clue generation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I played it, and it was fun. Some feedback (I'm on mobile) is that it needs UX improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first I wasn't sure what I had to do, it simply throws you into the game, and it's easy to get confused with the numbers around it, because usually if there are numbers, there is going to be somewhere (usually at the bottom) the numbers and the clue for each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took me a bit to find how to get the clues from the vertical words (double tapping).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The onscreen keyboard isn't very responsive in the sense that I had to tap several times the backspace to delete a letter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The WebGL game was build with my 2D game engine "Impact", which I previously ported to C[1]. The game has a 3d view, but logic still mostly works in 2 dimensions on a flat ground. The N64 version "just" needed a different rendering and sound backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are building https://desplega.ai which is a QA agent that help teams ship fast without compromising quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We focus on making it as fast as possible, integrated into CI, MCP for local dev, and support both an autonomous (we call it discovery) and guided test creation approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that in the era of vibe-coding, quality is key, as we are lazer focus on building a solution that scales with your product, and removes the burden of QA from your team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically, we built an in-house engine that is in charge of generating the tests, that speeds up and gets better the more you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wondering what people are using AI for and if there are public/shareable/or leaked chats out there from all platforms either chatgpt, gemini, grok, claude, perplexity etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I am building this https://www.leaklake.com , where you can search your name, brand, and basically any keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also set an Alert because crawling and starping is running 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's intended to be a sort of social network focused on IRL groups/communities and finding others with the same interests in the same area, and just building local communities in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's currently still a part-time venture, but I'm planning a launch on HN soon to get input/gauge interest in the latest iteration. FWIW, I posted the initial version on HN just over a year ago and got a ton of amazing feedback, much of which I've incorporated over the last year - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40717398&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a recipe app but better, and way more technically capable than anything out there. The goal is to make the best recipe app ever made. With bulletproof easy to follow recipes and smart features to make cooking simple. Everyone deserves good food at home, but good food is complicated and time consuming. An experienced cook can make good food quickly, cheaply and make it look easy. The idea is that Kastanj will have the knowledge you don’t so you can cook like a pro without having to spend years learning everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backstory: I have a note where I write down practical problems I experience in life. I noticed over time that the amount of notes related to food and cooking was growing faster than anything else. I then began searching for a solution. I tried over 50 recipe apps, always the premium version if possible. There are some good apps out there but even the best ones only solved something like 50% of my issues. After enough frustration and search I just decided to start working on my own app. That was 4 years ago... It turns out that solving some of these problems where technically complicated to do, so now I understand why no other app could solve my problems. None the less, after 4 years of work, starting over from scratch 5 times, I have now landed on a solution that technically solves all my problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going forward: Now I am working on filling the app with data and make it easy to use for normal humans. I am on purpose limiting myself to only perfecting the core functionality of what a recipe should be. I intend to launch sometime in 2026. The UI will be small and limited at first, but it is perfect for my needs. Therefore I hope it will also be perfect for someone else. Over time I will enable more advanced functionality and build it out based on user feedback. I know the backend can support 100% of my needs, but I don’t want to make it bloated. Therefore the UI is on purpose focused on only the most important things and then we will build it out with time, together with the recipe creators and end users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've spent several years since Covid times solo-developing an ad-free website with 50+ solitaire/puzzle games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've gathered some feedback from users from HN already and now trying to fix things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm looking to genuinely improve the experience so would be incredibly grateful for any feedback. I'm also wondering what it lacks – any particular games or modes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a phone app that streamlines household management for unmotivated losers (like me) so that they stop wasting money (wasted food) and time (procrastination)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on an app that helps me (and other people) do household management on autopilot. It helps me manage things, food, expiration dates, shopping, chores, and I get notified periodically to review my lists. I waste way less food and I actually do my chores instead of procrastinating. https://okthings.app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. How i tried to solve it: you have a shopping list where you can add things on the fly. These things will need to be categorized (food, household supplies etc) at a later date, which is when the review is due for the "Uncategorized" category.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally, i tend to buy the same things, so the "big" data entry job happens only once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on fighting IBM's patent trolls. IBM slapped the words 'AI Interpretability' on Gauss' 200 year old continued fractions and was awarded a patent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now they can charge rent if they encounter a continued fraction library in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authors simply implement a continued fraction library in Pytorch and call the backward() function on the resulting computation graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is, they chain linear neural network layers and use the reciprocal (not RELU ) as the primary non-linearity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authors reinvent the wheel countless times:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. They rename continued fractions and call them ‘ladders’. 2. They label basic division ‘The 1/z nonlinearity’. 3. Ultimately, they take the well-defined concept of Generalized Continued Fractions and call them CoFrNets and got a patent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IBM's lawyers can strip out all the buzzword garbage if they feel litigious and sue anyone whose written a continued fraction library. Because, that's what the patent (without all the buzzwords) protects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You sent me down a rabbit hole. In trying to track it down for myself I read a couple of others that I thought might be it, and was stunned by how obtuse these patents are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What sort of leverage does this stuff provide? You mentioned "charge rent". What does that look like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don't even know where to begin. It's insane IBM owns the patent to continued fractions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you wrote a continued fraction class in Pytorch and called backwards (or even differentiated the power series) then you're infringing on their copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building better dev tools for firmware and PCB developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we have GitHub Action workflows that allow you to push builds to the connected EmbedHub project. Your EmbedHub project has fine grained release management - so for example only the git tagged releases will be shared with the customer, but the testing/QA team will get access to builds from regular commits on branches as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am also building a physical device (called HAL) similar to the now discontinued EtcherPro[1] - which will connect to your EmbedHub account and have access to your releases. This will let you offload tasks like long term testing, mass flashing and provisioning of devices, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working a Garmin watch app to query all the rich data on the watch (health, physical, environmental, location sensors) from the watch + general AI assistant. Privacy focused using your own keys and Gemini. API calls direct from watch - no backend. https://untether.watch&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a platform to run a friendly competition in “who builds the best reasoning AI Agent”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each participating team (got 300 signups so far) will get a set of text tasks and a set of simulated APIs to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance the task (a typical chatbot task) could say something like: “Schedule 30m knowledge exchange next week between the most experienced Python expert in the company and 3-5 people that are most interested in learning it “&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agent will have to solve through this by using a set of simulated APIs and playing a bit of calendar Tetris (in this case - Calendar API, Email API, SkillWill API).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since API instances are simulated and isolated (per team per task), it becomes fairly easy to automatically check correctness of each solution and rank different agents in a global leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code of agents stays external, but participants fill and submit brief questionnaires about their architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By benchmarking different agentic implementations on the same tasks - we get to see patterns in performance, accuracy and costs of various architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codebase of the platform is written mostly in golang (to support thousands of concurrent simulations). I’m using coding agents (Claude Code and Codex) for exploration and easy coding tasks, but the core has still to be handcrafted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a sillier project lately. Green teeth!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lumina has made a probiotic strain that is able to, theoretically, prevent cavities. I don't care that much about, but I do think it is a neat strain that can likely colonize your mouth. I'm genetically engineering it to express sfGFP, which would theoretically make my teeth fluorescent green under black light. Would be fun at raves! Also, if I make out with anyone, you could theoretically see changes in microbiome composition just from green-ness. I do wonder how much microbiomes are shared while kissing: this would be an example of a way to directly measure that, instead of just measuring on proxy like much microbiome research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to visualize all my walks and runs on a single map. I built a native iOS app that fetches Apple Health and Strava workouts and visualizes them. Privacy was a major factor in building the app, so all the data stays on the device. Next version will have a time-lapse video option. Any feedback welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a little project to make Spotify recommendations better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You get to choose the genres you're interested in, and it creates playlists from the music in your library. They get updated every day - think a better version of the Daily Mixes. You can add some advanced filters as well, if you really want to customise what music you'll get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does this deal with, what I call the "Armin Problem?" I typically listen to EDM and there is an extremely popular DJ named Armin van Buuren, and he has other aliases (which exacerbates the issue). His sets end up directly on music platforms, and he pulls in a ton of EDM sub-genres (which makes him a great DJ!). Any recommendation algorithm that visits one of his aliases is doomed to be connected to every other sub-genre, so I might be listening to progressive trance, and be in the mood for that, and end up on deep house (as an extreme example). Within EDM, genres can be as different as blues is to metal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not directly, no. I still rely on the data that Spotify gives me that relates to artists' information; and it's not great a lot of the time. E.g. there are obvious cases where artists belong to genres that they should not belong to. I do have some ideas for improvement, but they are still WIP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What it allows you to do, though, is create your playlists with extended filters. E.g. you can select genres, and at the same time exclude genres - that helps with the "cross-contamination". You also get a view of all the artists that match your selections and you can add exclusions for them as well. It is a bit of manual work, but it works pretty good for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been building a Decentralized Database built on top of syncing CRDTs, and recently got it to a point I can demo. It's definitely in a "proof-of-concept" stage though, known security holes and all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been focused on building out the featureset and keeping everything unstable instead of trying to finalize each piece as I build it. It's the opposite of how I normally build things but I think it's been working pretty well for this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building https://arabicworksheet.com, AI powered Saudi Arabic learning app for expats who work and live in saudi arabia. 100% FREE. It generates printable worksheets based on your level, dialect and topics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am also building an app for kids to make their arabic learning fun, rewarding and enjoyable. Do try and share your feedback. TIA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time I talk acquaintances, friends and family members about finances I'm always shocked at how little people know about basic things like tax brackets, 401Ks, IRAs, ETFs, compounding interest, debt management and etc. So I decided to write a financial literacy/education book with a bit of humor and easily comprehensible language to distill some of these topics. I'm about 1 month into it and try to write a chapter a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently building a suite of media inspection and encoding tools for video engineers: https://video-commander.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still very much a work in progress, but expecting to release a first version by end of year. Built on Tauri, in case anyone is curious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've created various open-source and commercial tools in the multimedia space over the last 10+ years and wanted to put it all together into something more premium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on getting back into a fitness routine. I got into this habit of hacking on side projects in my very little spare time but I have realized taking care of my body will pay off far more than any project&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the best - the best project to work on! I recently tested a walking pad with a standing desk at my friends place - I was surprisingly productive being able to walk while using the computer. Will be investing in a standing desk and walking pad for my home office.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have found for myself that there is a lack of vocabulary learning apps that have good search functions. When I make a search function, I want it to be able to find all subsets of words, that I could think of. Instead what many search functions only allow you to do is, to first find one set of words, and then in a new separate search find another set of words. Currently working on that search function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also what I find annoying in spaced repetition learning apps I have seen so far is, that they will ask you very simple words over and over again, just because you didn't see them in a while. But I really don't need to learn those words over and over again, because I just know them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another annoying thing is, that in some apps you cannot see your learning progress. How many percent you already learned. Or that you cannot specify how difficult a word is to learn. Or how relevant it is. All this metadata, that could be good for learners to be able to search through, when searching for the subset of words they want to learn next. Oh, and of course tags ... With tags one can add all kinds of attributes to words. Maybe I am only looking for nouns or verbs. Maybe I am only interested in words that have something to do with family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is still a lot to do, but it is taking shape nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is written in Python and tkinter. It is very simple to use in most aspects, and I really don't care much about the looks. I actually find them refreshingly simple and functional. Not this "everything flat" kind of epidemic in UI, and widgets still give feedback when using them. Not web based with the typical nodejs or npm overhead and tens or hundreds of dependencies. Nope, keeping it very minimal so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also have another idea, that might give it a modern touch, but that might also introduce overhead and probably should be an optional setup or feature: Give users tools to let LLMs generate example usages of words, if they want to do so. Of course that would have to be a local LLM I don't want to get into users having to sign up somewhere and get API keys and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am also not planning to make a mobile app. Maybe later I can create an API, so that one could build a web frontend, if one chooses to do so. But first I want to build this app and the functionality behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;hosting a month-long residency for indie hackers in Da Nang, Vietnam!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we invited 10 of the best indie devs from around the world to live &amp;amp; build alongside us for a month at a beautiful villa. for free. (we have sponsors like OpenRouter, Cognition, n8n, and CodeRabbit!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Music player that can organize album collections from different services like Spotify, Apple Music and Bandcamp, Discogs, and show detailed and high quality information that can be searched and filtered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm resurrecting peer-to-peer Matrix (https://arewep2pyet.com) thanks to the Dutch government, who started funding it in October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main question is which P2P overlay network to use, if any: the prior incarnation used Pinecone (a variant of Yggdrasil), whereas this time we're pondering keeping it simpler and more scalable and using Matrix itself as the backbone to connect together smallish local P2P meshes - so by default you try to route via Matrix, but failing that you look on your LAN or BLE to see if you can talk directly to whoever you're addressing. Time will tell if this works :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are open to suggestions :) And the very first generation of P2P Matrix was indeed built on libp2p (and Protocol Labs led Element's Series B). However, the thought experiment here is whether we can get away without a full global P2P overlay at all in the interests of keeping it simple &amp;amp; stupid. We might well end up back at libp2p tho!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For my work I've developed a web-based Monte Carlo simulator with a visual, node-based editor for building supply chain models. Last week, I started making it available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can have a look at https://simcarlo.com. The tool allows you to see the full spectrum of potential outcomes instead of just a single guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been a few astrology apps, but all require you to connect with an astrologer or a pandit. This market has been in past and today, a market of exploitation for the innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I built this app to let people read their birth chart with detailed analysis, without any such thugs. There are a few very talented experts, but they are either very expensive or difficult to find. So, it came out of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would love your feedback on trying it out and letting me know your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was a YC founder in 2006 and now work as a data scientist full-time, but on the side I also do Christian apologetics, helping fellow engineers/scientists/mathematicians seek answers to life's deepest questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m currently creating a simple community where people can honestly share their emotions and empathize with others’ feelings (without comments). It’s a web community where users can receive a comforting message from AI based on emotion analysis of their text, emojis, and chosen colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas or comments for improvement, feel free to reply anytime! (For reference, this service is designed for Korean users — I’m Korean myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've created an AI-assisted writing platform, that doesn't generate text, but instead lends focus to human creativity, and have AI assist you instead of trying to replace you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You create a writing style via existing text examples, blog posts or URLs, and Arcitext extracts a "writing fingerprint" which it benchmarks new text against.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a solid Markdown Editor with tools such as Tone Fit, Rewrite suggestions and Fact Check, which helps you when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kind of like having a writing coach and content strategist on speed dial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s so much nuance in HN threads that often gets missed elsewhere, so I decided to put start this newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially started as an experiment for 10 issues to see ig it gets traction, 6 issues in it’s at 68 subs and probably will continue for unlimited time period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most (meta)science discussion is either fragmented on Twitter/Bsky, or a bit too formal. I thought a centralised place for deeper, casual discussions might be helpful, so I'm testing that theory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launched a few days ago, so it might have some rough edges. I'm considering making it user-invite-only soon, but for now it's fully open for signup. I'll also move it to its own domain once I think of a better name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frustrated by the complexity and high overhead of most monitoring tools, I wrote Simon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a single binary, dependency-free monitor in Rust that does it all: metrics, Docker, alerts, and file browsing. While maintaining a minimal footprint for embedded systems and other constrained hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today I'm hacking on automate-terminal, a command line program and Python library that abstracts the various terminal emulator automations (iTerm2, WezTerm, Kitty, tmux) into a single API. Mostly made for use by other tools. https://github.com/irskep/automate-terminal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on some tailored to my needs tax reporting software. I submit claims to my workplace in batches under a number of different categories. Using this as an excuse to get better at some bits of SQL, leaning Textual as well, which I'm hoping to use in other things. Other than that I'm cooking a few IRC bots that I swap to when the other code becomes a bit too boring&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many language-learning apps, but almost none that focus on improving conversational Hindi for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Made this web app for my nephew, based in Singapore, after watching him struggle to find anyone to practice Hindi with outside of family calls (since most of his friends are Chinese). The idea is to have a 24x7 partner to speak with Hindi and make it fun. This can complement the formal Hindi classes that most kids of Indian diaspora parents take.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenRun runs as a web server, which does GitOps driven app deployments. You can currently deploy apps on a standalone machine, on top of Docker/Podman. Working on adding support for deploying on top of Kubernetes. On Kubernetes, OpenRun will replace your build jobs (Jenkins/Actions etc), CD (ArgoCD etc) and IDP (Backstage etc). The same declarative config which works on a standalone machine will work on Kubernetes, with no YAML to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a custom assembler built on top of the LLVM assembler (llvm-mc) that emits instrumentation code to catch ABI violations at runtime. Stuff like clobbering nonvolatile registers, misaligning the stack pointer, misusing the redzone, assuming volatile registers don't change across a function call, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hoping to finish up basic x86_64 support within the next few days. I can now reliably assemble and run unoptimized gcc output without hitting false positives, but I still have to iron out some false positives triggered by OpenSSL's handwritten assembly routines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TODO items for the near future include porting the runtime support library into a kernel module so I can instrument Linux, and beginning ports other architectures (ideally something semi-obscure like POWER or RISC-V). I also need to figure out how to support dynamic linking, because the tool currently needs static linking to access its thread-local variables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problem: I collect a lot of music I come across in playlists on Youtube/YT music/Bandcamp, but tracks often disappear for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on: Offline Youtube playlist download manager. It uses YT-DLP to get all my music and then enriches artist/track metadata using MusicBrainz, AcoustID, Discogs, LastFM, Spotify. Runs as an offline webapp so I can browse and play music locally. Might play around with recommendations for fun later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy to publish the repo if anyone else would find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a little game for my daughter to help her learn the movement of chess pieces. https://www.minichessgames.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's currently just a "maze" type game where you have to get to a goal square in the minimum number of moves (there are rocks placed on the board to act as obstacles)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm in the process of making some very simple games like battling knights where they leave poo and you try to trap your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun making it even if it's just the two of us who'll enjoy it :). Partly I wanted her to learn that you can create for the internet not just consume...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past 2 months I have been doing a heavy deep dive into image generation and image generation editing capabilities. This then had me discover that you can generate storyboards for short stories, and automate the creation of these as videos with video generation models. This is a topic that interests me heavily, and as such I am now building my own workflows around that. I am documenting the entire journey here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not something I am looking to commercialize, but I actually did drop out of film school (with semesters in creative storytelling) to pursue software 15 years ago. And I feel like this will open up a whole new way of visual storytelling as well as personal and product branding. I have gotten quite some emails about it, from interesting people in different industries, as some more strongly worded (not so nice) emails from someone in the VFX industry since I started. Its by far one of the most interesting tangents I have ever went on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My friends and I have been hacking on http://dateit.com for a while. It's an event planning app (works best on iOS and android, but there is a web app) with lots of fun features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started working on this all the way back during the Covid lockdown when we wanted to capture that "facebook events" experience without the facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's grown into something much more than our original idea. Most of the features are free and we have a fair pricing model that doesn't nickel-and-dime you like many of the competing apps do. Would love your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a coding agent, named VT Code [0]. VT Code is a Rust-based terminal coding agent with semantic code intelligence via Tree-sitter. Supports multiple LLM providers with automatic failover and efficient context management. Support OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, xAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Z.AI, Moonshot AI, MiniMax, and Ollama (local &amp;amp; Cloud). Agent Client Protocol and Model Context Protocol fully support. VT Code supports a rich set of configuration options, with preferences stored in vtcode.toml. Has both Visual Studio Code and Open VSX extensions so that you can install in VS Code or Cursor, Windsurf, Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been building it for several months now and enjoy the learning process, I also wrote a blog post and learnt a ton about terminal, ANSI processing. The learning has been immense for me, I now have working knowledge of ANSI escape codes, grapheme clusters, terminal emulators, Unicode normalization, VT protocols, PTY sessions, and filesystem operations, all the low-level details I would have never think about until I were implementing them. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A kernel extension-less sshfs for macOS. I tried using FSKit and got halfway before I felt too constrained by the extension security model (must be app sandboxed, must be approved by the user in system settings). Now it’s just a standalone command line binary that doesn’t require any special permissions since it proxies NFS to SFTP. Everything “just works” and performance is reasonable&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you play DnD, I would love feedback! Feel free to leave it as GitHub issues or discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don't play DnD, you might still find the repo interesting. It's hono on bun, I render jsx server side and client side is all htmx. I use vercel's ai toolkit for the LLM interactions, which are super fun and work really well. I think this is a great use for AI actually. I've structured the code so the same services can be called either by the user via forms and routes, or via LLM tool use, so for every action in the code you can do it via either LLM or "manually".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LLM usage is fun and interesting. What model are you using, and how much customization are you doing to integrate with the app and maintain character?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suggest adding an export function to make the characters more portable. Maybe export to PDF as well as JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an AST-walking interpreter for my personal LISP dialect written in C. Once it's ready, I would use it to implement a low-level, statically typed language (Schnell) as a Langsam library. The goal is to gain the ability to JIT-compile Schnell code (sexps of a statically typed language) from Langsam. Once this works, I would rewrite Langsam in Schnell so that it becomes a fast bytecode interpreter. With the faster Langsam (and the Schnell built into it) I could build a little OS called "Oben". The OS would first run on top of Linux, then I would attempt to bootstrap the entire stack on bare-metal. I already have a Forth dialect implemented in assembly language (Grund/Boden). The idea is to implement Langsam in Grund and then bootstrap the entire Grund -&amp;gt; Langsam -&amp;gt; Schnell -&amp;gt; Oben chain on something like the qemu q35, later on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and maybe even my own hardware (ie. an FPGA board like what Wirth et al. created for Project Oberon).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a TUI MIDI tracker written in Go. Not too user-friendly: one has to enter raw MIDI messages in hex into the tracks. Can be connected to synths like Fluidsynth or Surge XT via JACK MIDI. Unfortunately it takes a lot of CPU time, probably due to the use of BubbleTea (and no time spent on optimization).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginnings of a programmable, non-realtime audio sample generator/manipulator written in Go with an OpenGL GUI. I was thinking about how people in the old times cut up the magnetic tape which contained the sound bites and rearranged them to build something new. What if I'd implement a data type called "tape" which is basically a piece of sound and then provide operators in a Forth-like language to create and manipulate such tapes. Each tape could be a sound and then these could be stitched together to form songs. Who knows maybe an entire song could be represented as a hierarchy of these tapes. Each sound or song section could be its own file (*.tape), these could be loaded from each other, maybe even caching the WAV generated from the code of a tape to speed things up when there is a huge hierarchy of tapes in a project. Lots of interesting ideas are brewing in this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been tinkering on a little price drop alert scraper written in Python. It's run as a cron job, and every day it checks the prices of a list of urls (my clothing staples from various outdoor retailers, mostly) and sends me an email with any products that have gone on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been running it for over a year, but now I have fixed it up and made a little landing page to see if there's interest for a stupid-simple price watch service like this (no need to install an extension or create an account):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a performance review (PR) management platform that doesn't require a steep cost and deep integration into HRMS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a need I have for myself and the teams I run – It offers direct PR's, 360º reviews, recording of wins and lessons (something often overlooked), and aims to be a platform for team and individualised growth, that is accessible to small and large businesses alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Civil 3D plugin (Genabler) that will include all the network catalogs and collate the Civil 3D styles for civil engineers to use. There are some out-of-the-box catalogs and styles shipped with the default installation, but they are quite limited and fairly well hidden—which is not surprising, given that Civil 3D is a huge beast. As a result, they are not commonly used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people think about Civil 3D, they often assume it requires BIM modelers (in a sense, just glorified drafters) to create all the necessary catalogs and styles, and to assist with their use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Civil 3D plugin will:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Make standard, market-compliant catalogs and polished styles available to engineers at large. Think of it as the WordPress theme provider equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Make the entire process easy and painless through the plugin, with prominent buttons for quick access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the plugin is done well, there will be less need for BIM modelers, since for a fee, engineers could simply purchase catalogs and styles that are so easy to use they require no technical training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a side benefit, I also get to explore how LLMs can help me write code. It has been a while since I last updated my AI usage policy [0], and I look forward to revisiting it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a desktop app that lets you ask questions on your data files like csv, json, parquet and excel in plain english without incurring heavy LLM costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launched a new plan as well that gives unlimited question-answering for just $20/month. Truly unlimited, no strings attached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there a cadence for these threads? I had in mind to "be prepared" to post in November's with what I'm working on, but I expected it to come around on the 15th (mid-month).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(The proprietary apps are built with the toolkit).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've struggled to pitch or articulate the vision here, but my latest pithy attempt is: scaling self-actualization by mechanizing the nested loops described by Anders Ericson's 'deliberate practice' - Inner loop: individual learners maximize their skill uptake velocity and performance peak by adhering to domain specific best practices - Outer loop: domain specific best practices get refined according to innovation or serendipitous discoveries from the inner loop (eg, someone is observed to beat out prior best practices)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I'm flat-foot posting here, so the pages aren't all prepped. https://flutor.app/dbg and https://letterspractice.com/dbg show some of the innards. Not linked, but I'm especially fond of https://letterspractice.com/dbg/juggling - the premise here that as child practices the letters, the letters exemplify the principles of effective practice in alliterative skill domains (juggling Js, batting Bs, flossing Fs (it's hard ok?))&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on MemoryPlugin (https://www.memoryplugin.com), a tool that adds long term memory across AI tools&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve worked on a chat history based memory feature that can recall information from every conversation you’ve ever had with ChatGPT and Claude. It’s been particularly useful and also technically fun to implement. Speed has been very important as I do just in time summarisation and a multi stage RAG pipeline, and most LLMs have unacceptable performance. I ended up going with GPT-OSS on Groq due to its ultra low latency often completing full generations before Gemini or ChatGPT APIs return even the first token.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability to recall details from conversations going back years makes tasks where I want personalised plans or feedback like 10x more useful, at times I get the AI to ingest tens of thousands of tokens of context to help me better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My 7 year old niece loves jigsaw puzzles, but a lot of the time I see her during family trips where taking puzzles along wouldn't be feasible. We usually have an iPad though. I plan to add more puzzle categories soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://lunchtrain.se/ A one glance page to find what to eat for lunch in Lindholmen, Gothenburg, Sweden&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on this made it really clear to me how a LLM can bring real value to a backend, it excels on processing very differently structured dynamic data (something if done without an LLM would require quite specific code - which would lead to more development time and increase time to market)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://fooqux.com/ - an experimental tech article aggregator. For several years now, I've had a routine of collecting articles on topics that interest me throughout the week and then reading them over the weekend. To help organize and streamline this process, I created this website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main idea is to gather tech articles in one place and process them with a LLM — categorize them, generate summaries, and try experimental features like annotations, questions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this service might be useful to others as well. You can sign up with github account to submit your articles as well. I would appreciate any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am trying to build a local setup where I spawn dockers (fetched via skopeo) as systemd-nspawn machines in userland (rootless), with network managed by a service that uses netkit devices to setup network in their empty network namespaces. I am looking at using Sommelier to manage wayland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end goal is to have a laptop with an easy way to build lab environments which is secure and rootless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted a simple retrieval index to use splade sparse vectors. This just encodes and serializes documents into flatbuffers and appends them into shards. Retrieval is just parallel flat scan, optionally with reranking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is just a simple, portable index for smaller data sizes. I’m targeting high quality hybrid retrieval, for local search, RAG or deep research scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SPLADE is a really nice “in-between” for semantic and lexical search. There’s bigger and better indexes out there like Faiss or Anserini, but I just kinda wanted something basic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was testing it on 120k docs in a simple cli the other day and it’s still as good as any web search experience (in terms of latency) — so I think it’ll be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re still trying to clean up the API and do a thorough once over, so I’m not sure I’d recommend trying it yet. Hopefully soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new spin on my slow baking location intelligence data union (https://wherelabs.info). This week I’m thinking about whether it makes sense to provide a location history ‘vault’, designed to let users expose their location history to LLM’s as context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DIY grid-tied residential solar+inverter+battery. Trying to design the solar arrays' tilt mechanism now for lifting/lowering 5 panels at a time in winter (60-degree winter angle, 35-degree spring/summer/fall; ~24" difference). Thinking either two linear actuators, or a single hydraulic jack connected to multiple support beams. The weight isn't much, but I want a way to lift entire top edge at once to prevent twisting. Linear actuators are slightly more money and easier to build, but require power and weather-proofing. Jack is cheaper, but more complex to distribute force. Wondering if there's other options. (winch would require more robust/taller rear posts, seems more complex, might shade rear array)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilting them vertical or nearly so is very useful if there could be any hail, that might be a good idea to support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about compressed air? It might not be too hard to find a small brushless low power air pump that could drive pistons directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could mount the pump controller onto the back of the panels and use an accelerometer to measure angle, and run the pump until it's where you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'd probably need to do some testing and make sure it couldn't get jammed, then build up pressure, then suddenly unstick and move unsafely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! And I've seen Dave's tests. Since I don't need a fixed angle, do need to maximize production (due to a limited sun horizon), and only have 10 panels, the best option is adjusting angle during winter. The N-S orientation is a really poor performer. (Notice that his test is 30-degree tilt vs N-S; 60-degree tilt will provide 20-25% more power than 30-degree at my latitude, without even considering bifacials w/snow. The only thing that would produce more is an active tracker, but I've got other things to do, and a December deadline...)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learning that RCS is even more of a monstrosity and a lie than I thought a few years ago. Yikes. Lots of groundwork a decade ago setting the stage for "the carrier creates a common service anyone can interact with" (like sms/mms currently do, which would be great) but in practice it's pretty much 100% "only the carrier app or Google/Samsung messages has access to literally any of it".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah I'm not gonna touch it and I'm going to actively encourage people to disable it. Use signal instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Completely bootstrapped online counseling platform focused on affordability ($25/week!), accessibility and doing the right thing by clients and therapists. Currently only available in NY, FL, TX and Singapore with plans to expand as budget allows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A hierarchical text canvas for organizing thoughts and taking notes. I wrote v1 years ago and now spent about year rewriting it in SwiftUI and adding all my dream features like reminders, deep linking, and lots more. Currently in TestFlight beta, nearing release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on Buckaroo - my table display library for dataframes in notebook environments. Buckaroo adds table and analytics features like histograms, summary stats, sorting, and search to every dataframe. Recently I have been working to make it work better with large datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This involves making it lazy for polars, allowing it to read arbitrarily large files no longer requiring loading the entire dataframe into memory. When a large dataframe initially displays, no summary stats will be available. Summary stats are computed in the background in groups of columns. Then results are cached per column. To accomplish this I wrote a polars plugin in rust that computes hashes of columns. Dealing with large data like this is tricky, operations sometimes crash, sometimes take all available memory, and sometimes they just run for a very long time. I have also been building an execution framework for Buckaroo. It uses multiprocessing based timeouts, and the caching to execute summary stats in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being able to control the execution, recover from timeouts, crashes and memory exhaustion opens up some interesting debugging tools. I have written methods that take arbitrary groups of polars expressions and produce a minimal reproduction test case through a git-bisect like process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this assures that if individual columns of a dataframe fits into memory, summary stats will be computed for the entire dataframe in the background. And because it is cached, the next time you open the same dataframe, the stats will be display instantly. When exploring data I do this in an adhoc way manually (splitting up a dataframe by columns and rows), but it is error prone. This should all be automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will be presenting this at PyData Boston in December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Column's the limit: interactive exploration of larger than memory data sets in a notebook with Polars and Buckaroo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been writing https://urbanismnow.com weekly for a year. The idea is to bring you the best ideas from around the world to inspire action where you (c)are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been going well for a side project and now I'm thinking of expanding to have a directory of urbanists on a map so you can easily find people involved in the local discourse and how to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm wrapping up a v0 of a personal website soon [1]. This has been kinda "coming soon" for almost 7 years now - every single time I attempted it in the past, I would stop it prematurely due to a lot of yak shaving and I could never finish it fully. Or more commonly, I would get bombarded with busy times as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm happy where it's landing so far but also appreciate any actionable feedback to make it better (!). Under the hood, it packs a Rust Axum API, plenty of ffmpeg, and some hobo infrastructure [2] here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am finally making my own blog. I have been only planning for ages. I found that I had a lot to say for the past years working on AI, and I want to record them somewhere. I do not expect a lot of visitors or at all in fact. The blog is going to be just for me to remember stuffs and to keep track of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am using hugo to build suckless static pages. LLM helped me so that I don't need to read all their docs. I haven't finished it yet nor posted a single blog. But there will be one soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just launched a 10-Bit Video Thumbnail Provider for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows does not natively support rendering thumbnails for 10-bit videos, which are commonly produced by cameras like the Sony A7IV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started working on a short film the video clips were piling up on my hard drive. Opening them one by one to find what I was looking for was tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could not find a reputable solution to this problem, so I started a company and built one. I went through the process of EV Certification to have the installer and executable code signed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope to be in the Microsoft Store soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also building other utilities with similar purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on boiling the ocean - we're building a new CRM to compete with some of the big players. I tried very hard to avoid doing this, but I've helped enough business owner friends set up CRMs to realize there's MUCH to be desired. My goal is to create a CRM that people rave about - something that is very rare. Pretty much everyone I help views CRMs as a necessary evil. Our bold challenge is - can we make a CRM that is delightful to use?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course we have to slap "AI" on it in this market, but we plan on adding AI features that are actually thoughtful and not just a glorified chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds interesting! As someone who works in Revenue Operations the CRM space is ripe for disruption, especially around using CRM data to help sales teams explore the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I vibecoded a POC of what something I think would work (around the latter part around exploring the data). Need to complete it and start testing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! I totally agree. It starts with getting the basics right. I think this is where most CRMs get it wrong - getting users to correctly enter and maintain clean data is a challenge. We're trying to build smarter schemas for contacts, quotes, sales, etc. but we're also making a really intuitive UI for easily updating information. Further still, we're trying to automatically fill in data for the customer. Many fields can be automatically inferred based on the context of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we get this right, I think the next step is exactly what you said, building really good tools to explore the data. Making it easy for non-technical users to run machine learning on their data to make business decisions or see cool visualizations. We realize that so many of our customers want to know this stuff and have no way of getting at it! We've got a lot of ideas for both visualizing and analyzing the data. I think there's a ton of potential for cool things here. Heatmaps, spiderwebs, interactive charts, etc. Stuff that brings the data to life. One of the common asks from some of our early customers is a heatmap of the world to visualize their sales/reach and see changes over time. Visualizing progress per sales region, etc. I think sales especially has a lot of opportunities for better lead generation and qualification as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i'm currently unemployed but i have experience as a CSM and account manager for multiple companies (all have used Salesforce) if you ever want feedback or bounce ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This would be awesome, we're in hardcore MVP build mode right now - when we get closer to launch I'll hit you up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a little delusional, but I think there's ground to steal back from Salesforce. Most folks I talk to hate how complicated Salesforce is (one even calls it Salesfarce). I've heard a story or two about smaller companies trying to adopt it and wasting a hundred thousand or two implementing Salesforce only to have it never get used. On top of that, you need to train your employees to use Salesforce effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key is simplicity, building a CRM that anyone can instantly understand just by looking at it. This is insanely hard but I think we'll pull it off. I'll show you more what I mean when I reach out. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to learn 3D scanning and printing: I have a few small projects that I want to do to develop the skill:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to 3D print a shell that goes over my car fob: I keep leaning on it and setting off the alarm. The shell would make sure the buttons never get pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to 3D print a sleeve that keeps the NCAS dongle in my car charger. I really wish there was a dongle that stayed attached with screws or similar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a book about using WebViews for cross-platform music software GUIs. It has a particular focus on performance, which I gave a talk about at the Audio Developer Conference last year:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A website that lets you match watches with different straps to get a feel for how it'll look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mixing and matching watches with different straps is something that I really enjoy doing. It's not often easy to tell ahead of time whether the combination will work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on this and some things will definitely change, but IMO the system prompt is already solid, so that the response isn't unnecessarily scary on one hand, but not too general on the other&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfrotunatelly, it happens and I am aware of this. In that case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a) you are lucky because your CV is not scannable by AI so it's good if you want to keepyoru carieer as far as possible from AI tools ;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b) you are unlucky: most likely the software recruiters are using to pre-screen applications (and they are using it a lot) is not seeing your CV either so you will be dropped on the first stage, :( work on this if you consider finding new job nowadays&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;c) if you still want to use my tool consider extracting CV's text to .txt or reformat PDF (this will help you with point b)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Python Framework called Artanis, inspired by ExpressJS, to make it easier for JS devs to work with Python ecosystem: https://nordxai.github.io/Artanis/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You submit heavy duty jobs without worrying about infra, and we take care of execution. We're starting with PDF extraction. Audio transcoding + STT (speech to text) is next. Video transcoding will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows you to have $5/mo VPS and get media operations figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A place to find great blog articles by regular folks related to dev/tech world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wondering about the best way I can add a weekly newsletter built on top of the content currently being ingested and still looking for more sources to add to the database (let me know if you have any good recommendations).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on something similar but with a different view. I like to get random essay to read whenever I am bored or in-between tasks. So I developed this: https://read2reflect.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have added only about 35 essays for now. Might pick up some from your list too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polishing my dashboard for tracking profit on Solana blockchain for set of wallets: https://imgur.com/813aQsO&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to extend it with a simple overview of most recent profitable wallets to look for new "metas" that i could profit on. This project may or may not end as open source eventually, but i currently keep it private.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out my project at https://www.MobiusClock.com: A 3D WebGL Clock on a Möbius Strip that shows 24hr time on a 12hr face. The hour indicator follows the edge of the strip, thus must make 2 turns to return to its starting point, giving you a 24 hour clock. The minute and second indicators move along the middle of the strip and thus return to their starting points in only one turn. Has the ability to rotate!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just added a new feature: a 'Fast Mode' button to temporarily speed up the hands, which helps visualize how the slow-moving parts work, how the hour indicator moves along the edge. Would love feedback on the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you happen to have an old or spare iPad or tablet, you can open my mobius clock page in a browser and set it on a shelf (plugged in of course). Kind of like a weird wall clock...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm thinking a lot about the ARC-AGI ML benchmarks, especially the "shape" of the dataset and what that says about how it should be solved. I think there's good reasons to believe that deep learning - at least differentiable SGD backprop style - is a bad fit for this specific benchmark, due to the tasks being almost entirely discrete symmetries, and also having so little data to approximate the discrete symmetries with continuous ones (considering deep learning to be the learning of continuous symmetries). I think that a more explicit and discrete approach is the way to go, and it's possible to build something surprisingly general and not heuristic-based even without gradient descent, guided by minimum description length to search for both grid representations and solver functions. I'm looking for teammates for ARC-3 so hit me up if this sounds interesting, I'd love to chat!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made a viewer on my website to build intuition for my preferred perception algorithm which is entropy filtering + correlation. Pretty neat to check out the heatmaps for random tasks, there is a lot of information inherent in the heatmap about the structure of the task: https://synapsomorphy.com/arc/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a website (https://hpyhn.xyz) for hacker news users for reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. hn comments are valuable, I've spent a lot of time going through hn comments. I think there are valuable comments buried in the threads with fewer points, so it's not enough to just read top3 threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Sometimes a good post is ignored due to a bad title, sometimes I still have no idea what the post's theme even after I read a few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. I want to filter out some posts I'm not interested in, but I realized I need read some other posts it's not a simple yes/no problem, so I gave every post a interesting score based on my own preference&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;so I want a tool to save my time while not missing out too much on hn&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use codex and claude code daily, also build apps with openai and anthropic api keys, so i always go to openai dashboard and anthropic dashboard to track my usage. Since I spend most of times inside cursor or terminal, I wanted to quickly check my usage without leaving my terminal/ide, so i built this!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's open-source, MIT, and built with ratatui (awesome name).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone can post an idea for something they wish existed — an app, a game, a tool, or anything else — and share it. When more people back an idea, it gains momentum and starts getting built, either by AI or by community makers. The goal is to turn crowd energy into real progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will allow users to fully manage their calendar in a Gantt chart. Complete with customizations like dependencies between events, custom colors for time blocks and custom icons for single-day events (“milestone”-like).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ganttify is a Gantt chart add-on for web applications or services that can benefit from a Gantt view. My goal is to expand the number of integrations for Ganttify and release a new integration every month or so. If any of you have an interesting (niche or non-niche) idea to integrate Ganttify with feel free to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve gone old school. After reviewing a few people’s CV’s the easiest format was for me to record a video with the feedback, so I put a site together for that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are a service to help brands navigate the new world of AI agents. Currently focused on helping them increase visibility in AI search but we plan to go beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are building end-to-end accessibility compliance tool[1] that will take care of auditing, remediation, verification and generation of ACR/VPAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the well bound nature of the problem space, we are able to unlock a lot of power from LLMs and put together a good end-to-end product that delivers the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still early days. I know there are lot of folks who care about a11y. I would love to chat and learn from your experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very interested in this type of thing. I can't see anywhere where pricing is mentioned, even ranges would be a useful benchmark to know if it's something within budget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I continue to work on My Financé, my personal finance tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been struggling to find substantive traction, so I’m trying to niche down to make the tool really helpful for people who want to quit their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a rudimentary planning and forecasting engine, and am trying to run paid ads to see if the signals resonate with people. I don’t love ads, but maybe trying to understand them will further inform my opinion on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I would love to come up with is a way to make the app fully local first, while continuing the ability to sync accounts via plaid. It would be great to not be able to see people’s data at all. Im trying to figure out if there is a good user experience I could provide while minimizing the amount of data I actually have access too. Maybe this feature won’t matter to my primary customers though, I’m not really sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still have a ton of fun working on it, and if it never really makes any money I consider it a great success for my personal learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anti-spam email/messaging protocol that is simple, cheap to implement, directly compatible with email/messengers, low false negative rate compared to current spam filtering, free for senders, and does not require the sender to pay to send a message. For people who receive too much marketing spam, survey spam, low-effort cold emails, and want to be able to easily filter spam successfully because you do not want to waste time on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Future-proofed and will work on AI spam in the future too, unlike current spam filtering methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building a WebAssembly WASI runtime for exaequOS (https://exaequos.com), an OS fully running in the Web browser. It will support WASI 0.1 and 0.2. Basic implementation can be tested by running ‘wex’ in the terminal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://mimicmarketer.com It allows you to define different personas that you can then test marketing on. This allows you to see how different personas will interact with your marketing. Currently, it has a feature that allows you to define basic personas and test them against two types of copy, as well as a tool that grades your email subject lines and bodies against a generic persona, assessing the likelihood of user interaction with the content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My other project is https://eggexplorer.com This is a site I wish I had when building out my flock of chickens. It allows you to see the different characteristics of chickens and which hatcheries sell each different breed. You can also see which hatcheries sell hatching eggs for each breed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bread and butter stuff. Pulling together all of the assorted algorithms and data structures I implemented in C over the years out of necessity - lists, trees, stacks, queues, hash tables, memory pools, etc. - aligning the APIs, cleaning up and merging into a library. It's a background project but super fun. This and several parsers - JSON, some config file formats, and parsers for some GPS / GNSS receiver data protocols. FSMs also always feel like nice, clean fun. And prematurely optimising every bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a performance capture library for Python because I often need to know the performance of backend systems I maintain. I frequently build tooling to capture performance and save it for later analysis. I/O operations get costly when writing lots of data to disk and creating good real-time analytics tools takes a lot of my time. I wanted a library that captures real-time performance analytics from Python backends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why I wrote kronicler to record performance metrics while being fast and simple to implement. I built my own columnar database in Rust to capture and analyze these logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To capture logs, `import kronicler` and add `@kronicler.capture` as a decorator to functions in Python. It will then start saving performance metrics to the custom database on disk. You can also use the middleware for FastAPI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then view these performance metrics by adding a route to your server called `/logs` where you return `DB.logs()`. You can paste your hosted URL into the settings of usekronicler.com (the online dashboard) and view your data with a couple charts. View the readme or the website for more details for how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still working on features like concurrency and other overall improvements. I've added a lot since the last time I shared on HN. I would love some feedback to help shape this product into something useful for you all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created a RescueTime alternative for KDE Plasma. It runs in the background as a daemon and records time spent on each window in a SQLite database. Next step here would be to add a Firefox extension, since a lot of my time is spent browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tracking windows on Wayland is hard because the protocol doesn't support it. I hacked together a script using Claude Code that somehow works, but I barely understand how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After creating the feature request for Claude Code hooks[1] a few months back, Cupcake is nearly ready for release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cupcake is a governance/policy-enforcement layer for agents. Its innovation is binding OPA/rego to agent runtimes (via hooks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not believe we will every strictly rely on "better" models in the wild without deterministic guarantees or ways for enterprises to factor in their own alignment - system prompts dont cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a survival game in the line of MC, Valheim and Vintage Story. Last months have been focused on developing the survival core mechanics on top of building and fighting. Im now entering in the final phase of wiring all the pieces together. Streaming the process daily on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Bespoke software for the group including: shared embedding graph of highlights and annotations, IRC chat with @ for members and books and authors, collective bookshelf&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a stablecoin account for workers in LATAM. It helps them protect their earnings from inflation and makes doing taxes easier. (https://www.useairsend.com)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FURS does for Forth, what headers do for C, namely provide all the embedded configuration information inside a Cortex-M MCU, for the up to 100 inbuilt peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without this data, neither C nor Forth (or any other language) have any clue about how to use the peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FURS does this by intercepting the Forth user source as it's uploaded to the on-chip compiler and transforming it into language the MCU inherently understands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Forth user source code is not altered in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've used the Fossil DCVS for the entire FURS project so that all the flowcharts, pictures, code, user doc, trouble-ticket, wiki ... everything is contained in the ONE FILE, under 5MB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one file gives you a web server so all you need is a browser to easily view all the above from the main menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building Sink It for Reddit (https://gosinkit.com), a browser extension to make Reddit usable on the web. It’s similar to RES with broader support for all the different Reddit UIs (there are 4).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s mostly free with only old Reddit features gated behind a one time $5 fee. The app has a few hundred thousand users on the Apple platforms but recently it was invited to join Mozilla’s Recommended Extensions program so I’m hoping to grow the non-Apple user base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a lot of what I work on is my classes giving me less time to open source nowadays, but I have also worked in implementing and mashing new Papers coming out in Robotics. Anyone who wants to talk more should please connect!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loads of similar products out there, but non that did all of: open source code with attested releases, recorded mic and system audio to work with any meeting app and used Apple Intelligence for private summarisation. In beta, and also just released a experimental version with self hosted Ollama support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on two game development projects for the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One project is for building rhythm games in multiple game engines and multiple platforms. Currently, it works in Unity, Unreal, Godot, SDL (or any C++ game engine), and MonoGame (or any C# game engine), and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. I'm working on adding Love2d (or any Lua game engine) and Bevy (or any Rust game engine). I have a few local prototypes of it working in Unity and Godot, but nothing public yet. Still trying to figure out what kind of game I want to make with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other is a general purpose game engine in C++ with SDL. It's far enough along that I'm building games in it, but it's more of an exploration into how games are made than a replacement for Unity or Godot. I suppose it could be eventually, but I'm trying to be realistic with what it can do. One thing I'm pretty happy with regarding this engine is that one of the demo repos will automatically build to WebGL and publish to itch.io when changes are pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on training language models steered towards certain "states of consciousness".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a model trained on publics datasets tied to brainwaves and/eye tracking and text comprehension (have this working well enough to experiment). Now I am training an adapter for various llm architectures to generate text steered to certain neural oscillation patterns (let's call them "states of consciousness" for brevity). I also have a 'rephraser' that rephrases text to elicit these certain states of consciousness. Overall experimenting with creating an suite of tools off my findings with how text relates to the eigenmodes of consciousness. My theory is once I do this I'll be able to do some...interesting things with "AI" agents. lmk if you want to talk about it if you're someone with knowledge in neuroscience/ML. My background is as a Software/ML Engineer so I could use additional thoughts. I do wish I could send a Github/docs which I will soon but this is currently a private project seeking investment for various research/public/private sector applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A game-agnostic social/legal/financial overlay for virtual worlds. Minecraft, Rust, Roblox, etc.: legal ownership claims (vs possession), titles (recognized by other players or not), laws, player-issued currencies. Smart contracts but with as little blockchain stuff as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The iron rule is no direct interaction with the world. These are things that players can in theory always start on their own as long as they can communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a pet project for myself. I love listening to online radio while at work, helps me focus. But I didn't really click with any of the current selection of web apps out there so decided to build one myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses the great API available at radio-browser.info for all the radio information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been using it as a way to learn how to market a website as well. Learning a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would suggest that you filter out any radio stations where the URL isn't working if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example I filtered down to "United Kingdom" and then "bass" - 3 of the 6 worked and would rather see ones that are active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also if possible to apply the country filter within the search bar, took me a second to realise I had to open the filter for country, select that, then go back to my search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When clearing my search of "Bass" in the example above, it reset the search to default (didn't have my country filter) even though the filter was still applied when opening the filter section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Super easy interface to use though, really well done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools to help my mental health tracking[0], and sharing with others how I manage my limited amount of energy[1]. They're kind of related, since mental health impacts my energy, so I've needed to prioritize and really make sure I'm spending my time and energy on things that matter. Usually, there's a good mix of things I enjoy doing with things I gain a lot out of. I've spent a lot of time thinking about this!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've used my app in various forms for around 5 years, rewritten multiple times. But now I'm creating surrounding tooling to help others put my mental model for personal life prioritize to use. I'm writing in the "Saving Spoons" Substack as I go, trying to explain why and how I do things, with advice for others trying to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building my take on a low-touch task completion assistant designed to counter distraction and hyper-habituation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's starting off as a MacOS app because that's the machine I have. I didn't know Swift or SwiftUI when I started. I now know them somewhat, but the entire app has been vibe-coded. This has made it slow going. Very "1 step forward 2 steps back" until I switched from Claude Code to Codex and GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm hoping to start an initial beta within the family in the next week or two, and then a wider round in January.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I am implementing tag-triggered webhooks so they can get triggered based on the tags assigned to messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use case: for example, I want to auto-tweet all my advice messages and auto-create linear tasks for `company` todos, auto-start a cursor agent when I tag messages with `Cursor task`&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason, I got 16 users out of nowhere, so I added a landing page last week. The connector marketplace is next, so that I can share these sub-connectors with the other users. Need a couple more weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Argon Chess, a deterministic chess variant with some degree of cheat resistance (hard to describe to chess engines like Fairy Stockfish) and tons of variety. A week ago, I added a way to play friends online a week ago (a Discord Activity) and a simple Play a Dumb AI feature on its website. You can also print the cards for free for offline play. https://argonchess.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finished: the 100%-vibe-coded "GPT-5 reviews all my PRs on max reasoning" GitHub app (which is shockingly effective, https://github.com/Smaug123/robocop - probably nothing new for people who already use some product like this, but I like owning my own infrastructure as far as possible, and GPT-5 and perhaps Gemini are the only models smart enough to do this so I can't take this any further).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently: back on "write an immediate-mode TUI framework that uses a vdom as its fundamental abstraction" (https://github.com/Smaug123/WoofWare.Zoomies), in the hope that this is the first UI framework that I don't absolutely loathe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next: using the TUI framework, write a debugger to inspect the internal state of my deterministic .NET runtime (https://github.com/Smaug123/WoofWare.PawPrint) and to step forward and backward in time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next: get the deterministic .NET runtime to a point where a property-based testing framework can identify the deadlock in some very simple buggy multithreaded code. (The framework is not yet able to run Hello World - did you know that's an incredibly complicated program in .NET? - but it can solve a few Advent of Code problems right now, can perform some limited exception handling, limited virtual method dispatch, limited casting between types. Even getting to Hello World might take a year if I'm unlucky.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect AI company want improved efficiencies and developing a framework that can be applied in determining the minimal-energy, maximal-efficiency architecture for ai models. Calculating the precise limits, like a Cognitive Event Horizon, where a model becomes so complicated it literally costs more energy to run than the knowledge it provides, and the Semantic Horizon, where it simply gets too complex to be accurate, etc. Lots of cool implications such as around a fundamental mathematical maximum learning rate which results in trying to get anywhere close to that that by doing stuff like aggressively filtering of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curated LinkedIn topics + AI drafting: validating before building&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm exploring building a weekly curation service for professionals who want to write on LinkedIn but struggle with "what's worth writing about."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thesis: In the AI era, execution (writing) is commoditized. The real bottleneck is editorial judgment... knowing what topics matter before they're obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concept: Weekly email with 5-7 curated topics (tech trends, policy shifts, market movements). Each topic comes with sources, multiple angles, and context Choose your perspective, AI drafts a polished article&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why I think this could work: I've been manually doing this for myself for years. Pattern recognition at scale is hard to automate, but pairing human curation with AI execution might work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target market: ~30M professionals who should be building thought leadership but don't have time to spend on research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current status: Validating demand before building. The hard part isn't the AI, it's systematizing the trend-spotting and curation process without losing signal quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on SuperCurate (https://getsupercurate.com), which is geared towards note retrieval and curation rather than note creation. Think filing cabinet for your notes, web clippings, images and PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted fast search and filters for my Evernote archive so I could drill down and surface exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm making a game finally! Merge-three + village sim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hoping to actually take this one to something polished as opposed to the many half-finished prototypes littering my git repo over the years. I've discovered (always knew?) that heavily cutting scope is the best way, and been successful thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It gets pretty boring/unbalanced by ~150 turns, but I have some ideas on how to fix. I'm still playing with ways to help de-clutter the board and make use of the economy aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some false starts with ai-gen art, I had fun learning to color the pixels myself. The process wasn't as scary as I'd thought and the results are better than I hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on _prompt injection_, the problem where LLMs can't reliably distinguish between the user's instructions and untrusted content like web search results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? I love the old arcade and game boy games, and I want to recreate them to my liking. I also love mechanical systems and space rovers, and I want ro build worlds to explore and simulate these things&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to keep it simple but I can already feel some "design pressure" to think about making the DSL more complete (language) by adding features like loops and variables. Still early days!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building https://unrav.io : A tool to fight information overload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It lets you turn any article, YouTube video, or PDF into summaries, mindmaps, podcasts, chat conversations or infographics that match how you learn with just one click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We just launched this week the Chrome extension so you can do all this in one click on any page, no login needed (with generous freemium usage).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://yap.town - an SRS based language learning app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would say it combines the best parts of Duolingo and Anki. Anki is great for memorizing words, but you don't see the words in the context of novel sentences. Duolingo is great for exposure to new sentences, but it's oriented around "lessons" and SRS is an afterthought. (Duolingo is also not designed for people serious about learning a language IMO, it's too easy and goes too slowly.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Had to do quite a bit to get it to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. At first you would think that if you know all the words in a sentence, that should be enough to understand the sentence. But it doesn't work like that. For starters, words can have multiple meanings. The french word "bois" can mean "(you) drink" or "wood". You want to learn these separately. I trained an NLP model (a gemma3 finetune) that I use to understand the manner each word is used in each sentence: https://huggingface.co/collections/anchpop/lexide-nlp-models&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Even then, what about a sentence like "you'd better not"? Even if you know the words "you" "had" "better" and "not", you still won't really get this. So I use the wiktionary "multiword terms" category for each language to get a huge list of terms like "'d better" , "you better believe it", etc, and teach these in addition to individual words. And then I only show sentences where you know all the individual words as well as all the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I'm not planning to get rich off of it haha. Right now there's no monetization at all. If lots of people use it to learn a language and avoid wasting their time on duolingo, I'll be happy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most obvious features, at first glance, are no commas and no need for escape characters. Other useful features include processing instructions, extensible data-substitution rules, and support for comments. Currently only implemented in .NET; plans are to rewrite the core in Rust and provide language wrappers around that core.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sounds very interesting. You say “native” but miso generates JavaScript, right? I’m not familiar with mobile development. Can you run JS natively on mobile devices?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've done this with C++ in the past, but ran into substantial friction with the CMake toolchain, specifically w.r.t:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- cross-platform compilation with large dependencies (vcpkg ports)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- running multiple compiler chains in the same build step&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That second point is necessary if, for example, there's some AOT asset processing work that uses a native tool, and you're building for web. Expressing that some targets should use the emscripten toolchain while others should use the native toolchain, and interleaving between them, was a mess. TBF, I haven't done that with cargo or build.rs yet and it may prove to be equally frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- undo/redo using a stack of swappable states&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- serialization to disk (native) and LocalStorage (web) with some integration tests in progress but I am not satisfied with the correctness of my implementation: I want to *guarantee* that all information is preserved round-trip, but I also want a Patek watch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- OBJ, GLTF, GLB models are loaded as "blueprint scenes" which are distinct from the "world scene." I made this distinction at the type-level because "scenes" are groups of entities that use newtype IDs (`LightId(u64)`, `MeshId(u64)` etc.) as primary and foreign keys to refer to each other, and I wanted to make it impossible for an entity in scene A to hold an ID for an entity in scene B. Instantiating a blueprint requires creating new IDs for every object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- W.I.P. Alpha rendering, depth sorting, overhauling the material system to support multiple shaders (tough) that may be compiled after the engine itself (even tougher, a lot of runtime dynamic state and schema validation stuff), physics, scripting - oh yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Scripting using JS on both web (runs in browser itself) and desktop (uses a packaged JS runtime `Boa`) but Boa doesn't perform well on desktop in debug mode so I'm exploring other options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a docs website [1] for my speech-to-text CLI tool, hns. I use it 5-10 times daily to transcribe my voice, and a few developer friends I've shared it with have also adopted it for daily use. They like that it runs in the terminal and keeps all data local. So, felt like I should write down guides for new users to get started quickly and to highlight key use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building this documentation website using Docusaurus. This is my first time using Docusaurus, and it feels like a very nice tool for quickly developing a documentation website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Reflect [0], it’s a privacy-focused app for self-tracking and self-discovery. You can track metrics, run self-experiments, set goals, view correlations, visualize your data, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imo, you really should use a pure white background for the App Store screenshots instead of the current greyish background which looks kind of depressing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building Your Next Store (YNS); it's a Shopify alternative built with React and Next.js.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We provide an opinionated boilerplate tailored for tools like Claude or Codex, so designers and developers can build storefronts faster and more easily. It enforces a clear structure to start from while keeping full control over design, animations, and the overall storefront experience. It’s built on top of Stripe, with our higher-level commerce abstractions, like "add to cart", "checkout", "pay", "browse products" etc; plus a Commerce CMS so merchants can manage everything smoothly once their store is live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If youre planning to sell something online and want a modern solution, hit me up! :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every hour, new Queens Puzzle (LinkedIn style) is available to play. No leaderboard, no stats, nothing to buy, just pure play. Every user gets the exact same puzzle to solve for that UTC hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would love to get some feedback from the community!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workflows and Case Management for Lending use cases like Small and Medium Business loans and Merchant Cash Advances. I'm working as the Product Designer on these features for a Document Data Extraction AI company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frontend framework in JavaScript that requires no build step, relies on DOM and SSR and can be used to build both SPA and hybrid apps without VDOM, js templates, hydration or putting HTML (or worse, css) inside JS code. It'll also have a very sophisticated declarative state manager which makes managing state and ui transitions a breeze. It's basically anti-React.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure: https://code.qount25.dev/qite/qite-js No docs yet, but I suggest you go to test/demo for examples. You can actually see them work if you run it with `node test/server.js`.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My backhand is OK but my forehand sucks. Grip styles for standard handles usually end up favoring one side or the other. I'm making a handle shape that's easier to get the blade angle right on both sides. Hopefully a couple more iterations on the 3D printer and then I can have a functional prototype made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with a group of friends on a "microcontroller-for-makers" kind of thing called the MakerPort. (https://makerport.fun) Sort of similar to an Arduino or micro:bit, but uses the MicroBlocks programming editor (https://microblocks.fun) created by John Maloney, who was the original team leader for Scratch at MIT for 11 years. The hardware includes an mp3 player, I2C ports, accelerometer and true capacitive touch sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of sending the page's HTML to an LLM, Hikugen asks it to generate python code to fetch the data and enforces the generated data conforms to a Pydantic schema defined by the user. I'm using this to power yomu (https://github.com/goncharom/yomu), a personal email newsletter built from arbitrary websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just launched a startup/life style business where I use AI to help people practice for upcoming interviews - https://hiredcoach.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Already have been told by some users that the interview prep they got from it has correctly predicted several of the actual interview questions they got, crediting its prep for their breezing through the interview rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing a fingerprinting method for identifying music masterings! Like Shazam but to tell what version of an album you have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea being able to compare measurements to see what mastering you're really getting - because they are NOT all equal. With the remasters and stealth replacements on streaming, it seems like every other month I wake up one day and my favorite music sounds worse (or is gone...). Now I can measure it and help find what versions I really want to collect!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I may end up trying to make a fingerprint database/tool that sits in between MusicBrainz and Discogs. That way hopefully the community can standardize and quantify some of this info that only lives ad hoc in Steve Hoffman forum threads or partially on sites like https://dr.loudness-war.info&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been building a little toy computer and assembly language that's interpreted in python. Pretty close to the first release (and introductory blog post) and a lot of fun to build (and learn a bit more about real assembly as I go).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://SightRead.org - free, ad-free, etc, vanilla js (except for the abcjs notation library) web app to practice sight reading. Currently rhythm-only, but more is planned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on my digital nomad event and workation aggregator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now with travel and visa guides to help remote workers become productive in Japan and South Korea ASAP and give them visa guidance if they want to stay a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://web-framework.com, a lightweight PHP framework on Slim and PHP-DI for ORM, caching, auth, etc. (an alternative to Laravel/Symfony for small apps).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally started in 2012, I’m (still) building log.soccer - a stat-tracking tool for amateur soccer players. This is the third or fourth iteration of the site, which until this year mostly served as a glorified résumé project to showcase the latest framework or tool I had just learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to ChatGPT, my productivity went through the roof this year, and I finally shipped an MVP that might actually be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a standard Django + React + AWS stack. My raison d’être is to build an Apple Watch app that tracks match scores in real time. 2026 hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://recipin.com Recipe extraction and archiving to avoid link rot and blog spam. No tracking, no JavaScript, no AI[0], and just a dusting of CSS. Source available to run your own server if you’d like (https://github.com/bradly/recipin).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to add importing from a Pinterest account and continue adding support for all the creative implementations of the schema.org recipe format that different sites use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[0] My partner has a bunch of handwritten family recipes, so I’m trying out an optional extract from a photo of a hand written or magazine recipe that uses AI. Not required and I may pull it out into its own service that spits out schema.org recipes. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is lightweight, composable tools with clean interfaces that respect user agency and privacy, provide technical clarity, and make you a better photographer by encouraging mastery over your tools and offering new ways to approach picture making. Also broadly honoring the (almost) 2 century old history of the craft and drawing inspiration from pre-digital processes and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Got a number of updates to existing apps and new ones in the works, I’m excited for the full long term vision I have that I plan to sum up in an essay at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently Apple platforms only but the plan is also to break out of that down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building one project a week for the next 25 weeks for my newsletter. First, I want interesting content for the newsletter. Second, I want to try to grow the newsletter to put out something fun and joyous. The world needs more good fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on building a chatgpt wrapper with real time stock market data. More than 70% investors are using Chatgpt for their investment analysis these days, but the data is quite dated since it's all based on web search. Trying to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helping my recent MBA grad sister make a simple python script to fit here resume to a JD using openAI's api. Shes applting to product and marketing roles in AI and this helps her understand the tech (and its limitations) better as well as apply to more jobs easier&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Market is brutal though man. She hasnt gotten an offer after so much trying&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building https://www.hessra.net/, an authorization system based on the Biscuit token format (decentralized, signed, and attenuable). The goal is to push beyond JWTs and Zanzibar-style policy engines by giving every machine-to-machine request its own embedded, verifiable authorization logic in a small capability token. These tokens can be delegated, restricted, and verified locally with no extra network calls required after getting the token.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early use case is replacing API keys with identity tokens that expire, delegate, and prove possession and then can be used for easy step up to fine-grained authorization. There's some pretty interesting authorization stuff you can do, like having multiple parties sign off before a token is valid or requiring a series of micro-services sign a token for it to be valid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I rewrote Playwright to run completely in a Chrome Extension without CDP or chrome.devtools for no practical reason at all. I started to do it like Forest Gump started running. It can't get past bot protection so pretty worthless from a browser automation point of view. [0]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I don't understand is why the need to rewrite Playwright instead of just patching it. Playwright (or Puppeteer) has addressed every edge case that has come -- especially race conditions which are a monster to deal with -- up over the years and by the time you do the same you will have Playwright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is rewriting or rebuilding Playwright from the ground up needed?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very cool. I make a consulting business out of packaging selenium scripts into windows apps for small businesses, do you have any desire to turn this into a saleable product?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stagehand is our open source project, but the company behind it is called Browserbase - https://browserbase.com/ where we run headless browser infrastructure as a service. So no interest at this point, Browserbase drives the revenue that funds Stagehand!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LINOG.ph is a live earthquake tracker for the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Philippines deals with thousands of earthquakes a year. Whenever the government volcanology and seismology department detects earthquakes, they post it on their official website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a major earthquake happens, a huge number of people try to visit the site, causing downtime for up to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LINOG.ph caches earthquake data from the official government website and the U.S. Geological Survey site, and makes them highly available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built this after seeing friends and family donating and providing support for affected families after a major earthquake in Cebu. This was my way of helping out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two super typhoons have hit the Philippines in the past two weeks, so I'm also considering adding in typhoon tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a small embedded vector database lib (à la SQLite). Just finalized the file format, it works pretty great so far. Besides, it’s an excuse to learn rust and low level programming in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm making an app for self-tracking. Combining elements from habit trackers, health logging and journaling. Built for rich customization and local-first. Want to be free of rigid structures of many existing apps while providing a better UX / usability than using a spreadhsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://gametje.com (a Jackbox games competitor). Been working on the Android TV app lately. Will probably start creating a new game next week with acronyms similar to the old game Acrophobia from the late 90s/early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really liked the concept of games like cards against humanity, quiplash, whose line is it anyway etc. However, there was no virtual way to play it with a group of friends. Quiplash required steam setup (which was not possible on my corporate mac). So i built this as an alternate to build upon the formula.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on Spine AI, a visual workspace to think across multiple AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can chat, branch, and connect 300+ models on an infinite canvas: useful when you need to explore tradeoffs, check blind spots, or generate assets (research, slides, prompts, images) from the same board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I've been building a health tracking app called LogBuddy. I got tired of using separate apps for nutrition, workouts, weight, and period tracking. So I built LogBuddy to handle all of it with a dead simple interface. That way, all the heath data I'm tracking would be in one place. Right now there's an Android APK available. If there's interest, I'll publish to the Play Store and build an iOS version too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear your feedback if you try it out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experimenting with various AI models via GitHub Co-Pilot on an extremely niche project to see how far these models have progressed. Used like ~60% of the premium quota to develop the following projects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manual audio splitting tool for the above project: audio-splitter-6b3.pages.dev/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've always been skeptical of AI-generated code. This is my first experiment with AI agents, where the full code base, implementation, debugging, and deployment are done using AI Agents MCPs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Used VS Code all the way, i.e., all the source codes, including the code to generate the Google Play Store APK. I only reviewed the source code before committing and helped debug by suggesting ideas/algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mostly used Claude Haiku 4.5 like 75% of the time, where it failed, switched to the sonnet 4.5 or GPT 5 codex. Interestingly, when debugging, sometimes one model struggled even after numerous iterations/feedback loops, but then the problem was solved instantly as soon as I switched to another model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought the audio splitting could be done automatically using some AI models from Hugging Face or Whisper. But the audio files have some complex repetitions; the output was miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for now, this splitting is done manually using a Web UI (The audio splitting tool splits the large audio files into multiple small audio files, think of it like a long paragraph is split into multiple sentences.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will attempt again to automate this splitting task using AI, after drafting a game plan for tackling the challenges. I'm thinking of using energy drops and other similar factors to create segments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still working on WithAudio (https://desktop.with.audio). A one time payment Text To Speech Desktop App. Because I think everything doesn't have to be a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October I finished the PDF parser. It was a big challenge extracting PDF contect with correct paragraph breaks on user's computer locally. I'm gonna write about this soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I'm working on a web extension that talks to the app that run locally on your system so you can use WithAudio in your browser with very good performance, 100% local and private.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kinda gave up on building apps for Rocknix (since there is no easy way to distribute software) and instead have been looking at my apple watch. I ported over some software for workouts that is streamlined. I'm working on a way with MDNS to sync data to my Linux PC automatically when I'm at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it works out, maybe this could be a way for me to replace the compromised Apple Music app with something that actually syncs to my music on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disenhackifying one of the last pieces of my KaithemAutomation server that still feels not best practicesful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Device driver plugins used to have a very simple flat key value, strings only format, with a set_config_properties function to tell the host what kind of UI to show.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's all getting replaced with JSON schemas, with some auto-upgrade shims so old config keeps working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's one of many things that now seems completely insane, but made sense when I had way less experience a long time ago!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also still on and off working on my BLE/WiFi based Meshtastic-alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://NitroQR.com Building the one stop QR Generator with a crazy amount of aesthetic customizability. Already at a pretty functional level, focusing on marketing now. Got something new cooking for the holiday season. Hopefully launching this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on marketing my dedicated game server host https://stratos.host - it's a simplified product compared to traditional companies, using a desktop app to detect games being launched.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have made a co-op roguelite tower defense game inspired by the old Warcraft III maps. A major inspiration was YouTD. You can play it here: https://defense-of-solaris.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I posted in this monthly thread first time in May when I launched a daily logic puzzle, Clues by Sam. Since then it's grown significantly, and I couldn't be happier!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game has a farily simple frontend, but there is a fairly complex constraint solving algorithm as part of the puzzle making process. What makes the puzzle quite unique is that you can't "guess". You can only make guesses that are provable by logic. The algorithm ensuring this has worked flawlessly for months now (though I've manually inserted some silly mistakes once or twice).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today's puzzle is one of the hardest to date. The difficulty resets on Mondays, and then gets harder again towards Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This helped me bridge the gap between installing packages declaratively via NixOS / home-manager and defining them for each project being worked in via flake.nix / direnv / nix-direnv; which was needed since most projects don't use Nix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Porting LevelDB[1] to Seastar[2], for internal metadata storage in Redpanda[3]. Before you ask why can’t something off the shelf be used, seastar has unique constraints around its runtime and its memory allocator that means we can’t reuse an existing library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a chrome extension (with over 600,000 downloads) that lets you chat with page, draft emails and messages, fix grammar, translate, summarize page, etc.. You can use models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on methods to automate my VC firm. We have a small team and many different tasks to do. I’ve had success with using LLMs to help us automate various projects. But I appreciate any open source tools, techniques, readings, etc. if anyone knows any!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've been tinkering with building realtime talking head models (avatar models, etc.) for a while now, and finally have something that works (well enough)! Operates at ~2x realtime on a 4090, significantly faster than that on enterprise grade GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main use case we designed for was language learning, particularly having a conversational partner -- generally we've found that adding a face to the voice really helps trigger the fight or flight response, which we've found to be the hardest part of speaking a new language with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in building out the system around the model to enable that use case (tool use on a canvas for speaking prompts and images, memory to make conversations less stale, etc.), we think there's potential for other use cases too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GunStopperDrone Game Single player game, race against the clock to defuse a dangerous situation using a drone against an armed attacker. https://game.gunstopperdrone.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a video / post on how to solve the 1 billion row challenge (https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) and get a competitively fast result while keeping the code readable and maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far I'm within spitting distance of the winning entries without using any unsafe code or bit twiddling tricks or custom JVMs or anything like that, and having all the concerns nicely separated and modularized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building a foundational layer for building C++ apps using Bazel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on creating a standardized set of paths and third party libraries that work seamlessly across multiple developer teams. Allowing library upgrades to happen transparently in the background. This will enable developers to focus on business specific logic and not have to worry about the intricacies of the build system and allowing to "magically" work in the background. This is allow foray into Bazel and using it as a learning exercise to master it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I finally started modding a total war game (Warhammer 3). I played the series since the very first title, Shogun and I always wanted to improve the control over units and add my custom AI to not micromanage everything, but assumed it would be too time consuming and distracting from my main work. And well, it likely would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But thanks to LLMs, I finally decided to give it a go and got something basic working in a short time, hurrey for AI assisted coding!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feels empowering to be honest. No idea if I will really implement the main ideas, that I have since a long time, but I know that I can now if I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building vet. The goal is to automate open source package vetting beyond just CVE but actually identify code capabilities, malicious code and other security sensitive attributes through code analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://outcrop.app, a knowledge base for software teams with instant search, realtime collaboration, and LLM-driven workflows. It's built using Rust and friends. I'm looking for more early testers! :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a browser plugin that lets you edit Supabase database tables just like Excel, until it's ready. Then you switch to the main branch and the tables will be read only&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Local-first app for comparing hardware builds, down to the individual component feature level: specs, benchmarks, even cpu extension support, lanes, how many speakers in X laptop, dolby atmos? screen panel manufacturer(s), etc. Basically, no-nonsense real product comparison for transparent and fast decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm going all in on my side project CodeBrew, a Java IDE for iPad. Currently working on OpenGL support for 3d graphics, as some schools requested the feature. Also I'm finally pitting some work into aquisition, which has turned out to be much more fun than I anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go check it out, its free to try, with a one-time purchase full version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correct and performant way to calculate historical value of a portfolio. I want a pure function, but taking a date as input is insufficient because users can edit holdings, and securities can split.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weighing the tradeoffs of doing this calculation server or client side. That'll be an architecture shift away from my current set of background jobs fetching state and towards something more functional and on-demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonoverse[1], an iOS puzzle game about nonograms (image logic puzzles).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far all levels have been handmade pixel art. I’m now testing machine generated puzzles with random “pixels”. This is an interesting challenge because I still want levels to be solvable and fun. I recently released 15 new puzzles like this and I’m preparing a new update with more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Mac-based video manager that automatically transcribes, translates and summarises videos. I process information best through reading, so I built it to manage my growing collection of training course videos, webinars and meeting recordings. Currently working on adding RAG search to make it easier to query content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also building a CMS and static site generator that runs entirely client side in the browser. Pick themes, model content an publish to clean HTML. It also makes content available beyond just the browser, eg in a command line TUI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On and off working on the Navigation API for Node, Bun, Deno, &amp;amp; as a browser polyfill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Has 90% test coverage, makes use of web platform tests to verify compatibility, and is in use by some larger companies already with the Navigation API soon to become a baseline in evergreen browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Navigation API effectively is async state navigations. The likes of React has recently added Navigation API support to make use of the browser reload indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on PocketWise (https://pocketwise.app) a lightweight personal finance tracking app. Goal is to make double entry accounting simple and approachable for everyday use. It’s my first project of this kind, so I’d really appreciate any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I write almost daily article about libGDX - my most favorite code-centric game framework. There are now over 100 articles covering topics from basics to advances. I plan to post more because this is more or less a passionate project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the future I hope it evolves into a definitive resource for learning game development with Java and libGDX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building https://ottex.ai - a native MacOS app to solve repetitive micro tasks on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Transcribe voice to text (especially useful when you need to explain something to Claude code )&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- (soon) select text to instantly Check grammar / Improve writing / change tone of text&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- (soon) select text to Translate between languages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I discovered that I have a few 10/20$ subscriptions (grammarly, raycast, wisperflow) that do embarrassingly simple stuff I can one shot with cheap SLM. So I decided to build a one app specialized in small repetitive tasks on computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Intent is a self-contained document that describes a user request. It is composed of three main sections: WHY (the motivation), WHAT (the requirements, often in Gherkin language), and HOW (a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan defined with tasks). This approach ensures clarity and alignment before any code is written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knocker, an http knock based access service for your homelab that works at a reverse proxy or firewall level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a more convenient albeit less secure alternative to VPNs like tailscale. It's more convenient because it whitelists the enite network, and it's less secure for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's really cool, but as far as I know there's no complete C++ implementation for embedded platforms, and I still can't figure out how it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does the gossip flooding mean every single node needs to know about every other node in the entire mesh?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a project vaguely inspired by this and Meshtastic that tries to make use of existing internet tech, while falling back to local links, instead of trying to replace the Internet completely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's very much WIP, I'm planning to get rid of all of the automatic reliable retransmit stuff and replace it with per channel end to end acknowledgment. https://github.com/EternityForest/LazyMesh#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there any kind of DHT like routing for the addresses? Woudn't the announces make a lot of traffic without that, if you ever got to thousands of nodes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;working on https://careroute.ai - triages people to right site of care, estimates their visit cost with their insurance before they go, and lowers bills after visit by having an AI voice agent negotiate on their behalf. Triage works for all regions, cost estimates and bill negotiation is US-only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a boardgame with the help of AI. It's way too easy to create placeholder art with an n8n pipeline, but GPT-5 regularly fails at writing and debugging LaTeX which I'm using for all of the card creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, TikZ is often outside the ability of GPT5 to successfully write or debug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Made a website to host a blog! Right now it's empty except for one post describing the process of setting up the blog. I plan to add more stuff once I finish this semester in college.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built https://forvard.org/ with Tauri + Svelte; Forvard is a accomplishment tracker where your data lives locally (think of Obsidian but for career tracking), it has a bit of smartness to summarize your accomplishments (without sending your data over the network). I'm working on fixing bugs and adding couple of features!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on adding Apple Intelligence to my macOS app built to analyze iOS app size metrics. I'm hoping to have a locally running assistant that can act like an iOS build engineer to provide optimization opportunities and more: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dotipa/id6742254881.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now my app allows users to export build metadata as JSON which can be interpreted by LLMs for analysis, but I'd like to have this work on-device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a typed, array-oriented dataflow compiler that takes small declarative schemas and emits plain Ruby and JavaScript, with a C path. It has a mid-end with inlining, common subexpression elimination, constant folding, dead code elimination, loop fusion, and LICM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a script for a product demo or tutorial for your app using an extension. The script is used to generate your product content in multiple formats (narrated video, interactive demo, looping animation, and in-app guide). Whenever your product changes, just update the script and regenerate everything. No manual re-recording of video, syncing of audio, or any other post-production steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! I built a site that shows your next age milestones, all on a single page. You can see your next milestone age for each type (like your 10000th day) and save it to Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks simple, but I learned a lot building this site:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* To calculate age in planetary years, I had to look up their orbit and rotation info&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* The lunisolar calendar took me quite some time to figure out (it is not the same as a lunar calendar and even changes by country)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Adding the dog and cat age equivalents even led me to cubic splines&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a web app that creates easy-to-understand stories and explainers for the sake of language learning. You can listen in your favourite podcast app, or directly on the website with illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the testing so far is English/French/Japanese/Mandarin, but I'm eager to add more languages if anyone is fluent and willing to help me evaluate the text-to-speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a fork of Alt+Tab replacement Switcheroo to show all available windows in a tabular format. Current windows in the center. Apps with many windows on the left sorted by process name (e.g. Excel or PDF windows). Pinned windows such as open emails on the right. https://github.com/coezbek/switcheroo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a _boring_ business - a CRM for pilates and yoga studios (https://www.usemojo.app/en). Most tools in this space are bloated or built for gyms, not for someone juggling reformer classes, cancellations, and back-to-back privates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started when a friend who runs a studio showed me her system: printed calendars, WhatsApp messages from clients at midnight, and sticky notes for who paid. I'm trying to make something quieter. It should feel like an assistant, not another tool to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scratching my own (and my employer's, but they don't know that) itch and building a knowledge management system as a nerdy way of spending evenings. I refused to learn JS for years, but turns out it's not as bad as I thought, and TS makes it really nice, plus I like (to my surprise) SolidJS' JSX interpretation quite a lot. Half vibe-coded, half breaking things and learning a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://github.com/s1liconcow/skyshelve - persistent python dictionary on S3. Used this to create a durable execution layer to do some of the analytics for the above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A multiplayer game prototype, written in Rust, using Bevy + egui for graphics. Think of it as a bare bones implementation of a game like Runescape, mostly to test out current LLM capability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't found much value in LLMs for coding beyond very self contained tasks, but some people speak highly of it, and I want to be sure that I'm not missing out. So from time to time I give new tools a try. This time is "Claude Code on the web".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've put in an estimated 50 hours so far. It has a client and an authoritative server. The client displays 3D graphics with some placeholder models. From the client, you can click on tiles and move to them, or click on enemies to pathfind and attack them. You can right-click on tiles or monsters to open a menu with options (attack, trade, move). There are some unit tests and a few integration tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now the issues that Claude has been unable to resolve after a few attempts are: * Attack animations. I'm trying to get it to raise and then lower a rectangular block to simulate a sword attack. It really doesn't get it, and it's harder to write tests for compared to movement and server-client networking. * "Entity interpolation". Rather walking entities instantly moving from tile to tile, movement should flow smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have Claude Pro ($20/mo) which let me make a few commits per day. After a few days of that, Anthropic offered $250 in credits to promote "Claude Code on the web". The credits expire after two weeks. I'm now five days into that period and have gone through $50 in credits. It is heavily rate limited and frequently locks me out for multiple hours after only a few interactions, but it's free credits so I can't really complain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People use Puter for an incredibly wide range of things, including cloud storage, web hosting, coding, AI, and gaming. Right now, we're mostly focused on improving performance and making sure that it's as fast as a regular desktop environment!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks fun! But the fact that the self hosted version lacks support for some core apps is sad, I'd love to be able to build puter apps! Any plans for an app store-like ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm adding an overly elaborate item and levelling up system to the adventure mode of my chess variant AI sandbox: www.chesscraft.ca&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Items have a prefix and suffix system similar to Diablo 2 so I'm having nostalgic fun building it. None of this gives any advantage to the chess games you play. It's just a pointless cycle of gems, items, and experience to get more gems, items and experience. Seems fun so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a command-line tool for advanced full-text search of written documents. It works in a completely different way than grep, so it can do a lot of operations that grep fundamentally cannot like proximity searching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I called it Wosp for word-oriented search and print. I released the first functional version a few days ago: https://github.com/atrettel/wosp&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional accounting platforms we expose the ledger model directly which enables our customers to model complex transactions even when we do not have direct support for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been working on this for a month, and it uses Elixir, Phoenix and InertiaJS with React.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been a fun 3 year project. Just launched on iOS and am in user acquisition phase. Totally new learnings here! Getting users is definitely the hard part... I can build something all day&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New (open source) PostgreSQL index type for analytics workloads, which is a read-only drop-in replacement for B-trees. Smol is multiplicatively faster than B-Trees and radically smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a Yelp alternative called Vibehuntr -- just something different to browse venues using Google's API, with a social layer so I can see what my friends like. It's very rough around the edges right now and it might be completely different by next week. It's been a fun experiment in vibe coding on a full stack. https://vibehuntr.io&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I an working on a Builtwith alternative called Bloomberry that will help sales teams enrich their leads in Clay with real-time technographic sales intelligence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the philosophy of selling shovels in a gold rush, I have built a Markdown Viewer for Mac which is optimised for AI coding with the likes of Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is simple but powerful supporting all formatting but also diagrams so you can get Claude to generate beautiful ER, or state-transition diagrams for your documentation. It also supports math notation, file links and has a cool table of contents feature&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://teeming.ai, trying to solve the information asymmetry problem in the job market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project has been a huge learning curve for me - I started out as a skeptic of how generative AI could solve real problems (rather than just create noise) but now think that, like the internet, it can create a new kind of abundance that will be harnessable in all sorts of interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on secure file intake for Intercom. Recently spoke to a customer and turns out file intake is just a part of the bigger story, currently thinking about processing files, e-signature, client portals and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on my own code review app powered by local or self hosted LLMs. It started as a way to lint my own code and took off from there. It's basically like greptile or co-pilot, but has some things that they don't:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a scraper in Golang based on Colly to do two things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Automatically train the scraper on the structure of the page to acquire the data you want, and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Clean and structure the data into a format suitable to go into a relational database&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got sick of doing all that manually for some pricing data I wanted to monitor on some suppliers sites, and I've always wanted to contribute more to open source and give back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eyeball is a bookmarks app that turns your own saved links into hyper-personalized playlists. It's like having a personal curator in your pocket that sends you a weekly issue of your own personal "magazine" on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have found that duplicated tabs can be useful e.g. for pages where footnotes are not hyperlinked in the text. When this happens I open a duplicate tab and scroll to the bottom of the page on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;oh, for sure, that's why the extension shows which tabs are duplicated, and I can kill the duplicates individually, but also has a kill-all-duplicates button&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A database populated with audio metadata (including a link back to YouTube or Spotify or whatever) that includes vector embeddings for the audio. That way I can grab clips of music I like from YouTube, generate vectors for them, then find similar things in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's off to a rocky start though, as I've initially populated it with YouTube-8M and AudioSet, neither of which are music-specific. The search results can be... Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A FLAC encoder/decoder written in Guile scheme. I struggled to get the decoder working with most test files for a while until recently. It's more or less a fully functional decoder now. It's also 1:1 with the reference meta-flac command currently as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created this recently but have let it fallow in the last month. Planning to update it over the next few days / weeks. There are a crazy number of directions I could take it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiplayer QWOP-like where you control one leg of an octopus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm further ahead in the development than shown here, hopefully have the finished thing out with support for multiple games within a month or so (would be faster if I didn't have a job lol)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some years ago, I co-founded a startup that would run workflows when email messages arrived, any email from any source was parsed and it would trigger "actions" that could include notifications - this sounds like a good use case for it! You don't need the service to expose an api to listen in, since most services end up sending email as last fallback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;building a location-based game that captures Taiwan's absurd convenience stores density[1]. Players stand at any 7-11/FamilyMart/etc, take a photo showing you can see the next store, walk to it, repeat. Chain as many stores together as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It sounds silly but Taiwan really is this convenient - you often can see 2-3 stores from one spot. Here[2] one route where you can actually link 7 convenience stores in a row! Now trying to make maps look a bit nicer with mapbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World model for AI agents. Doing process mining of missions, operations and logistics to transform them into digital twins. AI agents can then leverage these digital twins as world models for control or prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Travi, an AI-powered travel companion that helps travelers effortlessly discover the best attractions to check out based on their interests, and experience them through rich, immersive audio narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A filmmaker community for those wanting to showcase their work. Right now everyone's got their own squarespace and the problem is that about 0 filmmakers also want to be web masters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically working on our FinOps agent which can identify and remediate cloud infa cost related issues across AWS, Azure, Datadog, etc. The agent lives in Slack and surfaces cost savings initiatives for teams to inspect and approve for the agent to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the intermediate level lots of learners struggle to find suitable content that matches their level and interests, more than a few learners turn to notebookLM podcasts to provide that, but that's a bit of a hassle to set up. So I built a platform that generates and manages infinite and shareable streams around your interests or specific vocabulary. It also provides live interactive transcripts (karaoke / teleprompter style) if you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Core features work but still rough around the edges. Happy to help you out with any issues you encounter, languages to add, feature requests etc...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An LLM-powered 'offline' journaling/mindfulness app that draws on ancient philosophy. Designed it initially to help nudge my own habit along &amp;amp; keep things fresh/interesting every time I sat down for a scribble-sesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a cursor style ai agent but for planning hikes/trips. It does context management and tool calls into data sources and navigates the world to find interesting places. Should be getting out of private beta this week! https://wanderfugl.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://ziva.sh/, an AI agent for game development. It uses MCP to integrate with Godot, a leading open source game engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's coming together really nicely, targeting a beta release later this month. If anyone is interested in game development and wants to be a beta tester, lmk :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ups = some local-area doulas have started sharing the baby app in a big WhatsApp group &amp;amp; growth is starting to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downs = my first vibe-coding horror story. For PracticeCallAI, the subscription flow was failing and somehow outside my test coverage, so I've been missing out on new subscribers for the last two months. In an effort fix it, Replit Agent - which I have been loving otherwise - truncated the table that stores all of the user calls. and their database rollback is throwing errors. So that's been fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on AI business coach that can help you at different stages of your startup or small business journey. Here is where you can access the business coach: https://ceo.getbeyondx.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a set of experiments that explores LLMs visual understanding of your photos to learn about you, especially given the recent learnings from deepseek-OCR. Part of the experiments delve into storing the memories with GraphRAG so they can be effectively retrieved without losing too information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi HN, we’re a Milan-based fintech startup developing FELKO, an AI-powered data platform that helps banks and credit-holders standardize, monitor and act on debt portfolios in partnership with collection agencies!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;system to test and calibrate an analog traction control system. the system uses a frequency to voltage converter and a bunch of opamps to compare wheel speeds then determines wheel slip or slide and either reduces engine power or braking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Test system uses ADCs, DACs and a DDS to produce a sine wave that simulates wheel speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to make it easier to just quickly enable wake lock on your device in a cross platform, no install, offline capable way. It's a silly little project but I'm super proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new web server written and server management dashboard in JavaScript that is much faster and less complicated than either Apache or NGINX and serves HTTP and WebSockets from the same port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cpp code generator like esphome, to generate the firmware for midi devices in a simple yaml file, for raspberry Pico.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would have been so much easy just to program the midi hub I wanted to program but wanted to make it generic.. now I can make the firmware for any configuration in seconds!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a Firefox, Chrome, VSCode and OpenVSX security scanner and profiler, and working on building a private web store for Enterprises to switch to rather than using the default stores given all the ransomware and malware activity in that space. Will show HN very soon!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a pretty complicated set of GNU Makefiles for a simulation library at work, but was annoyed I had to work so hard to avoid collisions, so I'm working on a "more sanitary" build-your-own-build-system/build-system-kernel type deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My latest is Marvelogs (https://www.marvelogs.com) - always wanted to build a price tracker (or tracking any values on a regular basis) - it's nearly there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No projects at the moment. Just working on myself and improving some things in my life, job, cheaper place to rent, lose weight etc. Dreaming of starting a business, I just want to add a cool service to my local city but the economics is hard&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A non-bloated HTML, CSS and pure Vanilla JS framework to create dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cross-platform JSONL viewer where I am learning ImGUI. Haven’t found any other open source GUI framework that‘s small, provides out of the box components for tables, sorting&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evals for programming languages with formal verification. It's not clear how far we are from good coding performance in less popular languages in general, and formal verification has some quirks on top also.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a web app that doctors/NPs/PAs can use to automatically rewrite complicated and verbose medical progress notes. The amount of time medical providers spend on documentation is ballooning, and only a small portion that time is actually spent doing medical decision making. The rest of the time is spent incorporating (ie copy editing) data as it comes in from imaging/bloodwork/consultant advice. The goal is for the app to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;entirely self service, without needing EHR integrations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;able to persist and reuse the user's writing style, without actually saving any of the notes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just got a 3d printer (Bambu a1 mini) and my girlfriend brought home a whole bag of plant cuttings. Thought I would give a modular plant pot (i.e with elements that allow for expanding the pot) in fusion 360 a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been nerd sniped recently so am working on a Rust version of markdownlint-cli2. I'm tired of having a node dependency in my projects and this seems like a constrained enough problem space that I'll actually get around to doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on MedAngle, the world's first agentic AI Super App for current and future doctors. Invite only, 100k+ users, 150m+ questions solved, tens of billions of seconds spent studying smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a honeypot system that uses AI to mess with attackers. When someone tries to hack your app, it detects them and serves up fake responses based on attack type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system learns from attackers behavior and creates convincing decoys to waste their time and frustrate their efforts. It's basically a trap that gets smarter the more attackers poke at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moved from nodered only to a hybrid of nodered and home assistant. Added some new sensors, nfc tags, modes and automations for multiple tenants / cost savings. Its been fun to automate some boring tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is anyone working on or knows a library for evaluating LLMs for application features and/or application features that use LLMs? I am wondering what people use or if anyone has their own solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A template-based automation tool for small private equity firms. It has some AI functionality as well to easily parse documents and information from transcripts. Basically I want to free up investment teams from admin tasks so that they can spend more time on evaluating deals and building relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of the AI-powered applications for private equity firms are focusing on the multi-billion dollar firms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predict? Interesting!! How do you plan to do that? We have an API if you need one. We recently launched https://bestkundli.com, which does the prediction thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm personally tired of getting stuck in config/deployment hell every time I want to deploy a long-lived web service. Sure I eventually learned how to use systemd, but systemd has SO many things baked into that I simply don't need. systemg is a lightweight process supervisor that features everything you'd typically want when running/managing production web services in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on some writing on my blog [1], trying to improve my writing and explore style.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My current series of post follows the surge of interest in UUIDs with the uptake of UUIDv7. I've seen some subtle misunderstandings spreading, so I dive into nuance. This has spun off some mini projects, like an RFC compliant UUIDv8 implementation based on XKCD 221 [2] (humor intended). I think I have two more in the blog series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to relearn Rust by writing a download manager CLI. Managed to get the blocking version working, now I've implemented the async version using tokio. Have to next implement downloading chunks with different workers, and a download queue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve recently written ImapGoose, a daemon which keeps a remote IMAP mailbox in sync with a local tree of Maildir: https://whynothugo.nl/tags/imapgoose/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It relies on “modern” (2009) extensions to minimise traffic and avoids polling entirely (relying on the server to notify of new messages or changes as they happen).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s currently quite stable. The only known issue is that it can take a while to detect a timeout when the system is suspended and woken up again (there’s no portable API to detect suspend/resume).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve been working on a simple TUI email client based on notmuch and maildir. So far it works really well for processing email, but lacks any capabilities for handling attachments, composing, sending (these are obviously on the roadmap).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh I'm super curious about your notmuch project. I've been wanting an email client that's just a tui on top of notmuch. Wonder if we can pair up? Ill ping you over email&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building a coding agent for small businesses. The agent runs on Linux box on own cloud. Desktop and mobile apps to chat with AI models and generate software as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH based access with HTTP port forward. Team collaboration, multiple models, git based workflow, test deployment automation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just finished a little webtoy. It's like a comic strip time machine - you can see a virtual newspaper comics page for any date in the last seventy years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V happy with how the CSS came out, except I spent a lot of time on an "ink bleed" newsprint effect that (oops) only looks good on HiDPI monitors... lessons learned I suppose&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was able to get the original 15khz CRT monitor up and running by recapping the board. I decided that the control panel was unsalvageable, and insufficient for what I wanted to do, which was make this cabinet compatible with most any game that would have run on a cab like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided to use RGB lit buttons, so I could change the color's depended on which game was loaded. I used an ESP-32s2 to emulate a keyboard, and accept serial messages from the host computer that changes the button colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also incorporated a Stream Deck in the control panel for auxiliary functions. I was able to write a node application to run the stream deck (with the help of a library) since there is no OEM software for linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By far the most challenging part was getting a suitable signal to the CRT. The first thing I tried was using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins through a VGA666 board, but this limited my colors to 16bit, which makes 3d games look pretty awful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next I tried using a downscaler. This got me 24 bit color, but resolution switching doesn't work with this method.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying an AMD system now. Apparently the linux driver lets you set custom resolutions, and output 15khz (and 25khz for that matter) right from the VGA port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plan on doing a writeup after I near completion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I buy and operate e-commerce brands that sell on Amazon, and I'm working on handing as much of the operation of the business off to AI as possible. Doing this both for actual time savings for myself and also as my big-picture eval of new AI models + products as they come out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also started a Substack to document it - here's a recent post on using Gemini to screen inbound emails with prospective acquisition targets via a Google Apps Script that evaluates the listings in those emails daily: https://theautomatedoperator.substack.com/p/screening-inboun....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahhh this is exactly what I'm looking for! I don't see any pricing on any pages. Would love to know how much this costs (I don't know what 455 diamonds is worth) as there's a few sprites that I'd love to animate and use in my app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a fan of signing up before seeing how much I'd have to pay. The examples look great though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prices are about to drop dramatically. Many of the models dropped &amp;gt;80% in price since initial launch. Any time I have a reduction in cost, I pass the savings directly on to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not sure if you just added this in or I overlooked it, but exactly the kind of transparency I love. Will give this a try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDIT - Did an image generation using the OpenAI 4o model, then ran through the lowest quality animation. This is awesome and first pass is very strong and usable (around 100 diamonds used).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing prices drop more and the asset pack area fill up. Keep going man, really awesome stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently added FSRS (besides also having Anki integration). Now I'm working on replacing the need for reviewing flashcards by having reading activity automatically mark flashcards (current and future) as reviewed, so that you can get many of your reviews in just by reading native materials that interest you instead of sacrificing most of your study time to contextless flashcard grind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also working on a manga mode using a new manga OCR tech I have licensed out of academia that is ahead of state of the art alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's native SwiftUI and Swift so I want to avoid a rewrite. I am experimenting with porting my Swift code to web via WASM, now that SQLite WASM backed by IndexedDB is usable so I can reuse the data layer too. I'm also evaluating https://skip.tools for running my SwiftUI on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks super cool. I love to see people working on language learning tech. I'm working on a language learning app too but it only really works well for indo-european languages. That said I would still love to collab or talk shop, my contact info is in my bio&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're into movies or filmmaking, it's a fantastic AI tool for consistent, fully-intentional scenes with deliberate set and actor blocking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also the cheapest model aggregator service out there. You can log into every AI image and video provider directly and don't have to pay me anything to use the tool. You can use your Sora account, Midjourney account, Grok account, etc. It'll soon let you log into other aggregators like OpenArt, plug in your FAL API key, etc. so you can use your credits/funds wherever they happen to live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike the other "model aggregator" websites like Higgsfield, this is a desktop app written in Rust that you can keep. It also has highly intentional 2D and 3D design surfaces especially built for design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text prompting sucks for artists and designers, so I'm trying to put image and video design onto canvases that you can intuitively mold like clay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Added compression to my metal 3D printer slicer exported CAM files, and refactored the code to better support larger volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tweaking the piezoelectric driver PCB design for the micro-positing microscopy stage project. The Nanomotion piezoelectric motors were not meant to be used in the manner I chose, but it is fun to push the limits of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finishing up some custom 1U mounted hardware, and getting a batch of test PCB soon. Bend radius came back 1mm oversize, but this was acceptable for a single run item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also involved in several other projects maybe 3 people would care about. Doing a custom FPGA PCB is not very fun unless encountering that rare class of problem CPU/MCU simply can't handle cleanly. =3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But of course the programmer in me needs to make my own software to design patterns with code. Enjoying using paper.js to do all the complicated math to calculate lengths and angles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All-in-one router/nas/firewall/adblock/app server (each piece optional)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Declarative and reproduceable as it is built off of NixOS, but administered through a UI, so the user doesn't have to know this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All state managed in a backup bundle, so it can be hosted at home or in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goal is to have a box you plug just like a wifi access point into your modem, follow a simple web-based installation flow, then you are running a personal cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Website is self-hosted by HomeFree, but installation instructions are very out of date, which I'm working on right now. There are now installation ISOs that I will soon add a link to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been building SageNet, a voice-first AI coach that turns your goals into structured, adaptive learning plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a 2-minute voice conversation, Sage generates a personalized 6-module roadmap with build-first projects. It checks in by voice, analyzes your reflections, and regenerates your plan if needed. You can invite friends to your Support Squad for accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest insight so far is people don’t want “infinite content.” They want structure and someone who remembers them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In network code: most people just let the OS choose a default adapter. It works fine, but it makes it hard to write software that works across machines with either (1) multiple NICs (and/or networks they point to.) or (2) multiple external Internet IPs. Look at STUN, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A STUN server that lets people test what type of NAT they have uses two IPs. For such a server you have to manually specify the addresses to bind on to make for sure its setup right. As it goes, writing network software to do simple things like "bind on all local addresses", "bind publicly", "bind on all", is harder than it sounds. There are edge cases on different OSes and address families, so manually managing IPs is hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My network software lets devs easily manage NICs and routes they support without guessing about addressing. Additionally, I've written a bunch of software with the library already to do things like NAT traversal. So its really my own redesign of how to do networking on the Internet. Designed to hide a lot of the messiness. I'm still improving code quality so it's not ready yet. But I've been dog fooding with a lot of software written in it and smashing bugs every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fun have been creating a mashup of old school DnD map generation using Commodore "10 Print Chr$(205.5+Rnd(1)); : Goto 10" style logic (in TS/Svelte/SVG):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have been down a rabbit hole ensuring the stairs are realistic and that grid connects properly. Lots of fun and frustration with AI coding tools trying to solve that (they mostly don't/can't). Some fun detours learning a little Prolog to help out as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ELO translated to the NFL with margin-of-victory adjustments, a modest home-field term, and week-to-week recency weighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Post-hoc calibration with isotonic regression so 70% predictions land near 0.70 empirically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monte Carlo to roll games forward for distributions on weekly win odds and season outcomes, plus basic reliability/Brier/log-loss tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;# Where I’m taking it (ensemble ideas)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blend a few complementary signals: (1) pure ELO strength; (2) schedule-adjusted EPA/Success Rate features; (3) injury/QB continuity and rest/travel effects; (4) a small “market prior” from closing lines; (5) weather/play style pace features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combine via a simple stacked model (regularized logistic, isotonic on top), or a Bayesian hierarchical model that lets team effects evolve with partial pooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separate models for win prob vs. expected margin, then reconcile with a consistent link so the two don’t disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emphasis on calibration over leaderboard-chasing: reliability diagrams, ECE, PIT histograms, and backtests that penalize regime drift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;# Why I’m doing it&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a sandbox to teach myself Monte Carlo and ELO end-to-end—data ingest → feature plumbing → simulation → calibration → eval—on a domain with immediate feedback every week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;# How this connects to my day job (healthcare ops)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I work at BlueSprig, running ~150 ABA therapy clinics. I’m exploring whether ELO-like ideas can augment ops decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Strength” ratings for clinics, care teams, or scheduling templates based on outcome deltas and throughput (margin-of-victory ≈ effect size/efficiency).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monte Carlo for expansion planning (new-site ramp curves), capacity/OT forecasting, and risk-adjusted outcome monitoring with calibration so probabilities mean something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guardrails for fairness and interpretability so ratings don’t become blunt scorecards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;# Help&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve shipped calibrated ensembles in sports or have pointers on applying rating systems to multi-site healthcare operations, I’d love to trade notes or if you need someone to this and other kind of work for their dayjob email me at mgracepellon@gmail.com -- I would love to do this fulltime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that I am trying to narrow down a bug in my backend which sometimes causes it to crash. Since backend is built in Swift using SQLite as database, it's a bit hard to nail down the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And an iOS expense tracker focused for frequent travelers, and macOS photos viewer based on the filesystem instead of a monolithic opaque "library", 2 needs that I had since forever but could never get through Apple's atrocious developer documentation far enough to finish making them :')&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How the UK Lost Its Shipbuilding Industry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From roughly the end of the US Civil War until the late 1950s, the United Kingdom was one of the biggest shipbuilders in the world. By the 1890s, UK shipbuilders were delivering 80% of worldwide shipping tonnage, and though the country only briefly maintained this market-dominating level of output— on the eve of World War I, its share of the market had fallen to 60% — it nonetheless remained one of the world’s largest shipbuilders for the next several decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the end of WWII, UK shipbuilding appeared ascendant. The shipbuilding industries of most other countries had been devastated by the war (or were, like Japan, prevented from building new ships), and in the immediate years after the war the UK built more ship tonnage than the rest of the world combined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this success was short-lived. The UK ultimately proved unable to respond to competitors who entered the market with new, large shipyards which employed novel methods of shipbuilding developed by the US during WWII. The UK fell from producing 57% of world tonnage in 1947 to just 17% a decade later. By the 1970s their output was below 5% of world total, and by the 1990s it was less than 1%. In 2023, the UK produced no commercial ships at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, UK shipbuilding was undone by the very thing that had made it successful: it developed a production system that heavily leveraged skilled labor, and minimized the need for expensive infrastructure or management overheads. For a time, this system had allowed UK shipbuilders to produce ships more cheaply and efficiently than almost anywhere else. But as the nature of the shipping market, and of ships themselves, changed, the UK proved unable to change its industry in response, and it steadily lost ground to international competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The rise of UK shipbuilding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For much of recent history, the Netherlands boasted the largest and most successful shipbuilding industry. Between 1500 and 1670, Dutch shipping had grown by a factor of 10, and by the end of the 17th century the Dutch merchant fleet, made up of mostly Dutch-made ships, was larger than the commercial fleets of England, France, Spain, Portugal, and what is now Germany combined. Dutch shipbuilding was “technologically the most advanced in Europe,” and Dutch shipbuilders could build ships 40-50% cheaper than English ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of the 18th century, however, the Dutch advantage was gradually eroded by “a failure to keep pace with advances in European sailing ship design and an inherent conservatism within the industry.” But while it briefly looked like the UK would come to dominate shipbuilding in the early 19th century, the mantle instead passed to the United States. By the middle of the 19th century, thanks in part to the easy availability of ship-quality lumber, the US could build wooden ships for 20 to 25% less than in the UK, and “the very existence of the British industry was under threat”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as wooden sailing ships gave way to iron and steel steamships over the course of the 19th century, the UK reclaimed its advantage. By the 1850s, the UK was building iron ships more cheaply than wood ships, and while it took decades for iron, steel and steam to displace wood and sail — sail remained a better option than steam for very long voyages until the 1880s — Britain’s access to cheap coal, cheap iron (and later cheap steel), and cheap skilled labor (compared to the US) allowed it to dominate the transformed shipbuilding industry. By 1900, UK shipbuilding productivity was substantially higher than in the US, and even further ahead of other countries. The UK had become the “shipyard of the world” on the back of its inexpensive production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Structure of UK shipbuilding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure of the UK’s shipbuilding industry reflected the conditions it operated under. Building iron and steel ships obviously required machinery and infrastructure — machine tools, cranes, slipways (sloped areas of ground the ship would slide down upon completion) — but wherever possible, British yards still eschewed expensive machinery or infrastructure in favor of skilled labor. British yards in the late 19th and early 20th century have been described as “under-equipped in relation to those of her competitors”: for instance, while the most advanced foreign yards had large, mechanically operated cranes that could be moved from berth to berth, most British yards “retained their fixed cranes, manually operated derricks, and push-carts on rails”. Because of the notoriously cyclical shipbuilding industry, which often had “seven fat years followed by seven lean years”, using labor-intensive production methods let shipbuilders easily scale up and down their operations depending on demand: workers could be hired when they were needed, and quickly fired when weren’t. A capital intensive production operation, by contrast, couldn’t easily reduce its overheads during a downturn: one extremely large, modern, and expensive British shipyard at Dalmuir was forced to close in 1929 due to difficulty servicing its overheads when demand for new ships fell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;British shipbuilders’ production operations were in large part oriented to meet the needs of British shipowners, who made up the majority of their customers. Shipyards (and their owners) developed close relationships with shipowners, who would purchase from the same yards repeatedly; as a result, shipyards did little in the way of marketing their services. Ships in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were “expensive, custom-made commodities built in close consultation with the owner”. Frequent changes during the building process by the owner were common, and standardization was limited to non-existent. With limited ability to take advantage of economies of scale, shipyards were small and numerous, and while yards tended to specialize in certain types of ships, labor-intensive production methods made it comparatively easy for yards to adapt to producing different types of ships depending on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to minimizing infrastructure overheads, British shipyards had low management overheads; much of the work was performed by skilled labor organized into “squads,” groups of tradesmen which could organize work without needing much in the way of specific instructions. As a result, British shipyards employed comparatively few supervisors, and did little in the way of production planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because shipyard workers had little in the way of job security, the British shipbuilding industry became strongly unionized. Iron shipbuilding was done by a group of 15 different unions — riveters, boilermakers, plumbers, and so on — and there were very strict rules about which unions were allowed to do which tasks. This arrangement had its advantages — unions oversaw much of the training and apprenticeship of new workers, and allowed the work to be done with comparatively little management overhead. But it also had drawbacks: the union’s (rational) lack of trust in the shipbuilders, who they correctly viewed as considering their workers disposable, resulted in fierce opposition to changes in the nature of ship production, and made introducing method improvements fraught.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Cracks begin to appear&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first cracks in British shipbuilding hegemony began to appear after World War I. Immediately following the war, the world saw a huge increase in demand for ships: in 1919, worldwide ship production was 7.1 million gross tons, up more than double the pre-war peak of 3.3 million tons in 1913. Initially much of this output was American (thanks to the continuation of the wartime shipbuilding program past the end of the war), but as this program ended the UK was once again dominant: by 1924 the UK was producing 60% of the world’s ship tonnage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the competitive landscape of the shipbuilding industry was changing. Worldwide shipyard capacity after the war was roughly double what it had been before it. Other countries were eager to give support to their local shipbuilding industries, and foreign shipyards were catching up to British levels of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ships and the methods for producing them were also changing. New shipyard layouts and new production techniques such as welding were being experimented with, and new types of ships such as diesel-powered ships and tankers — kinds of ships British shipowners and shipbuilders seemed less interested in building — were increasingly in demand. When the booming shipbuilding market entered a downturn in the 1920s — worldwide ship output dropped from over 7 million gross tons in 1919 to 2.2 million in 1924 — the competitive pressure on British shipbuilders began to mount. In 1925 the British shipbuilding community was shocked when Furness Withy, a British shipping company, ordered several ships from Germany, citing lower costs and faster delivery times. The news was surprising enough that a British shipbuilding trade association called an emergency conference on the problem of foreign competition:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The employers reviewed the history of foreign competition and conceded that whilst before the war foreign competition had presented a threat, ‘the margin of difference then was sufficiently limited’ to prevent a successful challenge to our premier position and certainly such a catastrophe as an important British order going abroad’. The margin of difference, however, now favoured continental builders and there was every prospect of more British orders going abroad and fewer foreign orders coming to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s more, the postwar boom in shipbuilding had created a huge glut in ships and shipbuilding capacity. In the early 1920s British shipbuilding had a third more capacity than it did before the war, only to be faced with demand less than half of what it was in 1914. By 1933, worldwide seaborne trade was down 6% from 1913, but the tonnage of merchant ship capacity was up by 49%, greatly reducing demand for new ships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;British shipbuilding was further hamstrung by the Washington Naval Treaty, which was signed in 1922 and then extended by the London Naval Treaty in 1930. The treaty, signed by the UK, the US, France, Italy and Japan, attempted to prevent a naval arms race by limiting naval vessel construction for each signatory. What had been a robust British program of naval expansion was suddenly halted. Following the treaty, British naval shipbuilding fell by over 90%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of shipbuilding, increased pressure from foreign competition, and the global decline in new ship orders wreaked havoc on the British shipbuilding industry in the 1920s and 30s, to the benefit of its competitors. The UK’s fraction of worldwide ship tonnage produced declined from 60% in 1924 to 50% by the end of the 1920s, to less than 40% by the mid-1930s. Over the same period, Germany, Sweden, and Japan’s combined share rose from 12% to 36%. Numerous British shipbuilding firms ceased operations, and shipbuilding unemployment rose from 5.5% in 1920 to over 40% in 1929. In the first 9 months of 1930, only one in five of British shipbuilders received any orders at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help address the problem of excess shipyard capacity, British shipbuilders banded together to form the National Shipbuilders Security (NSS) company, which was funded to “assist the shipbuilding industry by the purchase of redundant and/or obsolete shipyards and dismantling and disposal of their contents.”. By 1938, over 216 ship berths had been demolished. The NSS also made efforts to try to improve productivity and improve the competitive position of British shipyards compared to foreign yards, though it’s not clear if this had much impact: by 1938, foreign orderbooks appeared far fuller than British ones, and the industry was palpably worried about the threat of foreign competition. It wasn’t until the Royal Navy began a period of rearmament in the late 1930s in anticipation of war that fortunes began to improve for the UK shipbuilders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Post WWII&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the end of WWII, fortunes initially looked bright for the British shipbuilding industry. German and European shipbuilding capacity had been devastated by the war, the US was dismantling its enormous wartime shipbuilding machine, and Japan was forced to cease ship production. In the immediate years following the war, the UK was once again producing more ship tonnage than the rest of the world combined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the issues of foreign competition that had increasingly threatened the UK’s dominance prior to WW2 had only retreated temporarily. What’s more, during the war, developments had taken place that would threaten the skilled labor-intensive production model that British shipbuilders relied on. To win the Battle of the Atlantic and overcome destruction to their fleet caused by German U-boats, the US had used welded, prefabricated construction to rapidly build enormous numbers of simple cargo ships: Liberty ships, Victory ships, and T-2 Tankers. In the 1950s, those methods of ship construction were brought to Japan, where they continued to be refined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;British shipbuilders could have taken advantage of these methods as well. They had seen firsthand the huge number of Liberty ships American shipyards were producing (the Liberty ship was, after all, originally a British design), and had made use of welded, prefabricated construction themselves to build vessels during wartime. But British shipbuilders perceived adopting these radically different production methods as risky. It would require enormous capital expenditure, and British shipbuilders had only survived the brutal 1930s thanks to their comparatively light overheads and labor-intensive methods. Dramatic changes to production methods would also require changes to the very strict demarcation system of its unionized labor force, which the unions, naturally distrustful of shipyard operators, were sure to resist. And while the US had successfully built thousands of ships very rapidly during the war, it had come at a cost: the US cargo ships, using modern methods, were more expensive to build than similar British ships. Though some British shipbuilders recognized the potential of welding and prefabrication, they weren’t clearly worth reorganizing the entire industry around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And beyond their rational reluctance, British shipbuilders were simply not predisposed towards adopting radical innovations. Many of them (along with many British shipowners) were suspicious of welding, partly due to natural conservatism and partly due to several high-profile failures where welded ships cracked in two. (As late as 1954, British shipbuilders noted that “owners do not want a welded box, they expect plenty of riveting.”) British shipbuilders similarly proved somewhat reluctant to enter the world of tanker and diesel-powered ship construction, which were becoming an increasingly large fraction of ship construction. They also seemed to always have an excuse for not making large, new capital investments: when the yards were busy, such investments were disruptive and made it difficult to get on with the business of building ships, and when they weren’t, there was no funding available to do so. Shipbuilders were often small, family-run businesses, sometimes by descendants of the original founders, and they were generally happy to simply carry on business as they always had. And broader ownership did not foster innovation either, with firms distributing their profits as dividends rather than reinvesting them in the business, driving the stock prices of shipbuilders up more than any other manufacturing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, British shipyards tended to be cramped, with little room for expansion, and British shipbuilders were fearful that any postwar boom in shipbuilding would (once again) be followed by a bust, requiring retrenchment and making investment in expanding facilities unwise. (One British shipbuilder predicted that “it will be a case of last in, first out, and that Britain’s policy of modernising her shipyards without any great expansion of their capacity will pay dividends in her future competition.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, even as the world shipbuilding market boomed in the 1950s, UK shipbuilding output stayed roughly constant. Between 1947 and 1957, UK ship output rose by 18%, while worldwide output comparatively rose by over 300%. Countries like Germany, Sweden, and Japan picked up the slack. The UK lost its position as the world’s biggest shipbuilder by tonnage to Japan in 1956. By the end of the 1950s, Germany and Sweden had passed the UK in ship tonnage built for export and by the end of the 1960s they were outproducing the UK in overall ship tonnage. Between 1950 and 1975, one of the largest shipbuilding booms in history, the UK was the only major shipbuilding country to not increase its output at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As other countries expanded their output, adopted modern production methods, and built new, efficient shipyards, British shipbuilders found themselves increasingly uncompetitive. Their costs were higher than those of foreign shipbuilders, and their delivery times were longer. Shipbuilding had traditionally been done on a “cost plus” basis, where owners were charged some percentage above costs incurred when building the ship, but owners were increasingly requiring fixed price bidding. British shipbuilders, with their comparative lack of production planning and managerial control, struggled to adapt to the new reality. British shipowners, traditionally the primary customer of British shipyards, were increasingly buying their ships abroad, citing the UK’s high costs and long delivery times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Attempts to remedy the situation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigations into potential problems in the shipbuilding industry started shortly into the post-war era. In 1948, following a British shipowner cancelling several orders with British yards due to “costs and delivery times,” the government stepped in to conduct analyses of the shipbuilding industry. One, produced by the Labour Party’s research arm, argued that “that new methods of construction, utilising welding and prefabrication, required a complete reconstruction of the yards, and that this could be best achieved via Government finance and assistance…It seems inevitable that a prosperous shipbuilding industry will require heavy expenditure and it is very doubtful whether the industry is willing and or able to undertake this.” The other, produced by the Shipbuilding Costs Committee (staffed largely by industry leaders), was a “’a very non-controversial report,’ which provided ‘no useful recommendations on which action could be taken.’” In light of the industry’s full postwar order books, the government opted not to take any action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the mid-1950s, the government examined the practices of British naval shipbuilding, and concluded that “there was a need for a wholesale modernisation of the shipyards in terms of layouts, plant and equipment particularly to increase the use of prefabrication.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The return on capital employed and investment rates were criticised as poor and British costs were felt to be comparatively high in international terms. Restrictive practices were noted, but more worryingly there was a shortage of skilled labour in the industry, which was responsible for the British single-shift system, with consequently expensive overtime, compared with the double-shift system which was normal on the Continent and in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 1957 report from the Working Party on the Transport of Oil From the Middle East similarly noted that the industry had been “sluggish in responding to the opportunities from expansion” and criticized its lack of investment (though it did note that some shipyards had begun some degree of modernization).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the booming shipbuilding market turned at the end of the 1950s, these investigations grew more frequent and more worried. A 1959 Treasury report concluded the industry “is not competitive. It has not modernised its production methods and organisation so quickly or so thoroughly as its competitors. Its labour relations are poor, and its management, while improving, is not as good as it might be.” It was further “pessimistic over delivery dates and prices and concluded that the prospects of the industry becoming competitive could not be rated very high.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This report was followed in 1960 by a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research report on the shipbuilding industry, which declared that the industry’s R&amp;amp;D efforts had been “woeful”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…production control in the industry was primitive, the total effort devoted to research and development was insufficient, and almost no organised research had been applied to production and management problems with a view to improving the productivity of capital and labour and reducing costs.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That same year, the head of the UK’s Shipbuilding Advisory Committee staged a high-profile resignation, stating that the excuses of the industry to avoid investigating its problems were “so frustrating that to continue serving the industry as chairman would be fruitless.” In response to the resignation, in 1961, the Advisory Committee released a report on the shipbuilding industry. However, other than arguing that credit facilities (lending to shipowners to make purchasing ships easier) should be expanded, the report gave few strong recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Shipbuilding Advisory Committee report was followed by another government-commissioned report on why British shipowners were buying from foreign yards; the report concluded that the major reasons were “price; price and delivery date; price and credit facilities; guaranteed delivery dates; and the reluctance of British builders to install foreign-built engines.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the industry continued to struggle in the 1960s, the reports piled up even higher. A 1962 report on productivity commissioned by the British Ship Research Association noted “the underdeveloped nature of managerial hierarchies in the industry as a serious weakness and recommended a more systematic approach to production control”. A report by the British Ship Exports Association on the Norwegian market (traditionally one of Britain’s strongest ship export markets) noted that “Norwegian customers... have voiced a series of complaints, the principal of which. .. is that in addition to regarding us as unreliable over delivery, many are now saying that we cannot be trusted to honour contracts.” The author of the report noted that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…every reported speech by a British shipbuilder in the Norwegian press usually comprised a list of excuses for poor performance, ranging from official and unofficial stoppages, shortages of labour, failings on the part of subcontractors, modernisation schemes not producing the anticipated results, to recently completed contracts having entailed substantial losses. The impression thus gained by the Norwegians, according to Holt, was of an industry where the shipbuilders had no control or responsibility over problems, and worse, had no ideas as to how to address the problems. (since 1918 147).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the UK’s share of Norwegian shipbuilding, its largest export market, fell from 48% in 1951 to 2.8% in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As reports documenting the UK’s shipbuilding troubles accumulated, things continued to look worse and worse for the shipbuilders. The market for ocean liners, once a major source of demand for British shipbuilders, was being threatened by the rise of commercial air travel. Transatlantic travel by air surpassed transatlantic ocean travel in 1957, and the ascendance of commercial jetliners further eroded the market. By 1969, passengers crossing the Atlantic by plane outnumbered maritime passengers 24 to 1. And the explosion of global trade in the 1950s and 60s was met not just with more ships, but with larger ships (such as Very Large Crude Carriers for transporting oil) which were cheaper to build and operate. The simple Liberty ship built in huge numbers by the US during the war was about 10,000 tons deadweight, but by the end of the 1950s Japan was building ships in excess of 100,000 tons deadweight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, by the end of the 1960s Japanese shipyards were building drydocks with 400,000 tons capacity. By comparison, British shipyards, which had been built in an era of much smaller ships, had trouble accommodating these huge ships, in part due to lack of space for expansion. (Some space-constrained British yards attempted to get around their space constraints by building large ships in two halves, which were then stitched together in the water.) And as ships got larger, prefabricated construction methods got more advanced, utilizing massive gantry cranes to assemble ships out of huge pre-built blocks. Advances in prefabrication continued to drive down costs in the shipyards that implemented them. Between 1958 and 1964, the labor hours required to build a given amount of tonnage in a Japanese shipyard fell by 60%, and the amount of steel fell by 36%. Over the same period the UK’s share of global shipbuilding fell from 15% to 8%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout this period, major advances in ship technology were increasingly happened outside the UK. A history of UK shipbuilding noted that 13 of 15 major ship innovations introduced between 1800 and 1950 were first widely adopted in Britain. But of 14 major innovations introduced between 1950 and 1980, only three were first widely adopted in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neither the government nor the British shipbuilding industry seemed willing to take bold steps to try to improve its fortunes. The Board of Trade stated in 1960 that there was little point to government intervention “until the prospects of the industry are very patently bad”. Despite the numerous government reports pointing out the various industry deficiencies, by 1963 the only government action that had been taken was the aforementioned expansion of credit facilities to shipowners. British shipbuilders remained convinced that a decline in the market was just around the corner and that the expensive shipyards of their competitors would become millstones. And despite the shipbuilding market shifting towards larger, more standardized ships sold at fixed prices, UK builders tried to stick with their tried-and-true strategy of ships tailor-built to the needs of British shipowners. But as British shipowners, who themselves made up an increasingly small fraction of global shipping (the UK’s share of global shipping tonnage fell from 45% in 1900 to 16% in 1960), increasingly took their business to foreign shipyards, British shipbuilders found that “the protective skin that tradition and convention gave to the home market has been split beyond repair”. By 1962, the bankruptcy of many UK shipbuilders had finally become “an alarming reality rather than an impending possibility”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until after the 1964 elections, with a new Labour government, that more serious actions to rescue the shipbuilding industry began to be taken (possibly because the “vast majority of shipbuilding yards lay within Labour parliamentary seats”). In early 1965, a British group led by the Minister of Trade visited several Japanese shipyards, which were found to have lower costs, shorter delivery times, and higher productivity than British yards. Following this visit, the government instigated yet another investigation into the British shipbuilding industry. The resulting report (known as the Geddes report, after Reay Geddes, the head of the committee that produced it), enumerated a long list of problems of UK shipbuilders, including high costs (20% more than competitors on average), long delivery times, late deliveries, out of date infrastructure, poor labor relations, and poor management. Moreover, even at prices 20% higher than their competitors, British shipyards struggled to be profitable, with the report noting that “many of the orders now in hand will not be remunerative to cover costs”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;British shipyards’ traditional production methods, which demanded little in the way of management, meant that yards had few supervisors. The supervisors they did have had often worked their way up from the shop floor and had never received any business or management training. As a result, production planning and estimates of labor required were poor. While this may have been acceptable when vessels were custom-produced on a cost-plus basis, it made yards ill-equipped for a market where fixed-cost pricing was the norm. A history of British shipbuilding noted that “in an increasingly competitive industry British shipyards did not successfully perform the financial management tasks—marketing, budgeting and procurement--necessary to build vessels profitably.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Geddes report also noted that labor relations were abysmal, and strict adherence to labor demarcation rules (which themselves varied extensively from yard to yard) greatly hampered productivity. The labor demarcation problem was so severe that in some yards it literally took three different workers to change a lightbulb:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…a laborer (member of the Transport and General Workers Union) [to] carry the ladder to site, a rigger (member of the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers Union) [to] erect it and place it in the proper position, and an electrician (member of the Electrical Trades Union) [to] actually remove the old bulb and screw in the new one. Production was often halted while waiting for a member of the appropriate union to arrive to perform the job reserved by agreement for them. (sunset 96)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Geddes committee further argued that none of these issues could be fixed at the scale contemporary shipbuilders were operating at, and that a prerequisite for rescuing the industry was grouping existing shipbuilders together to give them the scale needed to be internationally competitive. The report recommended consolidation, and for a comparatively small amount of government financing (37.5 million pounds in grants and loans, and another 30 million in credit guarantees) to be awarded over the next four years to shipbuilders that consolidated and met a strict set of performance targets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The post-Geddes industry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1967, the Shipbuilding Inquiry Act implementing the Geddes Report’s recommendations, was passed, and over the next several years, 27 major British shipbuilders were consolidated into 12 groups (though some of these “groups” were groups of just one). As shipyards consolidated, government financing began to flow: between 1967 and 1972 almost 160 million pounds (much more than had been recommended by the Geddes Report) were provided by the government to various shipbuilders, and the shipping board made recommendations for over a billion pounds worth of bank loan guarantees for British shipowners purchasing in British yards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of this helped stem the decline. By 1971, the government-backed British shipyards had achieved “no gains in competitiveness, no improvement in turnover, falling profitability and cash resources [that were] becoming rapidly inadequate.” Late deliveries continued to dog the shipbuilders: from 1967 to 1971 nearly 40% of British ships were 1 month late, and nearly 10% were six months late. With fixed-cost contracts, stiff penalties for late deliveries, and rapid inflation (over 20% from 1967 to 1971), late deliveries drastically eroded profitability, and much of the government funding actually went to writing off shipbuilders’ losses. Between 1967 and 1972 three major shipbuilders — Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (a post-Geddes amalgamation of several smaller builders), Cammell Laird, and Harland and Wolff (the company that built the Titanic, once the largest shipbuilder in the world) — were rescued from bankruptcy and became owned “wholly or in part by the British government”. In the early 1970s, the shipbuilding industry performed “even below the Geddes ‘worst case scenario”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry’s failure to improve seems to be partly due to a lack of urgency on the shipbuilders part. A combination of factors (British pound devaluation, unexpectedly high enthusiasm for the credit offerings for British shipowners, the Suez canal closing) created enough demand for British ships in the late 1960s that the orderbooks swelled. While these orders were a small fraction of worldwide orders, the rise in demand was sufficient to dampen the urgency for reforming shipbuilding practices. In 1972, yet another report on the British shipbuilding industry (this one produced by Booz-Allen Hamilton), was released. It found that nearly every problem listed in the Geddes report had gotten worse:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This review of the U.K. shipbuilding industry is pessimistic about the general background situation, and critical of the industry in many areas. U.K. yards generally are under-capitalized and poorly managed; the industry has a poor reputation amongst its customers, particularly for delivery and labour relations; overseas competition has moved more rapidly to modernize and re-equip its facilities and is now better placed to face the forecast surplus of capacity which will exist for the remainder of the 1970’s&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even companies that had invested in the infrastructure they needed to compete in the modern shipbuilding world found themselves struggling. Harland and Wolff, for instance, had been “reconfigured in the 1960s to build tankers of up to 1 million deadweight tons”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…it should have thrived during the 1967-73 large tanker boom. Instead, due to the typical British shipbuilding problems of high costs, low productivity, poor labor relations, and late delivery, it lost money even with a full order book.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem of money-losing contracts became so severe that some British shipbuilders found themselves paying owners to cancel contracts they were unable to build profitably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With seemingly no way of returning the industry to commercial profitability, and already operating struggling shipbuilders directly, the government moved to full nationalization. In 1974, a Labour government was elected with promises to nationalize the industry, which eventually took place in 1977. The Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act of 1977 created a new company, British Shipbuilders, encompassing 97% of Britain’s commercial shipbuilding capacity.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even nationalization did nothing to rescue the industry. After peaking in 1975, the worldwide shipbuilding market collapsed in the wake of the 1973 energy crisis. The shipbuilding industries in countries like Japan became desperate for new orders, and recent, subsidized entrants like South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil were hungry as well. In the face of such fierce competition, the new British Shipbuilders company wilted. Despite taking virtually any order that it could get, even at loss-making prices, the UK’s shipbuilding industry continued its inexorable decline. Between 1975 and 1985, the UK’s shipbuilding output declined by nearly 90%, and its share of the world market fell from 3.6% to less than 1%. British Shipbuilders began re-privatization in 1983 with the passage of the British Shipbuilders Act, and over the next several years most of those newly privatized yards would close. In 2024, the UK produced just 0.01% of the commercial ship tonnage built worldwide that year. In 2022 and 2023, the percentage was 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his book on the decline of the British shipbuilding industry, Edward Lorenz argues that while British shipbuilders precipitated their own decline, their decisions were essentially rational, the product of the constraints that they were operating under at the time. A production system based heavily on leveraging skilled, union-trained labor, minimizing the need for expensive infrastructure or equipment and with a minimum of management overheads helped keep British costs low; the labor force could be scaled up and down depending on demand, and workers could easily move from yard to yard as the work required. This production system worked reasonably well for decades, and only truly began to unravel after WWII, when the shipbuilding market transformed technologically and transactionally, and began demanding much larger vessels, made from welded, block-construction, sold under fixed price contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While British shipbuilders could have responded by enthusiastically embracing the new methods, they had learned from a lifetime of doing business in a wildly fluctuating market that investments in expensive new shipbuilding infrastructure or high-overhead production methods were risky. Their strategy of rapidly scaling their labor force depending on day-to-day needs had bred a deep distrust between management and labor, and created a strict demarcation system that was difficult to dislodge. Decades of urban development in port cities had made physical expansion of shipyards difficult. Uncertainty about whether transformation was truly needed, and the certainty of costly disruptions should they try, resulted in British shipbuilders sticking with their existing production methods as the rest of the world passed them by.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, globally the economic pressure to shift shipbuilding towards locations with lower labor costs was immense. Sweden modernized its operations far more effectively than the UK, and was one of the most efficient, capable shipbuilding countries in the world in the post-war era, but this didn’t stop the Swedish shipbuilding industry from being hollowed out in the face of competition from Asian producers. Similarly, Japan’s skill in shipbuilding hasn’t stopped it from losing ground to China in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a telling bit in a book about the nationalized British Shipbuilders company called “Crossing the Bar”. At an international shipbuilders conference in London in 1983, a UK shipbuilder asked a Korean delegate why they were keeping their prices so low. The delegate responded that they weren’t worried about UK or European competition, or even Japanese competition: they were worried about China. Several decades on, Korea is now losing ground in the shipbuilding market to China too. So, it’s not clear if a much more vigorous British shipbuilding industry would have been all that much more successful in resisting its ultimate decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the lack of motivation (rational or otherwise) of British shipbuilders to modernize their operations certainly did not help. Perhaps they would have ultimately lost out to low-cost Korean and Japanese builders anyway, but had they shared Japan’s “burning zeal” to make their industry competitive, they might have kept the wind in their sails longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DSIR report was initially leaked to the media, and the final published version was stripped of much of its more trenchant criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harland and Wolff, despite then being owned by the British government, was left as an independent entity due to political concerns regarding Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all. It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. Then it provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because beets is designed as a library, it can do almost anything you can imagine for your music collection. Via plugins, beets becomes a panacea:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fetch or calculate all the metadata you could possibly need: album art, lyrics, genres, tempos, ReplayGain levels, or acoustic fingerprints.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get metadata from MusicBrainz, Discogs, or Beatport. Or guess metadata using songs’ filenames or their acoustic fingerprints.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transcode audio to any format you like.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check your library for duplicate tracks and albums or for albums that are missing tracks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in any browser that supports HTML5 Audio.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;…and lots more.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If beets doesn’t do what you want yet, writing your own plugin is shockingly simple if you know a little Python.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a love-hate relationship with BART. I’m grateful for it, but let’s just say it’s not always the most reliable so it’s nice to see before hand when the train you need is due to arrive. There are plenty of projects out there that show real-time BART arrival information. This one does that too, it’s nothing groundbreaking, but I wanted to build my own version that captures the vintage BART platform sign vibe I associate with commuting between the East Bay and my job in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Hardware 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SPI Red 20x4 Character OLED Display Module from BuyDisplay&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SparkFun Logic Level Converter&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to find a display that felt as close as possible to the real thing, though I knew it wouldn’t be an exact match. I was mainly after the right vibe, and the BuyDisplay red OLED character display nailed it. The PCB was a bit taller than the display itself, which affected the final dimensions, but it was a tradeoff I was happy to make. I love an OLED.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only other components I needed on the electronics side were the ESP32-C6 to run the display and fetch the latest BART arrival times, along with a logic level shifter. Both parts are small, so I soldered them onto a piece of perfboard with header pins, allowing the whole assembly to plug directly into the display like a cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Firmware 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The official BART API uses GTFS Realtime, a data specification developed in collaboration with Google. I’d never worked with it before, and expecting the ESP32 to fetch and parse the raw feed on its own felt like a stretch (or at least, too much for me to figure out). So instead, I built a middleware service that handles the heavy lifting: it pulls the data, extracts only what I need, and serves a simplified API tailored for the display the ESP32 calls. All the code is available on my GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Demo 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I had all the pieces together, including some early 3D prints of the housing, I assembled everything to get a feel for the scale and how it works as a finished product. This video shows it all together but before paint. Data is being pulled in live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Finishing 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that was left to do was some post processing of the 3d prints and paint, along with some little details like screws and stickers of the company that made the real deal platform signs and which platform the sign was for. I used a Brothers label maker for both. 3D files are available to download on Makerworld.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Result 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used double-stick tape to mount this under a metal shelf above my monitor. Now I can see upcoming train arrivals at a glance, and the display also shows the time and official BART platform safety messages, like staying behind the yellow line, which really makes it feel like I’m standing on the platform. Sure, I could just look it up online, but having this miniature version of the platform display on my wall is much more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Linux Kernel Looks To "Bite The Bullet" In Enabling Microsoft C Extensions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Two patches queued into the Linux kernel's build system development tree, kbuild-next, would enable the -fms-extensions compiler argument everywhere for allowing GCC and LLVM/Clang to use the Microsoft C Extensions when compiling the Linux kernel. Being in kbuild-next these patches will likely be submitted for the Linux 6.19 kernel merge window next month but remains to be seen if there will be any last minute objections to this change. &lt;lb/&gt;The -fms-extensions compiler option honored by the GNU Compiler Collection and LLVM/Clang allow enabling some non-standard C/C++ constructs used within Microsoft header files and honored by the the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler. For Linux kernel development purposes, enabling the Microsoft C Extensions would allow including a tagged struct or union anonymously in another struct/union.&lt;lb/&gt;Going back many years there have been patches floated to unconditionally enable -fms-extensions for the Linux kernel but they haven't made it past the Linux kernel mailing list. But now with these two patches being in kbuild-next mean that it will likely be submitted for the Linux 6.19 kernel merge window barring any objections from prominent Linux kernel developers or Linus Torvalds himself.&lt;lb/&gt;Rasmus Villemoes argued with Kbuild: enable -fms-extensions that would allow for "prettier code" and others have noted in the past the potential for saving stack space and all around being beneficial in being able to leverage the Microsoft C behavior:&lt;lb/&gt;The second patch is kbuild: Add '-fms-extensions' to areas with dedicated CFLAGS to ensure -fms-extensions is passed for the CPU architectures that rely on their own CFLAGS being set rather than the main KBUILD_CFLAGS.&lt;lb/&gt;Linus Torvalds chimed in on the prior mailing list discussion and doesn't appear to be against enabling -fms-extensions beginning with the Linux 6.19 kernel.&lt;lb/&gt;Enabling -fms-extensions will allow for some better looking C code though some may feel the wrong way around Microsoft C behavior being permitted for the mainline Linux kernel coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The -fms-extensions compiler option honored by the GNU Compiler Collection and LLVM/Clang allow enabling some non-standard C/C++ constructs used within Microsoft header files and honored by the the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler. For Linux kernel development purposes, enabling the Microsoft C Extensions would allow including a tagged struct or union anonymously in another struct/union.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going back many years there have been patches floated to unconditionally enable -fms-extensions for the Linux kernel but they haven't made it past the Linux kernel mailing list. But now with these two patches being in kbuild-next mean that it will likely be submitted for the Linux 6.19 kernel merge window barring any objections from prominent Linux kernel developers or Linus Torvalds himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rasmus Villemoes argued with Kbuild: enable -fms-extensions that would allow for "prettier code" and others have noted in the past the potential for saving stack space and all around being beneficial in being able to leverage the Microsoft C behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"Once in a while, it turns out that enabling -fms-extensions could allow some slightly prettier code. But every time it has come up, the code that had to be used instead has been deemed "not too awful" and not worth introducing another compiler flag for.&lt;lb/&gt;That's probably true for each individual case, but then it's somewhat of a chicken/egg situation.&lt;lb/&gt;If we just "bite the bullet" as Linus says and enable it once and for all, it is available whenever a use case turns up, and no individual case has to justify it.&lt;lb/&gt;A lore.kernel.org search provides these examples:&lt;lb/&gt;- https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/[email protected]/&lt;lb/&gt;- https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/[email protected]/&lt;lb/&gt;- https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/[email protected]/&lt;lb/&gt;- https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/[email protected]/&lt;lb/&gt;- https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wjeZwww6Zswn6F_iZTpUihTSNKYppLqj36iQDDhfntuEw@mail.gmail.com/&lt;lb/&gt;Undoubtedly, there are more places in the code where this could also be used but where -fms-extensions just didn't come up in any discussion."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second patch is kbuild: Add '-fms-extensions' to areas with dedicated CFLAGS to ensure -fms-extensions is passed for the CPU architectures that rely on their own CFLAGS being set rather than the main KBUILD_CFLAGS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linus Torvalds chimed in on the prior mailing list discussion and doesn't appear to be against enabling -fms-extensions beginning with the Linux 6.19 kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enabling -fms-extensions will allow for some better looking C code though some may feel the wrong way around Microsoft C behavior being permitted for the mainline Linux kernel coding.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;EU takes aim at plastic pellets to prevent their nightmare cleanup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first glance, the tiny plastic pellets appear relatively harmless. No bigger than a lentil, these "nurdles" are destined to be melted down to make everything from car bumpers to salad bowls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when tens of millions of them spill from trucks or cargo ships they are devilish to clean up, blighting landscapes and washing up around the world for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the European Parliament could approve tougher new rules aimed at preventing such disastrous spills, and reducing their pollution impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If approved, they will require companies in the European Union to adopt safeguards in handling and transporting nurdles, which are produced by petrochemical giants from fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anywhere between 52,140 tonnes and 184,290 tonnes of pellets entered the environment in the EU in 2019, according to the European Commission, which proposed the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This is equivalent to between 2,100 and 7,300 trucks full of pellets per year," the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Light, buoyant and insoluble, these tiny pellets present an almost insurmountable challenge once scattered in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recovery is "a physically intense and time-consuming task" mostly done by hand, said Kevin Tallec from Cedre, a French non-profit organisation that specialises in water contamination and cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We can be 100 percent sure that if there's pellet pollution, we won't be able to recover all of them," Tallec, a marine biologist, told AFP in Brest, where Cedre is headquartered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Chronic problem -&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the worst spills occurred off Sri Lanka in 2021 when thousands of tonnes of plastic pellets were lost from a stricken cargo ship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nurdles coated an 80-kilometre (50-mile) stretch of beach on the island's western coast, and fishing was prohibited for months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In northwest Spain, volunteers used strainers to sift nurdles from sand along the Atlantic coast after containers full of pellets fell off a cargo vessel in late 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"When I was little, I used to pick them up on the beaches, just a few at the time. But the pollution has become chronic," said Amandine Le Moan, co-founder of the French coastal conservation group Ystopia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are ingested by marine life, particularly sea birds and turtles, while the chemicals in microplastics also present a potential risk to human health, the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spills also hurt tourism and fishing, it added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nurdle spills often occur when an ill-placed shipping container tumbles overboard, and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has issued non-binding recommendations to try to prevent this happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Major industry players that have adopted these recommendations include Armateurs de France, which represents French maritime transport and services companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These containers must be identified, declared, and treated in a specific way, like chemicals and hazardous materials placed below deck," Laurent Martens, general delegate of Armateurs de France, told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Down the line -&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But transportation is not the only source of spills, Cedre's Tallec said, with nurdles also lost through operational channels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's also a broader issue involving the value chain, which handles these pellets in a way that doesn't prevent their loss into the environment," said Lucie Padovani from Surfrider Foundation Europe, an ocean conservation group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, in Ecaussinnes, an industrial town in Belgium that hosts large petrochemical operators, plastic pellets have been found scattered throughout the landscape and in local rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;French petrochemical giants Arkema, and the American companies Dow and ExxonMobil, declined to comment when reached by AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chemical trades groups, such as Plastics Europe and France Chimie, did not respond to AFP's requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plastics manufacturers insist they are not the weak link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We are well aware of all the issues, and obviously plastic pollution is something we need to get rid of," said Caroline Chaussard, director of sustainable development at Polyvia, an industry group for French plastics manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The biggest leaks are not at the processor level -- that's where they are easiest to contain, since they are in a limited area," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joseph Tayefeh, secretary general of Plastalliance, which represents European plastics makers, said "this is an expensive raw material that no one wants to waste".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A kilo costs between 1 euro ($1.17) and 1.3 euros," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Major oil- and gas-producing nations have resisted efforts to limit the amount of new plastic manufactured every year, a figure estimated at 400 million tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August, the latest round of negotiations on a global treaty to combat plastic pollution collapsed without agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Philippe Bolo, a French MP who lobbied for a tough treaty, said the scourge of nurdles "revealed the ubiquity of plastic" in modern life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The more we consume, the more we will need them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Microsoft's lack of quality control is out of control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;At one point, Microsoft's QC was legendary. Now, it's the wrong kind of legend&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OPINION I have a habit of ironically referring to Microsoft's various self-induced whoopsies as examples of the company's "legendary approach to quality control." While the robustness of Windows NT in decades past might qualify as "legendary", anybody who has had to use the company's wares in recent years might quibble with the word "quality."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As repeated Azure outages due to configuration errors have shown, "control" is perhaps also inappropriate these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's difficult to pinpoint precisely where it went wrong for Microsoft when it comes to quality. In 2014, the company decided it could do without many of its testers. Mary Jo Foley reported that "a good chunk" were being laid off. Microsoft didn't need to bother with traditional methods of testing code. Waterfall was out. Agile was in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consequences have been difficult to avoid. There was the infamous Windows 10 Update Of The Damned (also known as the Windows 10 October 2018 Update), which deleted files, and despite Microsoft slowing down the release cadence after that, quality does not seem to have improved. Every few weeks, the company's "legendary approach to quality control" is evident, whether through a self-inflicted wound resulting from issues with an update or, worse, the company's cloud collapsing due to a faulty configuration change being rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While allowances can be made for the former – the Windows ecosystem consists of hundreds of millions of devices, and some issues are inevitable (even if others are inexcusable) – the same cannot be said for the latter. Sure, Azure is vast, but it should be a known quantity as far as Microsoft is concerned. Therefore, repeatedly rolling out changes to production that leave customers with inoperative services is more than questionable quality control; it calls into question the company's competence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Win10 still clings to over 40% of devices weeks after Microsoft pulls support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microsoft keeps adding stuff into Windows we don't want – here's what we actually need&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows 11 tiptoes further into dark mode with new dialogs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clippy rises from the dead in major update to Copilot and its voice interface&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me over and over again ... well, I guess that makes me a Microsoft customer."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So perhaps it is time to retire the phrase "legendary approach to quality control" and replace it with something more befitting the situation?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where The Register readership comes in, particularly those who have been at the sharp, pointy end of Redmond's antics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How would you describe the quality of Microsoft's wares these days, and the amount of testing that has been done before the company's latest emission?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, the word "pisspoor" might confuse the international audience, and naughty words could trip firewall filters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But things seem to have moved beyond "legendary approach to quality control." ®&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks back I got a note on Bluesky, linking me to a website offering a free computer. The owner was in Cambridge, not far from me, and the computer was an HP 9000/300 Series - a Model 340, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HP 9000 line of workstations and servers ran from the early 1980s through to the late 2000s (see this great history page at openpa.net for more details). It encompassed many processor architectures, including Itanium, HP's own Precision Architecture (aka PA-RISC), and their earlier FOCUS architecture. Alongside the early FOCUS machines, they also had a line of Motorola 68K based UNIX workstations - the 300 series. This is a machine from that series, and I thought a 68030 based UNIX workstation just sounded fascinating. Something of the same kind of processor and vintage as the Macintosh IIx, but part of the lineage that led to my beloved Visualize B132L+ and C3000 workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E-mails were exchanged with the owner, Ben, and I was invited to pop over and collect the machine. And then, whilst I was there, it turns out Ben had a few more machines he'd be happy to move on to a new owner, to free up some space. And. Well. I went home with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An HP 9000 Model 340 (68030)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An HP 9000 Model 715 (PA-7000)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A DEC microVAX 3100 (KA-41)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An IBM RS/6000 7012-320 (POWER 2)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Sun SPARCstation 20 (HyperSPARC)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Sun SPARCstation 4 (MicroSPARC)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Sun SPARCstation 10 (SuperSPARC)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some HP mice, some DDS tapes, and some SCSI terminators&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This haul was frankly ridiculous, and huge thanks to Ben for his generosity. It was also more machines that I literally had space for at home (thanks to a very large pile of SPARCstations I haven't yet moved on) and so I immediately called my friend Matt and arranged to drop off the SPARCstation 10 and the HP 9000 Model 715. I already have an HP 9000 Model 712 and they're similar enough I'm happy to let Matt hold on to the 715 for now. He also had his name down for the SPARCstation 10 I already had, so it made sense to let him have both in case one he needs spares.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over at Matt's house we fired them up and were delighted to see the both booted up OK, which was very promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've since donated the SPARCstation 4 (working) and the microVAX3100 (sadly dead) to new homes, free of charge. I've also tested the RS/6000, which was also dead, and the SPARCstation 20, which not only worked but turned out to contain two ROSS HyperSPARC CPU cards running at 150 MHz. As SPARCstations 20s go, it doesn't really get much better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, we're here to talk about HP-UX. And before I can do that, I need to explain that the Model 340 doesn't have a disk drive.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Motorola 68030 CPU at 16.7 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Motorola 68882 FPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;16 MiB RAM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High Resolution Colour Graphics Board (1280x1024 in 256 colours at 75 Hz), with output via 3x BNC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HP-IB interface for disk drives and peripherals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HIL interface for keyboard and mouse&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10base2 Ethernet interface&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry, you can't see the 68030 or the 68882 FPU - they are underneath the high-res graphics adapter, and I didn't want to take it apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you also cannot see - because it does not have them - is a floppy controller or a SCSI controller, or any kind of disk controller. You're supposed to either network boot it, or use an HP-IB disk drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not (or rather, I did not) have any 10base2 networking gear, or a BNC to VGA adapter, or any HP-IB cables or devices, or an HIL keyboard (although I do have a bag of HIL mice). But, you know, eBay exists, and I was able to get the first three things in short order at fairly reasonable prices. The keyboards, however, are outrageously expensive, and being HIL interface, you can't just use a PC keyboard as a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here Matt comes to the rescue because it turned out he had an HP 9000 Model 705 kicking around, and that also uses HIL, and he had the keyboard to go with it. Seeing as he now had my Model 715 (which supports both PS/2 and HIL), he was happy to let me borrow the 705 and its keyboard in exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazingly, the Model 340 appears to be in great working order. When you turn it on, it does a self-test, and then fails to find any devices to boot from. I now do have an HP-IB card (well, a GPIB card) for my Windows XP PC, and a copy of HPDrive from hp9845.net. This is an emulator for HP HP-IB drive units - floppy drives, hard disk drives and CD-ROM drives. I have booted the machine with it, but I found it to be quite slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's more fun though, is putting it into a cluster with the Model 705 and network booting it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, that a 68030 machine network booting from a PA-RISC machine ... and sharing the same root filesystem. But aren't PA-RISC binaries and 68K binaries quite different? Oh yes, they really are. So, how does that work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;HP-UX 9 for Series 700 (PA-RISC)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe there are several versions of HP-UX that support setting up a cluster, but HP-UX 9 is the last that supported mixed 68K and PA-RISC clusters (or, as HP would call it, mixed Series 300 and Series 700 suppport). HP-UX 10 dropped 68K support and was PA-RISC only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, let's install HP-UX 9 on the Model 705 I got from Matt. I found this guide quite helpful but I'll outline the basic steps here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Side note: look at that keyboard for more than a few seconds, and you'll realise it's really weird)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 1 is to boot the Install CD, which I do using a BlueSCSI. This formats the hard disk - but only if it recognises the make and model from its &lt;code&gt;disktab&lt;/code&gt; file. This is an annoyance that seems common to early UNIX systems - SunOS 4 has a similar problem - but I was able to swap some drives around and put a 2GB Seagate ST11200N into the machine, which it seems happy with. You'd certainly have no chance with a more modern 9.1GB drive. Once the format is done, it lays down a very basic root filesystem, and reboots into it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 2 is the actual installation. I put the image onto the BlueSCSI (I'm using HP-UX 9.07 Core OS B2826-13716), and the installation picks it up and asks what packages I want to install. I pick Select All Filesets on the Source Media, because I've got plenty of disk space - I think a full install is only about 200 MiB. It takes about 20 minutes to copy the files over, and then we can set up the root password, hostname, IP address, DNS server, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An absolute Cluster ... Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first attempt at setting up HP-UX 9 on this machine was made difficult because the network card wasn't working. This was either because I had the switch on the rear of the machine in the Factory Setup position instead of the Normal position, or because I had the internal jumpers set to use the AUI port instead of the BNC, and it knew I didn't have an MAU attached to the AUI port. Either way, I resolved both issues at the same time and after that, the network started up on boot. If you cannot bring up a network interface on a Model 705, check both I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We administer the system using SAM. It's a TUI tool, and easy enough to go in and set this machine up as a Cluster host.&lt;/p&gt;

   â This system ("hp705") should be in single user state before being     â

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmmm, OK, fine, I'll drop to single-user mode and do it on the console instead of over telnet. Sorry, no more copy-pastes of the cluster setup process, but you aren't missing much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we're in single user mode, it lets us set up a cluster. And once we've accepted that it's an irreversible process (weird), actually setting up the cluster takes an age to complete. It's not immediately clear why it needs to thrash the disk for 20 minutes, but once that's done, we reboot and then we can go back in to SAM and add a new machine to the cluster. But, it's only letting us as S700 machines (i.e. PA-RISC machines), not S300 machines (that have the 68K architecture).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another quick side-note here to shout-out to HP-UX for including a sensible &lt;code&gt;/etc/nsswitch.conf&lt;/code&gt; out of the box - one that looks at the &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; file and then the DNS resolver configured in &lt;code&gt;/etc/resolv.conf&lt;/code&gt;. Most of you think this a weird thing to celebrate, but some of you have had the pain of installing old versions of SunOS and Solaris before, and you do not think this a weird thing to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;HP-UX 9 for Series 300 (68K)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HP-UX 9 for the Series 300 is a different set of install CDs, containg 68K binaries. It makes sense that we cannot add Series 300 machines to our cluster, because we have no 68K binaries for them to load over the network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how you do get Series 300 binaries on a Series 700 machine? You insert the Series 300 Core OS disk (not the bootable Install disk), and you install HP-UX 9 for Series 300. Over the top of the existing install.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is profoundly weird and when I first tried this, I was sure I was doing something wrong and that I was about to trash my whole machine. You can imagine my surprise when, having done this second install (of an alien architecture), the Model 705 carried on working. I could even reboot it. Not only that, but now I was now able to add an S300 machine to my cluster too. I simply specifyied the Ethernet MAC address of my Model 340, along with a hostname (which it used to pick up the IP address from DNS, which was nice), and that was that. All configured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can further imagine my surprise when I connected the Model 340 to Model 705 with my new 10base2 cable (and T-pieces and terminators) and it boots right up, into HP-UX 9 for 68K, over the network. The root password is the same root password I have set up on the Model 705. In fact, it's the same root filesystem. I can make a file on the 340 and see it on the 705, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ uname -a
HP-UX hp340 B.09.10 A 9000/340 080009034425 two-user license

$ echo "this is a test" &amp;gt; /tmp/test
$ cat /tmp/test
this is a test
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And on the other machine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ uname -a
HP-UX hp705 A.09.07 A 9000/705 2001450354 two-user license

$ cat /tmp/test
this is a test
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, binaries (like &lt;code&gt;/bin/ls&lt;/code&gt;) are PA-RISC code on the 705 and 68K code on the 340. I know this, because the binaries work on each machine, but I can see this using the &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 705:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ file /bin/ls
/bin/ls:        s800 shared executable
$ ls -l /bin/ls
-r-xr-xr-x   6 bin      bin       172032 Jun  9  1995 /bin/ls
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 340:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ file /bin/ls
/bin/ls:        s200 demand-load executable -version 2
$ ls -l /bin/ls
-r-xr-xr-x   6 bin      bin       143360 Feb 27  1995 /bin/ls
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are not the same file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So ... they have mounted the same filesystem but the filesystem contents are different. What on earth is going on? How is one file both a 68K binary and a PA-RISC binary at the same time? But other files are just the same file?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might think it's the NEXTSTEP trick of so-called fat binaries (as inherited by MacOS X and modern macOS). But look - the file sizes and timestamps don't match. So it's not one file with two binaries inside it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have bad news. That 20 minutes of thrashing when we set up cluster mode? We created ourselves a Context Dependent Filesystem. The contents of our filesystem are literally context-dependent. And the context comes from the machine you are logged in to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Context Dependent Filesystems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we get to the point of the blog post. This filesystem is wild and I can totally see why HP ditched it in HP-UX 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a file is a context-dependent file (or CDF), it in fact becomes a directory. Within this directory are files named after the various supported contexts. When you access the filename, you get the contents according to the context you are in. But when you access the filename including a &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; character at the end, you can see the directory and the context-dependent files it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Directories can also be context-dependent and when that happens, each entry it contains is a directory for a specific context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;code&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ ls -ld /bin
drwxr-xr-x   3 root     root        2048 May 23  1995 /bin
$ ls -ld /bin+
drwsr-xr-x   4 root     root        1024 May 23  1995 /bin+

-r-xr-xr-x   6 bin      bin       143360 Feb 27  1995 /bin+/HP-MC68020/ls
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh look, our two copies of &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;! It appears the context for the Series 700 files is &lt;code&gt;HP-PA&lt;/code&gt; and the context for the Series 300 files is &lt;code&gt;HP-MC68020&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Side note: Don't worry about the dates - I moved the clock forward from the default of 1995 to 1997 before installing the 68K version because I got warnings on boot-up that files were newer than the current date/time)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They use this system even if you don't have a mixed-architecture cluster. There are some config files in &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; where the context is the hostname of the machine that's accessing the file. That way each machine in the cluster can get a unique copy of the config file (like &lt;code&gt;/etc/checklist&lt;/code&gt;) whilst they can all share the same copy of some files (like &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt;, which is not a CDF).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Files you create whilst using the system will just be regular files - if you want to create a CDF, you must use the &lt;code&gt;makecdf&lt;/code&gt; command. This turns out to be important because we need to fix a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fixing X11R5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you try and run the VUE desktop on the Model 340 on this version of HP-UX, when booted from a Series 700 server running that version of HP-UX, the X11 server will fail to start. This is due to a missing library called &lt;code&gt;libSXR5.sl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a lot of poking around online and finding extremely little about this file, I worked out that this because the &lt;code&gt;X11-SERV&lt;/code&gt; package did not install correctly when we installed HP-UX for Series 300. Looking at &lt;code&gt;/tmp/update.log&lt;/code&gt; we see:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;       * Beginning customize script for fileset "X11-SERV" (163 of 174) using 
         the command:  /system+/HP-MC68020/X11-SERV/customize HP-MC68020
cp: cannot create /usr/lib/X11/extensions/libSXR5.sl+/HP-MC68020: No such file or directory
NOTE:  couldn't copy /etc/newconfig+/HP-MC68020/X11R5/libSXR5.sl to 
       /usr/lib/X11/extensions/libSXR5.sl+/HP-MC68020
ERROR:   Customize script for fileset "X11-SERV" failed.  You might want to 
         re-invoke it manually later.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's interesting. It's trying to put the Series 300 file into a context called &lt;code&gt;HP-MC68020&lt;/code&gt; but it cannot. Does that CDF exist? No it does not. But there is a file called &lt;code&gt;libSXR5A.sl&lt;/code&gt;, which is not a CDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that this because in HP-UX 9.07 for Series 700, the library is called &lt;code&gt;libSXR5A.sl&lt;/code&gt;. My theory is that they updated it at some point and figured it needed a new name. However, when we installed HP-UX 9.10 for Series 300, it still thinks the library is called &lt;code&gt;libSXR5.sl&lt;/code&gt;, and it tries to install it to an existing CDF of that name, which does not exist. Therefore the installation of the &lt;code&gt;X11-SERV&lt;/code&gt; package fails and that file ends up missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workaround is to create the CDF manually, and then retry the installation of that package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ makecdf /usr/lib/X11/extensions/libSXR5.sl
$ /system+/HP-MC68020/X11-SERV/customize HP-MC68020
NOTE: copying /etc/newconfig+/HP-MC68020/X11R5/libSXR5.sl to /usr/lib/X11/extensions/libSXR5.sl+/HP-MC68020
$ ls -l /usr/lib/X11/extensions/libSXR5.sl+
total 36
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root     sys        18262 Nov  9 18:22 HP-MC68020
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you ever try to replicate this setup, I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we have the file, and we can run X11R5 and the VUE desktop on our 68K UNIX workstation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You want to see the original version of the Sega classic Columns, running on a 68K UNIX workstation from 1989, in glorious 1280x1024 8-bit colour?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out it was written by HP employee Jay Geertsen, and shipped as a game/demo in HP-UX. Sega later licensed it from the author, and you might remember playing it in the Arcade or on the Sega Mega Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But do you want to play this game, on this hardware? Then come to the Retro Computer Festival, 15-16 November 2026 at the Centre for Computing History. I'll be there with these two monsters, along with a few more HPs, my SGI Power Indigo 2, and a few Sun workstations for good measure. Tickets are available from https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/ and are selling fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you'd like more details about HP-UX in Cluster Mode, Bitsavers have a copy of Managing Clusters of HP 9000 Computers: Sharing the HP-UX Filesystem, along with many other interesting documents about HP-UX. Definitely worth taking a look.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Europe to decide if 6 GHz is shared between Wi-Fi and cellular networks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Two different groups want this valuable spectrum, but can they share?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A row is brewing in Europe over the 6 GHz part of the wireless spectrum, between those who believe it should be licensed for use by cellular networks and others that want it reserved for Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Wi-Fi Alliance and the Dynamic Spectrum Alliance (DSA) have published open letters addressed to "EU digital ministers," expressing concerns that the upper 6 GHz band (6425 to 7125 MHz) may be rendered off-limits to Wi-Fi networks in European Union countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the heart of the problem is that newer Wi-Fi standards such as Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 are capable of using frequencies in the entire 6 GHz band to provide greater performance. But mobile operators are also eyeing this band for 5G and 6G network services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG) of the European Commission is currently exploring ways of sharing the upper 6 GHz band between license-exempt technologies such as Wi-Fi and mobile networks. The lower part of the band is already license-exempt. Britain's telco regulator Ofcom is following a similar policy, after a consultation process in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the Wi-Fi camp is worried that the German government may have changed its stance to favor exclusive mobile network use of the upper 6 GHz band, potentially influencing the RSPG's decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport told German news site Heise Online: "The frequency requirements of mobile network operators in the upper 6 GHz band are assessed as greater with a view to future 6G applications" than those of Wi-Fi applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apartment living to get worse in 5 years as 6 GHz Wi-Fi nears 'exhaustion'&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trump's budget bill opens wide swath of spectrum for sale&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EchoStar secures rights to spectrum it plans to sell to SpaceX&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EchoStar sells off its spectrum for more than its total market cap&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response, the Wi-Fi Alliance and the DSA are trying to stoke fears that such a move would severely dent Europe's digital development, claiming Wi-Fi is the primary way consumers access the internet and constraining it would impact progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Blocking Wi-Fi access to the upper 6 GHz band would be devastating to the future of Wi-Fi technology in Europe. This spectrum is uniquely positioned to sustain the evolution of the Wi-Fi ecosystem and enable the next generation of digital innovation," said the DSA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DSA styles itself as a global body advocating for regulations that will deliver more efficient spectrum use, but its member list appears to consist chiefly of US tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Broadcom, and Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Wi-Fi Alliance complained that its members were working with the RSPG's proposals to try and use the spectrum on a shared basis, in line with the European Commission's mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"By contrast, the mobile industry is arguing against a compromise. It is now demanding exclusive use of the entire upper 6 GHz band for mobile services, arguing this would strengthen Europe's digital sovereignty," its letter states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It claims that Wi-Fi has access to "significantly less spectrum than mobile. These traffic patterns show Wi-Fi's need for the upper 6 GHz band far exceeds that of mobile."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mobile telecoms industry sees it differently, of course. Vodafone has previously conducted tests in the upper 6 GHz frequencies, achieving download speeds of up to 5 Gbps, and saying it should be made available to boost cellular capacity when current bandwidth becomes exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nokia and Swedish telco Telia also carried out a pilot deployment using the upper 6 GHz spectrum last year, claiming it showed the ability to add "massive capacity" in built-up areas, while high throughput can be achieved in suburban or rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this respect, the mobile industry has backing from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which earmarked the upper 6 GHz band for cellular services at the World Radio Conference (WRC) in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the US telco regulator the FCC reserved the entire 6 GHz band for Wi-Fi and other unlicensed operations back in 2020. Other countries are not prevented from following their own path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All eyes will be on the RSPG's next Plenary Meeting on November 12, to see what decision (if any) it adopts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson at the European Commission sent a statement to The Register:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The Commission envisages a technical harmonisation decision on the upper 6 GHz band.To this end, the Commission has tasked the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) to develop EU-harmonised technical conditions for a preferred usage scenario of the band. The CEPT has to deliver its final report in July 2027." ®&lt;/p&gt;
