        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Greetings of the day. I used sci-hub to download papers for my research work many times. Thanks for providing this free platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

I can't describe how grateful each and every researcher is to your wonderful work as SCI-HUB. Thank you again for freeing students like us from the web of subscriptions that costs more than our own fellowships. Please let me know how I can contribute if possible from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a native speaker of Tamil (Oldest language). Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you.

        &lt;p&gt;It feels so nice to have guys like you in science community. I read about you today while downloading a paper. I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care! May almighty fulfills whatever you aspire in life!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;HI, alexandra you did good work , which is helpful for students, especially the student who can not pay for paper. I am phd candidate. i am about to submit my thesis. your website helped me a lot. Thanking you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you. Thank you for providing us Sci-hub. This is of immense help to academicians like you. I am a teacher, University Professor. It is not possible for me to pay for each and every article. Moreover I do lots of editorial activities for free. Only because of you we are gaining access to whatever we need for our academic purposes. All the best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a master's student in Mathematics from India and I wanted to write to you to express my gratitude for your creation - Sci-hub. I've been using Sci-hub since the last 3-4 years (or even earlier) and whenever I wasn't a part of an institution, it was impossible for me to access material through official repositories ( I never have enough money XD). So I wanted to explicitly write to you my sincere thanks for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

This day is celebrated as a "day of mother" in my home. This "day of mother" is to remind us that each and every female, outside or inside our home must be respected as we respect our mother.

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Subhendu Samanta&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth.

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the sci-hub website that made research possible for me without going bankrupt! Sci-hub has played a valuable role in my education. Thank you so much for your efforts!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a researcher from India. I just wanted to thank you for the great initiative you have taken. I can't describe how grateful each and every researcher is to your wonderful work as SCI-HUB. Thank you again for freeing students like us from the web of subscriptions that costs more than our own fellowships. Please let me know how I can contribute if possible from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Actually this is too late to express my heartfelt thanks to you because you made the research process easy for all researchers like me. You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

My institute doesn't subscribe to lot of journals and in India, it is seen that state expenditure on the public education is decreasing. In this neo-liberal times, your work actually helps in fighting the inequalities in society. Now, I cannot imagine my work without a science hub. Thank you for all the work.

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;HI, alexandra you did good work , which is helpful for students, especially the student who can not pay for paper. I am phd candidate. i am about to submit my thesis. your website helped me a lot. Thanking you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Heera Jayan&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tapas Ray&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you. Thank you for providing us Sci-hub. This is of immense help to academicians like you. I am a teacher, University Professor. It is not possible for me to pay for each and every article. Moreover I do lots of editorial activities for free. Only because of you we are gaining access to whatever we need for our academic purposes. All the best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a master's student in Mathematics from India and I wanted to write to you to express my gratitude for your creation - Sci-hub. I've been using Sci-hub since the last 3-4 years (or even earlier) and whenever I wasn't a part of an institution, it was impossible for me to access material through official repositories ( I never have enough money XD). So I wanted to explicitly write to you my sincere thanks for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

Keep coming up with such amazing ideas and make this world a better place. Wishing you all the best and success.&lt;/p&gt;

This day is celebrated as a "day of mother" in my home. This "day of mother" is to remind us that each and every female, outside or inside our home must be respected as we respect our mother. And today I saw your gif with waving hands. That gif gave me a feeling that you are with us forever like my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Subhendu Samanta&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a researcher from India. I just wanted to thank you for the great initiative you have taken. I can't describe how grateful each and every researcher is to your wonderful work as SCI-HUB. Thank you again for freeing students like us from the web of subscriptions that costs more than our own fellowships. Please let me know how I can contribute if possible from India.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Actually this is too late to express my heartfelt thanks to you because you made the research process easy for all researchers like me. You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

My institute doesn't subscribe to lot of journals and in India, it is seen that state expenditure on the public education is decreasing. In this neo-liberal times, your work actually helps in fighting the inequalities in society. Now, I cannot imagine my work without a science hub. Thank you for all the work.

        &lt;p&gt;Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I have been doing research since my graduation days. This Sci-hub helped me alot. Thanks for helping us. Today is the day of SHAILPUTRI DEVI in INDIA. This day is celebrated as a "day of mother" in my home. This "day of mother" is to remind us that each and every female, outside or inside our home must be respected as we respect our mother. And today I saw your gif with waving hands. That gif gave me a feeling that you are with us forever like my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am so grateful to you for launching SCI hub. I belong to a financially lower genre and could not afford purchasing articles to continue my research. I struggle a lot even to pay my PhD fees. But you have really laid a platform which helped me a lot to again knowledge regarding recent research. Thank you so much for your contribution to the world. &lt;/p&gt;

I also understand your pain and problems during re-opening another website when one closes. Our institute does not have much access to journals. Your help is highly appreciated. I completely agree with your mission- "No barriers in the field of knowledge" You may surprise that we use to give your name in "thank you" page of most group meeting and any thesis viva-voce. 💛great love from India💛&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a researcher in Botany from India. Related to my studies I have to access several publications, the majority are on payment. I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

My institute doesn't subscribe to lot of journals and in India, it is seen that state expenditure on the public education is decreasing. In this neo-liberal times, your work actually helps in fighting the inequalities in society. Now, I cannot imagine my work without a science hub. Thank you for all the work.

        &lt;p&gt;Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am really happy to see you and your profile on Sci-hub. You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care!

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;Thanks for such great website you build for research works. Really appreciate it, and grateful. It saves a lot of time and money, especially for those who came from small and mid size college and universities with limited resources. I am using it from last 2 years, for research work in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Do keep it up. Happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am really happy to see you and your profile on Sci-hub. You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care!

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake. Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thanks for such great website you build for research works. Really appreciate it, and grateful. It saves a lot of time and money, especially for those who came from small and mid size college and universities with limited resources. I am using it from last 2 years, for research work in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Do keep it up. Happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I saw your message on the sci-hub.se regarding interest for neuro research and religion and culture. Hence wanted to show appreciation for your work and thought. Thank you once again for giving us sci hub a platform for true knowledge and the genuinity in gaining knowledge for the aspirants who come from a poor background. Thanks a lot.👍👍&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a native speaker of Tamil (Oldest language). Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care! May almighty fulfills whatever you aspire in life!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you Alexandra for the fantastic work you do in keeping Scihub alive. I am morally conflicted in using the services but I have other option as access to these papers is prohibitively expensive for small not-for-profit entities like my own organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you.I am doing PhD and had it not been for you, conducting research, searching for articles and references would have been very difficult. It has made things easier.I think your efforts to make information accessible to all should be recognized and lauded. I just hope that somehow, someday you are able to you gain the respect your efforts deserve. On my part, I am grateful to you and love you for being there!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this mail to give you a vote of thanks! for managing the platform for the scholar so that we can download the information and could use it for the benefit of mankind by exploring the research. Last week I was surfing of net and I found that Elsevier has sued you in court. I don't know how can I contribute to you but I am with you. I hope the best for you!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;Thanks for such great website you build for research works. Really appreciate it, and grateful. It saves a lot of time and money, especially for those who came from small and mid size college and universities with limited resources. I am using it from last 2 years, for research work in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Do keep it up. Happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am extremely happy and I appreciate your efforts for Sci-hub activities. Because of your hard work, in Sci-hub I am able to complete my Ph.D. recently. Please do not stop your work in sci-hub, because it's very very useful for low financial researchers/countries.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a student from India pursuing my Master's degree in Pharmacology. Given the lack of funding, buying or renting a research paper was never an option for me. It is the sci-hub website that made research possible for me without going bankrupt! Sci-hub has played a valuable role in my education. Thank you so much for your efforts!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a researcher from India. I just wanted to thank you for the great initiative you have taken. I can't describe how grateful each and every researcher is to your wonderful work as SCI-HUB. Thank you again for freeing students like us from the web of subscriptions that costs more than our own fellowships. Please let me know how I can contribute if possible from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I saw your message on the sci-hub.se regarding interest for neuro research and religion and culture. Hence wanted to show appreciation for your work and thought. Thank you once again for giving us sci hub a platform for true knowledge and the genuinity in gaining knowledge for the aspirants who come from a poor background. Thanks a lot.👍👍&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a native speaker of Tamil (Oldest language). Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It feels so nice to have guys like you in science community. I read about you today while downloading a paper. I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care! May almighty fulfills whatever you aspire in life!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Dr. Mukul Dave from India. I am M.Sc., Ph.D., I did my research in organic chemistry on synthesis of various drugs. We checked its potency for anti tubercular, anti bacterial and Local anesthetic drugs. I always refer research articles on Sci-Hub and I find what ever I want. I am presently interested natural herbs useful for the eye medicine preparation. I have developed Herbal formulation in the form of film coated tablets under nutraceutical head. your articles on sci-hub is very useful to me.&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you so much for providing us with so many scientific articles. It wouldn't have been possible for me to gain knowledge without Sci-hub. Certainly, you are an inspiration for us.

        &lt;p&gt;For my master's program I need to keep reading research papers and couldn't access them thanks to paywall. My classmates told me about your website and now, obviously, I can access them. So thank you for your brilliant website. I went through your profile and it is very interesting. Your passion for learning is quite inspiring as well. I wrote this mail to thank you for the website. It is amazing, THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN!!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you Alexandra for the fantastic work you do in keeping Scihub alive. I am morally conflicted in using the services but I have other option as access to these papers is prohibitively expensive for small not-for-profit entities like my own organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you.I am doing PhD and had it not been for you, conducting research, searching for articles and references would have been very difficult. It has made things easier.I think your efforts to make information accessible to all should be recognized and lauded. I just hope that somehow, someday you are able to you gain the respect your efforts deserve. On my part, I am grateful to you and love you for being there!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been using Sci-hub since the last 3-4 years (or even earlier) and whenever I wasn't a part of an institution, it was impossible for me to access material through official repositories ( I never have enough money XD). So I wanted to explicitly write to you my sincere thanks for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings of the day. I used sci-hub to download papers for my research work many times. Thanks for providing this free platform.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I saw your message on the sci-hub.se regarding interest for neuro research and religion and culture. Hence wanted to show appreciation for your work and thought. Thank you once again for giving us sci hub a platform for true knowledge and the genuinity in gaining knowledge for the aspirants who come from a poor background. Thanks a lot.👍👍&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a native speaker of Tamil (Oldest language). Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It feels so nice to have guys like you in science community. I read about you today while downloading a paper. I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care! May almighty fulfills whatever you aspire in life!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;HI, alexandra you did good work , which is helpful for students, especially the student who can not pay for paper. I am phd candidate. i am about to submit my thesis. your website helped me a lot. Thanking you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you.I am doing PhD and had it not been for you, conducting research, searching for articles and references would have been very difficult. It has made things easier.I think your efforts to make information accessible to all should be recognized and lauded. I just hope that somehow, someday you are able to you gain the respect your efforts deserve. On my part, I am grateful to you and love you for being there!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you. Thank you for providing us Sci-hub. This is of immense help to academicians like you. I am a teacher, University Professor. It is not possible for me to pay for each and every article. Moreover I do lots of editorial activities for free. Only because of you we are gaining access to whatever we need for our academic purposes. All the best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a master's student in Mathematics from India and I wanted to write to you to express my gratitude for your creation - Sci-hub. I've been using Sci-hub since the last 3-4 years (or even earlier) and whenever I wasn't a part of an institution, it was impossible for me to access material through official repositories ( I never have enough money XD). So I wanted to explicitly write to you my sincere thanks for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

This day is celebrated as a "day of mother" in my home. This "day of mother" is to remind us that each and every female, outside or inside our home must be respected as we respect our mother. And today I saw your gif with waving hands. That gif gave me a feeling that you are with us forever like my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a student from India pursuing my Master's degree in Pharmacology. Given the lack of funding, buying or renting a research paper was never an option for me. It is the sci-hub website that made research possible for me without going bankrupt! Sci-hub has played a valuable role in my education. Thank you so much for your efforts!&lt;/p&gt;

I can't describe how grateful each and every researcher is to your wonderful work as SCI-HUB. Thank you again for freeing students like us from the web of subscriptions that costs more than our own fellowships. Please let me know how I can contribute if possible from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Actually this is too late to express my heartfelt thanks to you because you made the research process easy for all researchers like me. You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a researcher from India and been using your work for accessing and studying scientific literature since I got into research. I only wanted to tell you that I am a big fan of your work and admired reading about you and your ideology. You have done a great service to scientific community. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It feels so nice to have guys like you in science community. I read about you today while downloading a paper. I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care! May almighty fulfills whatever you aspire in life!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;HI, alexandra you did good work , which is helpful for students, especially the student who can not pay for paper. I am phd candidate. i am about to submit my thesis. your website helped me a lot. Thanking you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you. Thank you for providing us Sci-hub. This is of immense help to academicians like you. I am a teacher, University Professor. It is not possible for me to pay for each and every article. Moreover I do lots of editorial activities for free. Only because of you we are gaining access to whatever we need for our academic purposes. All the best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a master's student in Mathematics from India and I wanted to write to you to express my gratitude for your creation - Sci-hub. I've been using Sci-hub since the last 3-4 years (or even earlier) and whenever I wasn't a part of an institution, it was impossible for me to access material through official repositories ( I never have enough money XD). So I wanted to explicitly write to you my sincere thanks for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

This day is celebrated as a "day of mother" in my home. This "day of mother" is to remind us that each and every female, outside or inside our home must be respected as we respect our mother. And today I saw your gif with waving hands. That gif gave me a feeling that you are with us forever like my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a researcher from India. I just wanted to thank you for the great initiative you have taken. I can't describe how grateful each and every researcher is to your wonderful work as SCI-HUB. Thank you again for freeing students like us from the web of subscriptions that costs more than our own fellowships. Please let me know how I can contribute if possible from India.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Actually this is too late to express my heartfelt thanks to you because you made the research process easy for all researchers like me. You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

My institute doesn't subscribe to lot of journals and in India, it is seen that state expenditure on the public education is decreasing. In this neo-liberal times, your work actually helps in fighting the inequalities in society. Now, I cannot imagine my work without a science hub. Thank you for all the work.

        &lt;p&gt;Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I have been doing research since my graduation days. This Sci-hub helped me alot. Thanks for helping us. Today is the day of SHAILPUTRI DEVI in INDIA. This day is celebrated as a "day of mother" in my home. This "day of mother" is to remind us that each and every female, outside or inside our home must be respected as we respect our mother. And today I saw your gif with waving hands. That gif gave me a feeling that you are with us forever like my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a newbie Neurosurgeon from India. I have completed my Neurosurgery from India's dedicated neurosciences centre at Bangalore. NIMHANS - National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences. This institute was established way back in 1923 as dedicated psychiatry hospital. Today this institute is apex centre in India for Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. I did my thesis on studying neural network in Epilepsy patients using DTI MRI scans. It is very grateful that you have created this Sci-Hub website.&lt;/p&gt;

I am so grateful to you for launching SCI hub. I belong to a financially lower genre and could not afford purchasing articles to continue my research. I struggle a lot even to pay my PhD fees. But you have really laid a platform which helped me a lot to again knowledge regarding recent research. Thank you so much for your contribution to the world. &lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Actually this is too late to express my heartfelt thanks to you because you made the research process easy for all researchers like me. You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

My institute doesn't subscribe to lot of journals and in India, it is seen that state expenditure on the public education is decreasing. In this neo-liberal times, your work actually helps in fighting the inequalities in society. Now, I cannot imagine my work without a science hub. Thank you for all the work.

        &lt;p&gt;Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am really happy to see you and your profile on Sci-hub. You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care!

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;Thanks for such great website you build for research works. Really appreciate it, and grateful. It saves a lot of time and money, especially for those who came from small and mid size college and universities with limited resources. I am using it from last 2 years, for research work in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Do keep it up. Happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a student from India pursuing my Master's degree in Pharmacology. Given the lack of funding, buying or renting a research paper was never an option for me.

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a doctoral candidate who has enrolled in a public university in India. My institute doesn't subscribe to lot of journals and in India, it is seen that state expenditure on the public education is decreasing. In this neo-liberal times, your work actually helps in fighting the inequalities in society. Now, I cannot imagine my work without a science hub. Thank you for all the work. Another communist here.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am really happy to see you and your profile on Sci-hub. You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care!

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;Thanks for such great website you build for research works. Really appreciate it, and grateful. It saves a lot of time and money, especially for those who came from small and mid size college and universities with limited resources. I am using it from last 2 years, for research work in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Do keep it up. Happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care!

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you.I am doing PhD and had it not been for you, conducting research, searching for articles and references would have been very difficult. It has made things easier.I think your efforts to make information accessible to all should be recognized and lauded. I just hope that somehow, someday you are able to you gain the respect your efforts deserve. On my part, I am grateful to you and love you for being there!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We are a small start up in India. We are grateful to you for the wonderful work that you have done. We have meager resources but would still like to help you. We would like to contribute $ 1008 to your project. I know it is not much but we hope to contribute more as we grow. Please do let us know how we can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all, thank you very much for your kind help to research scholer like me who can't afford a highly paid general. It has been in the news that this website is supposed to be close after 7th January so let me know that after closing form where we can free scientific article.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this mail to give you a vote of thanks! for managing the platform for the scholar so that we can download the information and could use it for the benefit of mankind by exploring the research. Last week I was surfing of net and I found that Elsevier has sued you in court. I don't know how can I contribute to you but I am with you. I hope the best for you!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;Thanks for such great website you build for research works. Really appreciate it, and grateful. It saves a lot of time and money, especially for those who came from small and mid size college and universities with limited resources. I am using it from last 2 years, for research work in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Do keep it up. Happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I saw your message on the sci-hub.se regarding interest for neuro research and religion and culture. Hence wanted to show appreciation for your work and thought. Thank you once again for giving us sci hub a platform for true knowledge and the genuinity in gaining knowledge for the aspirants who come from a poor background. Thanks a lot.👍👍&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a native speaker of Tamil (Oldest language). Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care! May almighty fulfills whatever you aspire in life!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;For my master's program I need to keep reading research papers and couldn't access them thanks to paywall. My classmates told me about your website and now, obviously, I can access them. So thank you for your brilliant website. I went through your profile and it is very interesting. Your passion for learning is quite inspiring as well. I wrote this mail to thank you for the website. It is amazing, THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN!!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you Alexandra for the fantastic work you do in keeping Scihub alive. I am morally conflicted in using the services but I have other option as access to these papers is prohibitively expensive for small not-for-profit entities like my own organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you.I am doing PhD and had it not been for you, conducting research, searching for articles and references would have been very difficult. It has made things easier.I think your efforts to make information accessible to all should be recognized and lauded. I just hope that somehow, someday you are able to you gain the respect your efforts deserve. On my part, I am grateful to you and love you for being there!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been using Sci-hub since the last 3-4 years (or even earlier) and whenever I wasn't a part of an institution, it was impossible for me to access material through official repositories ( I never have enough money XD). So I wanted to explicitly write to you my sincere thanks for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this mail to give you a vote of thanks! for managing the platform for the scholar so that we can download the information and could use it for the benefit of mankind by exploring the research. Last week I was surfing of net and I found that Elsevier has sued you in court. I don't know how can I contribute to you but I am with you. I hope the best for you!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings of the day. I used sci-hub to download papers for my research work many times. Thanks for providing this free platform.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a postgraduate in psychiatry from India. I would like to thank you for your website without which the information for my dissertation would have been incomplete and difficult. I saw your message on the sci-hub.se regarding interest for neuro research and religion and culture. Hence wanted to show appreciation for your work and thought. Thank you once again for giving us sci hub a platform for true knowledge and the genuinity in gaining knowledge for the aspirants who come from a poor background. Thanks a lot.👍👍&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a native speaker of Tamil (Oldest language). Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It feels so nice to have guys like you in science community. I read about you today while downloading a paper. I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care! May almighty fulfills whatever you aspire in life!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;HI, alexandra you did good work , which is helpful for students, especially the student who can not pay for paper. I am phd candidate. i am about to submit my thesis. your website helped me a lot. Thanking you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you Alexandra for the fantastic work you do in keeping Scihub alive. I am morally conflicted in using the services but I have other option as access to these papers is prohibitively expensive for small not-for-profit entities like my own organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you.I am doing PhD and had it not been for you, conducting research, searching for articles and references would have been very difficult. It has made things easier.I think your efforts to make information accessible to all should be recognized and lauded. I just hope that somehow, someday you are able to you gain the respect your efforts deserve. On my part, I am grateful to you and love you for being there!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you. Thank you for providing us Sci-hub. This is of immense help to academicians like you. I am a teacher, University Professor. It is not possible for me to pay for each and every article. Moreover I do lots of editorial activities for free. Only because of you we are gaining access to whatever we need for our academic purposes. All the best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a master's student in Mathematics from India and I wanted to write to you to express my gratitude for your creation - Sci-hub. I've been using Sci-hub since the last 3-4 years (or even earlier) and whenever I wasn't a part of an institution, it was impossible for me to access material through official repositories ( I never have enough money XD). So I wanted to explicitly write to you my sincere thanks for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

This day is celebrated as a "day of mother" in my home. This "day of mother" is to remind us that each and every female, outside or inside our home must be respected as we respect our mother. And today I saw your gif with waving hands. That gif gave me a feeling that you are with us forever like my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings of the day. I used sci-hub to download papers for my research work many times. Thanks for providing this free platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

I can't describe how grateful each and every researcher is to your wonderful work as SCI-HUB. Thank you again for freeing students like us from the web of subscriptions that costs more than our own fellowships. Please let me know how I can contribute if possible from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It feels so nice to have guys like you in science community. I read about you today while downloading a paper. I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care! May almighty fulfills whatever you aspire in life!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;HI, alexandra you did good work , which is helpful for students, especially the student who can not pay for paper. I am phd candidate. i am about to submit my thesis. your website helped me a lot. Thanking you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you. Thank you for providing us Sci-hub. This is of immense help to academicians like you. I am a teacher, University Professor. It is not possible for me to pay for each and every article. Moreover I do lots of editorial activities for free. Only because of you we are gaining access to whatever we need for our academic purposes. All the best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a master's student in Mathematics from India and I wanted to write to you to express my gratitude for your creation - Sci-hub. I've been using Sci-hub since the last 3-4 years (or even earlier) and whenever I wasn't a part of an institution, it was impossible for me to access material through official repositories ( I never have enough money XD). So I wanted to explicitly write to you my sincere thanks for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

This day is celebrated as a "day of mother" in my home. This "day of mother" is to remind us that each and every female, outside or inside our home must be respected as we respect our mother. And today I saw your gif with waving hands. That gif gave me a feeling that you are with us forever like my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a researcher from India. I just wanted to thank you for the great initiative you have taken. I can't describe how grateful each and every researcher is to your wonderful work as SCI-HUB. Thank you again for freeing students like us from the web of subscriptions that costs more than our own fellowships. Please let me know how I can contribute if possible from India.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Actually this is too late to express my heartfelt thanks to you because you made the research process easy for all researchers like me. You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

My institute doesn't subscribe to lot of journals and in India, it is seen that state expenditure on the public education is decreasing. In this neo-liberal times, your work actually helps in fighting the inequalities in society. Now, I cannot imagine my work without a science hub. Thank you for all the work.

        &lt;p&gt;Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a master's student in Mathematics from India and I wanted to write to you to express my gratitude for your creation - Sci-hub. I've been using Sci-hub since the last 3-4 years (or even earlier) and whenever I wasn't a part of an institution, it was impossible for me to access material through official repositories ( I never have enough money XD). So I wanted to explicitly write to you my sincere thanks for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you from the bottom of my heart for creating the website sci-hub. It has been a life saviour to me and a lot of people I know. Keep coming up with such amazing ideas and make this world a better place. Wishing you all the best and success.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I have been doing research since my graduation days. This Sci-hub helped me alot. Thanks for helping us. Today is the day of SHAILPUTRI DEVI in INDIA. This day is celebrated as a "day of mother" in my home. This "day of mother" is to remind us that each and every female, outside or inside our home must be respected as we respect our mother. And today I saw your gif with waving hands. That gif gave me a feeling that you are with us forever like my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I always wondering about sci-hub and its founder. Now, I could see you and I am so happy to see you. I don't know how to express my sincere gratitude to you. I just got doctoral degree with the help of your great great work. Thanks a lot. Love from India.&lt;/p&gt;

I cannot imagine my research without Sci-hub. Most importantly I cannot afford the money the journals are demanding. We people always love your Sci-hub. You know I sent, some small donation to Sci-hub. Like me, there are thousand and thousand poor researchers are always praise you for your noble work. Kindly if any help is needed, you post. We will be ready to serve for your sincere works. We people are always with you on your side. Kindly acknowledge my wishes and thanks. God bless you and I pray for your peace and health. Long live Sci-hub. Long live Alexandra Elbakyan.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you again for freeing students like us from the web of subscriptions that costs more than our own fellowships. Please let me know how I can contribute if possible from India.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Actually this is too late to express my heartfelt thanks to you because you made the research process easy for all researchers like me. You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article. You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality. I came to know that you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

My institute doesn't subscribe to lot of journals and in India, it is seen that state expenditure on the public education is decreasing. In this neo-liberal times, your work actually helps in fighting the inequalities in society. Now, I cannot imagine my work without a science hub. Thank you for all the work.

        &lt;p&gt;Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am really happy to see you and your profile on Sci-hub. You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care!

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub.

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

This day is celebrated as a "day of mother" in my home. This "day of mother" is to remind us that each and every female, outside or inside our home must be respected as we respect our mother. And today I saw your gif with waving hands. That gif gave me a feeling that you are with us forever like my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I also understand your pain and problems during re-opening another website when one closes. Our institute does not have much access to journals. Your help is highly appreciated. I completely agree with your mission- "No barriers in the field of knowledge" You may surprise that we use to give your name in "thank you" page of most group meeting and any thesis viva-voce. 💛great love from India💛&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a researcher in Botany from India. Related to my studies I have to access several publications, the majority are on payment. I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries.. 😍😘😍😍😍&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a doctoral candidate who has enrolled in a public university in India. My institute doesn't subscribe to lot of journals and in India, it is seen that state expenditure on the public education is decreasing. In this neo-liberal times, your work actually helps in fighting the inequalities in society. Now, I cannot imagine my work without a science hub. Thank you for all the work.

        &lt;p&gt;Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am really happy to see you and your profile on Sci-hub. You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care!

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        &lt;p&gt;Thanks for such great website you build for research works. Really appreciate it, and grateful. It saves a lot of time and money, especially for those who came from small and mid size college and universities with limited resources. I am using it from last 2 years, for research work in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Do keep it up. Happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I am really happy to see you and your profile on Sci-hub. You made my work simpler and easier because whenever I have a problem in accessing or downloading research articles, imminently I use to surf on Sci-hub and recommend it to my friends circle. Because of your website so many researches are benefitted in India, especially those who don't have the journal subscription or standard journals. Keep going Thanks a lot for your help&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care!

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for all your selfless work bringing science to seekers; you are my Goddess Saraswati! But for your Sci-Hub, I wouldn't have been able to do my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for creating such an amazing service, without sci-hub I could not imagine how difficult would it be to research on neuroscience and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am writing this email to show my kindest appreciation for your hard work that you did for all of us. I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We are a small start up in India. We are grateful to you for the wonderful work that you have done. We have meager resources but would still like to help you. We would like to contribute $ 1008 to your project. I know it is not much but we hope to contribute more as we grow. Please do let us know how we can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all, thank you very much for your kind help to research scholer like me who can't afford a highly paid general. It has been in the news that this website is supposed to be close after 7th January so let me know that after closing form where we can free scientific article.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am very new in the field of scientific research. And I am not sure in which area I am going to work. But I know one thing for sure, whichever area I go to, it would not be possible without your help. Love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Mayank Singh, assistant professor at Parul University, India. I am writing this mail to give you a vote of thanks! for managing the platform for the scholar so that we can download the information and could use it for the benefit of mankind by exploring the research. Last week I was surfing of net and I found that Elsevier has sued you in court. I don't know how can I contribute to you but I am with you. I hope the best for you!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;
