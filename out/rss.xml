  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After years of staring down the world’s biggest tech companies and setting the bar for tough regulation worldwide, Europe has blinked. Under intense pressure from industry and the US government, Brussels is stripping protections from its flagship General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — including simplifying its infamous cookie permission pop-ups — and relaxing or delaying landmark AI rules in an effort to cut red tape and revive sluggish economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Europe is scaling back its landmark privacy and AI laws&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU folds under Big Tech’s pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU folds under Big Tech’s pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The changes, proposed by the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, changes core elements of the GDPR, making it easier for companies to share anonymized and pseudonymized personal datasets. They would allow AI companies to legally use personal data to train AI models, so long as that training complies with other GDPR requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposal also waters down a key part of Europe’s sweeping artificial intelligence rules, the AI Act, which came into force in 2024 but had many elements that would only come into effect later. The change extends the grace period for rules governing high-risk AI systems that pose “serious risks” to health, safety, or fundamental rights, which were due to come into effect next summer. The rules will now only apply once it’s confirmed that “the needed standards and support tools are available” to AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One change that’s likely to please almost everyone is a reduction in Europe’s ubiquitous cookie banners and pop-ups. Under the new proposal, some “non-risk” cookies won’t trigger pop-ups at all, and users would be able to control others from central browser controls that apply to websites broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other amendments in the new Digital Omnibus include simplified AI documentation requirements for smaller companies, a unified interface for companies to report cybersecurity incidents, and centralizing oversight of AI into the bloc’s AI Office.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is being done in the European way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have all the ingredients in the EU to succeed. But our companies, especially our start-ups and small businesses, are often held back by layers of rigid rules,” said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for tech sovereignty at the European Commission. “By cutting red tape, simplifying EU laws, opening access to data and introducing a common European Business Wallet we are giving space for innovation to happen and to be marketed in Europe. This is being done in the European way: by making sure that fundamental rights of users remain fully protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposal now heads to the European Parliament and the EU’s 27 member states — where it will need a qualified majority — for approval, a process that could drag on for months and potentially introduce significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposed overhaul won’t land quietly in Brussels, and if the development of the GDPR and AI Act are anything to go by, a political and lobbying firestorm is on its way. The GDPR is a cornerstone of Europe’s tech strategy and as close to sacred as a policy can be. Leaked drafts have already provoked outrage among civil rights groups and politicians, who have accused the Commission of weakening fundamental safeguards and bowing to pressure from Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The decision follows months of intense pressure from Big Tech and Donald Trump — as well as high-profile internal figures like ex-Italian prime minister and former head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi — urging the bloc to weaken burdensome tech regulation. The Commission has sought to frame the changes as simplifying the EU’s tech laws, not weakening them – a way of soothing growing fears in Brussels that its tough rules are hampering its ability to compete globally. With very few exceptions, Europe doesn’t have any credible competitors in the global AI race, which is dominated by US and Chinese companies like DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The f32 is an ultra-compact ESP32 development board designed to mount directly behind a USB-C receptacle. The PCB measures just 9.85 mm x 8.45 mm. It's powered by the ESP32-C3FH4 microcontroller and was created primarily for research and as a bit of a stress test for the ESP32, since it intentionally ignores many standard design guidelines. There's only one exposed GPIO and it is connected to an onboard LED, so most of the development on here would be more catered for wifi/web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test the f32 an example application was created that users can interact with. The application turns the f32 into a captive portal so when it's powered on it will show up as an open access point that the user can select from available WiFi networks. The user is then automatically sent to the f32's control page where they can interact with some of its basic functionality such as turning on an LED or scanning for surrounding WiFi networks. There's also an "About" page that provides a small overview of the device. Below are some screenshots and a gif of interacting with the device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially the f32 didn't seem to want to work. I couldn't get it to connect to any networks or broadcast it's own network. Im 100% sure this is due to the poor antenna circuitry or lack of, but I did manage to get it functional after adding an additional tiny antenna onto the chip antenna as seen in the picture below. This was just a piece of bent wire soldered to the end lead and floating above the first lead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I don't have fancy signal testing equipment I relied on some manual testing such as seeing if I can still connect to the device and control the LED. In a clear line of sight test with the f32 placed about 3ft off the ground I was able to connect and perform scans/control the LED at roughly 120ft! This can be seen in my highly necessary depiction below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PCB was designed using DipTrace and manufactured by PCBWay with a board thickness of 0.6mm, min hole size of 0.2mm, and min track/spacing of 4/4mil. At the time of making this it only cost $10.75 for 5 boards shipped! That still blows my mind. PCBWay does also offer assembly services, but I chose to assemble this at home and suffer a bit. This took a bit of trial and error with such small parts, but I decided the best way for me was to ditch the stencil and make flux my best friend. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools &amp;amp; parts used:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SRA Solder 135 Rosin Paste Soldering Flux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thin Kester Solder 63/37&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pinecil Soldering Iron&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fine Soldering Iron Tip&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rework Station&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Soldering Hotplate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Digital Microscope or Jewelers Loupe&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fine Tip Tweezer (DON'T cheap out on tweezers! A good tweezer is a game changer)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steps to building one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send the gerber file &lt;code&gt;f32_gerber.zip&lt;/code&gt;found in the&lt;code&gt;hardware&lt;/code&gt;folder to PCBWay with the specs mentioned above.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Order the components noted in &lt;code&gt;f32_bom.pdf&lt;/code&gt;. These parts can be found on both DigiKey and Mouser except the antenna. I don't remember where I had originally ordered them, but I believe they are CrossAir CA-C03.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;** Tip: Always order more than you need, especially with components as small as these.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean the pcb really well with 99% Alcohol.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starting with the top side (Antenna side) apply a thin layer of soldering flux across the entire board using a tooth pick.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using a soldering iron with a fine tip apply some solder to the tip and then go across all the exposed pads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean the board again with 99% alcohol and verify all the pads on this side have some solder on them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apply another thin layer of flux to the same side.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using tweezers and a microscope/loupe start placing the top components following the reference guide &lt;code&gt;f32_reference.pdf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;** Tip: I found placing the larger components last helps.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gently move the board onto the soldering hotplate or use the rework station to heat the solder back up and watch the components wiggle into place.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repeat with Bottom side. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bottom side must be done using a rework hot air gun, not possible with hotplate.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Place the USB-C receptacle last.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean entire board using alcohol and a fine toothbrush.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After assembly you can use ESP-IDF VSCode extension or Arduino and upload whatever you'd like to the board or you can upload my example application using the steps below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure you are in the base directory of this repo and have access to &lt;code&gt;esptool.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure your &lt;code&gt;esptool&lt;/code&gt;version is at&lt;code&gt;v4&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run the following command replacing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PORT&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;with whichever port the device is connected to i.e. on Windows typically something like&lt;code&gt;COM5&lt;/code&gt;or on Linux&lt;code&gt;/dev/ttyACM0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;esptool.py -p &amp;lt;PORT&amp;gt; -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32c3 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 2MB 0x0 firmware/bootloader.bin 0x10000 firmware/f32_internal.bin 0x8000 firmware/partition-table.bin 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well that's up to you to decide. I started this project for some personal research and also a fun learning experience. I had always wanted a project that used 01005 components ever since I had accidentally ordered some years ago. Whatever you choose to use it for, please note that this design intentionally neglects several fundamental components such as proper decoupling capacitors, an antenna matching circuit, USB termination resistors, and likely more. It does function, but it’s intentionally bare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expose more GPIOs on the sides of the PCB to make it a mountable PCB.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improve antenna circuitry.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, fun coincidence, the ESP32 chip, the antenna, and the LDO all are "C3" models!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Textile made of natural stone? Yes, it is possible!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First the basalt is melted at a temperature of 1,400 °C (2550 °F). The molten rock is then extruded through small nozzles for the production of filaments of basalt fibers. The high modulus of elasticity of the product results in an excellent tensile strength, which is more than twice the tensile strength of steel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basalt Woven Textile has high corrosive and chemical resistance to the influence of a corrosive media: salt solutions, acid solutions and particularly alkali liquids. The specific strength of basalt fiber exceeds the strength of alloyed steel by a factor of 2,5 and the strength of glass fiber by a factor of 1,5. Heat-insulating items made from basalt fiber combined with inorganic binding agents may be used by temperatures up to 700°С. In addition there is a range of compositions consisting of basalt rocks that have a higher thermal stability – up to 800°С.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basalt fibers also have high electric-insulating characteristics and transparency for electromagnetic radiation. These properties allow basalt fiber to be used for production of electric insulating materials for low-voltage (up to 250 V) and high-voltage (500 V) equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Laptop Displays&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page provides details on the various laptop display technologies used with DOS laptop, portable and luggable computers. It should be read in conjunction with the Graphics Cards page as well as my CRT Monitors page for completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days we take it for granted that our modern laptops have colour high-resolution screens. Back when manufacturers were trying to make the IBM PC or compatible more transportable and lightweight, installing a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) miniature monitor into a case made it preventatively heavy. CRTs were relatively cheap despite their weight, so it was an obvious choice to use tiny CRTs in their luggable machines. The first portable PCs - the Compaq Portable range - also used a CRT and IBM themselves used one in their first potable, the IBM Portable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After only a handful of these heavyweights, the PC market turned to Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) technology, and whilst it was hugely expensive to make large LCD screens, as popularity of mobile computing grew prices fell, and so the use of LCDs more or less stuck throughout the DOS era in one guise or another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LCD technology was another that first arose in the 1960s. It was tremendously energy-efficient, and required very little space so it suited mobile devices well. Since LCDs don't produce any light themselves (unlike gas plasma), they really needed what was to be called a backlight (literally, a light shining from the back of the screen) to really make the screen more readable. Backlit LCD displays really didn't start to appear until 1988 - before then your laptop computer's LCD display was like a large calculator screen using nothing more than a reflective layer behind the liquid crystals to reflect ambient light! There was also the concept of 'sidelit' displays where rather than shining a light from behind the screen, the display would have a light on each side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even with a backlight, LCD displays have poor contrast and a slow refresh rate, which would produce a "ghosting" effect whenever the displayed content was scrolling or moving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The Toshiba T1100 with its monochrome LCD display (1985)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gas Plasma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gas plasma displays were first used in the 1960s. In a gas plasma display, each pixel is illuminated by a tiny bit of plasma (charged gas). Gas plasma displays are thinner than CRTs due to there being no need for an electron gun at a certain distance from the back of the screen, and are much brighter than LCD displays. The gases used in a gas plasma display are neon and xenon, both inert, and these are sandwiched in between two plates that have been coated in a conductive print - one of which contains vertical lines, and the other, horizontal lines. So together they form a grid. When electric current is passed through the conductive prints on these two plates the gas at the point they meet glows, which is seen by the user as a single pixel lighting up. Despite being particularly bright and produce a nice sharp image, gas plasma displays use a lot of power, making them pretty unsuitable for portable computing, but it made a comeback with flat-panel TVs many years later!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The orange gas plasma display from a Toshiba T3200SX (1989)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Supertwist Nematic (STN) Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invented in 1983, the STN is a type of monochrome passive-matrix LCD display. The "passive" in the wording here means that each pixel must maintain its state (off or on) without active driving circuitry until it can be refreshed again. In a Twisted Nematic (TN) display the liquid crystal molecules have an electric field applied to them to realign the molecules to either be off (twisted 90 degrees, electric field off), or on (untwisted, electric field on). Sadly due to limitations/thresholds of passive-matrix addressing, TN displays could only be so large. In a supertwist nematic display, the molecules are twisted 180 to 270 degrees which allowed for more rows and columns, hence higher resolution displays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All STN displays were monochrome until NEC launched the first colour laptop, the ProSpeed CSX, in October 1989. Several other laptop manufacturers had been working on colour screen technology at the same time, so 1990 saw many more colour laptops arrive on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One advantage of STN displays is that they require no backlight - they are still readable under direct sunlight with a reflective layer behind the display. Unfortunately, because they are still passive matrix, the ghosting effect seen with LCD monochrome displays is still present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The Compaq LTE Elite 4/40C with a colour STN display&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Double Layer Supertwist Nematic (DSTN) Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To overcome the slow refresh rate of STN screens, DSTN technology splits the screen into two halves, where each half is simultaneously refreshed, giving a much faster overall refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, DSTN still suffers from the same inherent problems of any passive-matrix display, like low contrast (typically a DSTN display has a contrast ratio of 15:1 compared to TFT displays which are 40:1 or better), and washed-out colours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The Toshiba Satellite Pro 400CDS with its colour DSTN display&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Thin Film Transistor (TFT) Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TFT, also called "active-matrix" displays arrived around mid-1992, and were available in both monochrome and colour, though most laptop manufacturers had stopped selling monochrome TFT laptops by 1994 as prices of the colour displays dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TFT displays work on the basis of each individual pixel being switched on or off by up to four transistors. The "active" in the name is because each pixel also has a capacitor that actively maintains the pixel state. Whilst much more expensive than STN/DSTN displays, they overcome all the problems of a passive-matrix display. They have a much higher contrast ratio and a fast refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; A Compaq LTE 5200 from 1996 with its colour TFT display&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early TFT displays had a maximum display resolution of 640 x 480 - if you wanted to run Windows in a higher resolution you could do so by attaching an external monitor to the laptop. By 1996 the SVGA resolution of 800 x 600 was becoming more commonplace for TFT laptops, and top-end ones even supported 1,024 x 768.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TFT technology is still widely used on modern-day laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Computation and Language&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 19 Nov 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for large language models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;40 years ago, Calvin and Hobbes' raucous adventures burst onto the comics page&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;40 years ago — on November 18, 1985 — a new comic strip appeared in the newspaper: Calvin and Hobbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hobbes was a stuffed tiger, but in the mind of 6-year-old Calvin he was a wryly observant companion for his day-to-day challenges and wildly imaginative adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adventures of the beloved duo lasted just a decade. Their creator — cartoonist Bill Watterson — walked away from Calvin and Hobbes at the height of its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watterson — who has given few interviews — seamlessly combined the silly, the fantastic and the profound in his strip. That slightly demented quality captured editor Lee Salem, who spoke with NPR's Renee Montagne in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interview highlights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lee Salem: I remember it when I first read it, and it all... it literally took my breath away. And I circulated it in the office, and the response was immediate. It was fresh, it was funny, the art was strong, and here's this archetypal little boy living a life that some of us lived or wanted to live or remembered living. ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the single favorites that I have is actually on my wall in the office, and it shows Calvin in bed, obviously with a fever or something. He's got a thermometer in his mouth. You hear the words from a television. He's watching a soap opera — you know, "If you leave your spouse and I'll leave mine and we can get married." And it goes on and on and on, as lurid soap operas sometimes do. And Calvin turns to the reader with a big grin on his face, and he says, "Sometimes, I learn more when I stay home from school than when I go." And I just thought that was so funny. And, amazingly, when it ran, we actually got complaints from readers who said, "Well, you know, you're advocating that children stay home and watch adult soap operas." And somehow, the whole sense of irony was lost in that, but I don't think it was lost on me. I love that strip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Renee Montagne: You know, I describe him as a little boy with his tiger friend, but there's so much more to it than that. So there's one where they're sitting philosophizing, as they often do, on the grass, this time under a tree. Hobbes is looking at the sky and saying, "Do you think there's a god?" And they're both gazing and thinking, and then in the fourth panel, Calvin thinks about it. And then do you remember what he says?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: Yeah. "Yeah, well, someone is out to get me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montagne: Calvin was preceded into existence by some pretty famous little boys: Charlie Brown, Dennis the Menace. What made him different?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: You know, we saw Calvin living in a world he never made, populated by adults and teachers, and he was trying to deal with that and accomplish what he could. I think Calvin has a bit more perhaps Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in him than Charlie Brown. Hobbes I see almost as the alter ego of Calvin. He's a balancing act that allows Calvin to exist. He provides commentary on some of Calvin's crazy adventures and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montagne: Hobbes goes from being a stuffed tiger when there's any other person in the room, to the real Hobbes we know and love. Is Hobbes real or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: He is to me, and obviously he is to Calvin. Whether he is to the other characters or not is an open question. But I think one of the things Bill brought to the art board was this wonderful ability to take a child's imagination and fantasy life and make it real. It really is irrelevant whether Hobbes has an existence as we would define it. For Calvin, he is there. He's a buddy, he's a companion, he's a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lee Salem edited Calvin and Hobbes until the comic strip ended in 1995. Creator Bill Watterson said at the time that he wanted to explore a canvas beyond the four panels of a daily newspaper, and to work at what he called "a more thoughtful pace," but has produced little public work since then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem died in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;THE HONOURABLE MRS JUSTICE COLLINS RICE&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mrs Justice Collins Rice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a dispute between prominent ‘free software movement’ activists. The free software movement advances a philosophy and practice which values the freedom of users to create and share software enabling internet access, and challenges the dominance of ‘big tech’ software and systems over the online experience. That includes a preference for internet relay chat (‘IRC’), an online instant messaging system dating in origin from the 1990s, over the big social media platforms. The challenge the free software movement makes is not only of a technical, but also of a social, economic or ethical nature, and it espouses some wider sets of values accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Claimant, Dr Matthew Garrett, describes himself as a software engineer, computer security expert, and free software activist, with an academic background in (computational) genetics. He gained his doctorate at Cambridge University, and has worked with ARM Ltd, a Cambridge-based software design company, throughout his career. He is currently based in ‘Silicon Valley’ in California, where he holds a senior position at NVIDIA, one of the top half dozen big tech companies globally, and a part-time lectureship at the University of California, Berkeley, teaching operating systems security for a masters course. He sets out that he has worked on some of the most significant projects in the free software movement and won a Free Software Foundation award in 2013 for his work on Secure Boot, UEFI and the Linux kernel (at the time, he states, the FSF was one of the most important organisations in the world for the advancement of free software).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defendants are a Manchester-based married couple, each of whom operates a UK website focusing on free software information, interests and campaigns, and hosting an IRC channel. Dr Roy Schestowitz describes himself as a software engineer, interdisciplinary researcher and fair competition advocate, with an academic background in medical biophysics. He operates the website www.techrights.org (‘Techrights’). Mrs Rianne Schestowitz describes herself as a computer scientist who works for a FOSS (free and open-source software) specialist. She operates the website news.tuxmachines.org (‘Tuxmachines’). Both websites have been in operation for some two decades. These websites are declared by Dr Schestowitz to be not-for-profit undertakings – they are, he says, a committed labour of love on which they both publish tirelessly to the extent of thousands of articles a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett brings a claim in libel over a series of 24 publications appearing on either Techrights or Tuxmachines or both, in August and September 2023. The publications complained of appear at Annex A to this judgment. Dr Garrett brings a further claim in data protection in respect of these and a number of other publications appearing on the websites at around the same time. Dr and Mrs Schestowitz counterclaim in harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Litigation History&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett issued proceedings, and filed and served his particulars of claim, in April 2024. This had been preceded, as is usual, by a certain amount of correspondence before action, in which Dr Garrett had requested the removal of the publications from the websites. Dr and Mrs Schestowitz declined to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz filed and served a defence and counterclaim in September 2024. The libel claim was resisted on the grounds that (a) none of the publications complained of had caused or was likely to cause serious harm to Dr Garrett’s reputation, and (b) one or more of the statutory defences of truth, honest opinion and publication on a matter of public interest applied. The data protection claim was resisted on the ground that the journalistic purposes exemption applied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz’s pleadings had been professionally prepared, but they have been acting in person in recent months, including representing themselves at trial. There was a significant amount of interlocutory case management activity, overseen by the Masters, in August and September of 2025, notably in relation to timetabling the provision of witness statements by or on behalf of Dr and Mrs Schestowitz. These had still not been forthcoming by the time of the pre-trial review before Griffiths J on 6th October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz did not attend the PTR. Griffiths J proceeded in their absence. His order confirmed, among other things, that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;1.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;By the operation of CPR 32.10, because the Defendants have not served any witness statement or witness summary for use at trial by 29 August 2025, as required by the CCMC Order of Master Davison dated 15 January 2025 and the extension of time granted by the Order of Master Dagnall dated 27 August 2025, neither Defendant is permitted to call any witness to give oral evidence at trial.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;2.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Any application for relief from sanctions will be considered in accordance with CPR 3.8 and CPR 3.9 in the event that such an application is made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There appears to be no record that any formal application was subsequently made, although I was shown an unsealed version of an application by Dr and Mrs Schestowitz to set aside the order of Griffiths J. Dr Schestowitz confirmed to me at the opening of the trial on 30th October 2025, at which he and Mrs Schestowitz were informally supported by a defamation solicitor, that in any event no further order was sought on that (unsealed) application and no further application was being made. He told me that he and Mrs Schestowitz had taken a deliberate decision not to submit any evidence or call any witnesses, on financial grounds. He confirmed that he understood that meant that, while he and Mrs Schestowitz would be able to put Dr Garrett to proof of his claims, to cross-examine the claimant witnesses (Dr Garrett and his solicitor), and to make submissions to me, they would not be able by these means to introduce evidence in support of their defence and counterclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defamation ‘Preliminary Issues’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There had been no ‘preliminary issues’ determination ahead of trial in this case. Mr Hamer, Counsel for Dr Garrett, explained that the parties’ pleadings had not been very far apart in this respect. Nevertheless, there was no formal agreement about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Single natural and ordinary meaning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My preliminary task was therefore to “determine the single natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of, which is the meaning that the hypothetical reasonable reader would understand the words to bear”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legal principles I am required to apply in doing so are well established. I directed myself to the useful guidance on determination of ‘single natural and ordinary meaning’ distilled from the authorities (including that of the Supreme Court in Stocker v Stocker [2020] AC 593) and set out in Koutsogiannis v Random House Group[2020] 4 WLR 25,at [11] and [12]. The guidance of the authorities is of course just that – guidance – intended to simplify not complicate the exercise. And each case turns on its own facts. But the following briefly summarises the guidance as it applies to the present case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The governing principle in determining ‘meaning’ is reasonableness. The intention of the publisher (here, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz respectively) is irrelevant in law: the test focuses on how words are read, not how or why they came to be written. It is an objective, not subjective, test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each publication must be considered as a whole, in the context in which an ordinary reasonable reader would have read it. That reference to ‘context’ was explained by Nicklin J in Riley v Murray [2020] EMLR 20 at [15]-[17]. I can, and where relevant should, take account of: (a) matters of common knowledge – facts so well known that, for practical purposes, everybody knows them; (b) matters to be treated as intrinsic to the publication – for example via a hyperlink; and (c) any other material that could reasonably be expected to have been known or read by all the readers of the publication complained of. But otherwise, no evidence beyond the publication complained of is admissible as to what it means. And natural and ordinary meaning does not rely on a reader having any special knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am guided away from over-elaborate or lawyerly analysis of text. I need to avoid both literalism, and any strained or forced interpretation. I can and must determine the single meaning I myself consider correct, and am not bound by the meanings advanced by the parties (so long as I do not alight on something more injurious than a claimant's pleaded meaning).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I am to keep in mind, as guided, the perspective of an ordinary, reasonable reader of each article complained of, reading it once through as it appears, and forming an impression of what it conveys on its face. The reasonable reader is neither naïve nor suspicious; is able to read between the lines and pick up an implication; and is allowed a certain amount of loose thinking without being ‘avid for scandal’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fact/opinion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have further directed myself to Koutsogiannis at [16] and [17], as well as to Millett v Corbyn [2021] EWCA Civ 567, for guidance on considering whether the words complained of contain allegations of fact or expressions of opinion. I am reminded by the authorities that the test for the difference between fact and opinion is an objective one. That comes back to how the words would strike the ordinary reasonable reader. I have to look at the substance, not the intention of the writer or any label the writer may, or may not, have attached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subject matter and immediate context can be especially important here. In the classic formulation, “opinion is something which is or can reasonably be inferred to be a deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, judgment, remark or observation” (Clarke v Norton [1910] VLR 494 at page 499). But sometimes care is needed: there is a difference between comment which is pure opinion and comment which is an imputation of underlying fact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Factual allegations can be published with varying degrees of certainty as to what is being imputed. These degrees of certainty have been classically analysed at three distinct levels : level 1: the claimant is 'guilty' of the conduct alleged; level 2: there is 'reason to suspect' the claimant is guilty of the conduct alleged; and level 3: there are 'grounds for investigating whether' the claimant is guilty of the conduct alleged (Chase v. News Group Newspapers[2002] EWCA Civ 172).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While ‘meaning’ and ‘fact/opinion’ are distinct preliminary issues, the authorities counsel against trying to resolve them in too linear or compartmentalised a fashion. I have to bear in mind whether this is a case in which the questions of ‘meaning’ and ‘fact/opinion’ might throw light on each other, such that it would be wrong to tackle them in a sequence which proves to be a trap of false logic. I note the risk and seek to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defamatory Tendency&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test at common law for whether a (natural and ordinary) meaning is defamatory is well-established: whether it substantially affects in an adverse manner the attitude of other people towards a claimant, or has a tendency to do so. Some recent authorities put it in terms of identifying that a claimant has breached the common, shared values of our society (Millett v Corbyn). This is not about actual impact at this stage, it is about the meaning of the words themselves and their inherent tendency to damage someone’s reputation. ‘Substantially’ imports a threshold of gravity or seriousness (Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Ltd [2010] EWHC 1414).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approach, Consideration and Determinations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I adopted the standard approach to the determination of meaning and the other preliminary issues. I read each article complained of quickly once through, before knowing what either party wanted to say about it. I formed and noted my initial impressions. I then read the parties’ pleadings and skeleton arguments or position statements, heard oral submissions (neither Dr nor Mrs Schestowitz chose to address me orally on the preliminary issues), and reserved judgment as to how far to adjust my initial views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table attached to this judgment at Annex B sets out the parties’ rival meanings and, in the final column, the matters I have now determined. Where relevant, I have included some short explanatory notes for my decisions where there appeared to be any significant dispute about a particular issue. The following general points also arise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I have had to reflect in a number of respects on whether my preliminary views on meaning needed to be moderated on the ground that they went further than those contended for by the Claimant. Where I have concluded that my meaning was simply a particularisation of matters expressed in more general terms by the Claimant, I have not done so. Where, however, I had identified a meaning not referred to in the Claimant’s pleading, I have withdrawn it for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, while each publication’s meaning is determined on its own terms, some common repetitive themes emerge. Dr Garrett is chiefly accused of an online campaign of material which is (variously) criminal, illegal or offensive. The criminal matters alleged include cybercrime, hate crime, blackmail, issuing threats of violence or death, and matters adjacent to terrorism. Other illegal matters alleged include defamation, harassment and online abuse. Offensive matters alleged include material that is variously racist, antisemitic, misogynist, homophobic or otherwise hateful or discriminatory, sexually incontinent, or drugs-related. Dr Garrett is alleged to have waged this campaign through the medium of IRC ‘sockpuppet’ accounts – accounts under pseudonymous user nicknames intended to be a vehicle for distributing material anonymously and deniably. Many posts from these accounts are reproduced in the articles complained of. Dr Garrett is also repeatedly alleged to be an uncontrolled user of illegal class A drugs, principally crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, I have concurred with the parties in understanding that most of the allegations relate to online behaviour. But there are some notable exceptions to that, chief of which is the allegation relating to Dr Garrett’s being an habitual cocaine user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, where criminal or illegal acts are alleged, the meanings I have determined are closer to those contended for by the Claimant – namely that these are allegations of fact at Chase level 1. An ordinary reasonable reader would, in my view, have no difficulty in understanding that Dr Garrett is straightforwardly being said to have committed them. Where, however, offensive attitudinal matters are alleged – racism, misogyny, etc – the meanings I have determined are closer to those contended for by the Defendants – namely that these are evaluative expressions of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although it is not formally admitted, there can be no doubt at all that each of the publications is of grossly ‘defamatory tendency’ at common law. They allege multiple and serious transgressions of society’s norms, up to and including the criminal law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Serious Harm’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By section 1(1) of the Defamation Act 2013, ‘A statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leading authority on this provision is the decision of the Supreme Court in Lachaux v Independent Print Ltd [2020] AC 612. As Lord Sumption’s judgment makes clear ([12]-[14]), section 1(1) imposed a new threshold test for defamation claims, the application of which is to be determined by reference to the actual facts about the impact of a publication, and not just to the meaning of the words. It requires real-world effects to be established beyond the inherent ‘defamatory tendency’ of any publication. The statutory term ‘has caused’ points to some historic reputational harm, which can be shown actually to have occurred; and ‘is likely to cause’ points to probable, actual, future reputational harm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The serious harm test is a question of fact, and facts must be established by evidence. Facts and evidence – and causation – are matters which are entirely case-specific. But a claimant’s statutory task of establishing that publishees changed their minds for the worse about them – and to a degree warranting the description of ‘serious reputational harm’ – because of reading something, poses clear evidential challenges. That is partly because of the nature of the harm in question: the ‘harm’ of defamation is the effect of a publication in the mind of a third-party publishee (reader), and not any action they may take as a result (nor is it the direct effect of a publication on a claimant reading it themselves). And it is partly because of simple practical considerations: particularly in cases of mass publication, the minds of the publishees may be effectively evidentially unreachable. In such cases, finding enough readers willing to testify that they thought the worse of a claimant has long been recognised as a prohibitively impractical undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authorities have therefore developed some detailed guidelines for trial courts applying the serious harm test in ‘mass publication’ cases. In such cases, Lachaux confirmed (at [21]) that a claimant may be able to discharge their evidential burden of establishing serious reputational harm by inference drawn from a factual matrix combining the meaning of the words, the situation of the claimant, the circumstances of the publication(s) complained of and the inherent circumstantial probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That matrix, in turn, has to be established as a matter of fact and evidence. But again, the authorities give some assistance. The well-established ‘grapevine’ or ‘percolation’ tendencies (Slipper v BBC[1991] 1 QB 283; Cairns v Modi[2013] 1 WLR 1015) of defamatory publications, particularly online and through social media of any kind, may in an appropriate case be factored into inference about scale of publication. And the likely identity, as well as the numbers, of at least some of a class of publishees may be relevant to the assessment of harm, for example where some individuals may be particularly positioned to lose confidence in a claimant or take adverse action as a result. But these are highly fact-specific matters; the inferences which may properly be drawn in any individual case depend entirely on the circumstances of that case. The Court of Appeal in Blake v Fox[2025] EWCA Civ 1321 has, however, recently indicated that if a claimant establishes a factual matrix of mass publication, grave defamatory tendency of the content, and the claimant’s significant reputational exposure, then the inference of serious reputational harm may have to be considered by a court to be irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consideration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approach, and Gravity of Imputation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett advances a wholly inferential case of serious harm, relying on this being a case of mass publication, very grave inherent defamatory content, the engagement of his own professional and reputational capital, and inherent probabilities. The burden lies on him to establish this underpinning factual matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a starting point, I have no difficulty in the first place in recognising the heavy gravity of the allegations made in each and every publication complained of. Dr Garrett’s responsibility for a relentless online campaign of harassment and abuse, by the covert means of sockpuppet accounts, is advanced as fact. Extensive, multiple and serious online criminality is advanced as fact. Dr Garrett is accused of publishing a range of toxic or highly offensive online material by reference to direct quotations from the sockpuppet accounts he is accused of authoring; this material is on its face grossly offensive in many dimensions and carries clear implications of the social and moral turpitude of its author. Habitual illegal class A drug use is advanced as fact. In the meanings I have determined – and as to which the parties’ pleaded cases were not in the end separated by a wide margin, since they largely spoke for themselves – the publications complained of are undoubtedly very grave indeed. I did not hear that seriously disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz however make a double challenge to Dr Garrett’s task of establishing a factual matrix to support an inference of serious harm. They put him to proof (a) that this is in fact a mass publication case, and (b) that his reputation is materially engaged – in each case, within the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Situation of the Claimant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking the latter first, the ‘situation of the claimant’ in this case is that Dr Garrett was born in Ireland and moved to England with his family as a very young child. He emigrated to California in 2009 and has not lived in the UK for 16 years. He holds UK, Irish and US citizenship. To succeed on his claim as brought, he has to demonstrate serious reputational harm within the court’s jurisdiction – that is, in England and Wales. His evidence about his reputation here is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett states that his reputation in England is both established, and ‘immensely important’ to him. Before 2009 he had worked for the University of Cambridge and had done other Cambridge-based work, starting by doing contract work and working for a tech start-up, before going on to work for Collabora (described as a private open-source software consulting company headquartered in Cambridge) and for Red Hat, a US company with a wholly-owned British subsidiary which had been his employer here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He draws attention to his current senior role with NVIDIA, which ‘does significant business in Britain’. In that role he has undertaken collaborative work with British companies including Collabora, Linaro, ARM and other consulting firms, including while present in the jurisdiction. He describes these ‘ongoing collaborations’ as being ‘extremely important in terms of providing value to my employer since then’. His evidence is that ‘the reason I am valuable to my employer and my previous employers, is that I am exceedingly good at working across a range of different technologies and with a range of different companies. If my ability to work with any of the companies who are working in a specific field is impaired, the value proposition of me for my employer goes down’. He states that damage to his reputation in England ‘would have an impact on NVIDIA’s willingness to continue employing me’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett draws attention to the fact that he holds a teaching position at a US university with an international reputation in his field, including in this country, and was awarded a ‘distinguished faculty award’ by that university. His evidence is that his past and present academic reputation is engaged in England. Of his future plans, he states that ‘my goal in the end, at the point where I am in a position to retire, is to be able to move back to the United Kingdom and potentially adopt a position at a university here’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he is regularly invited to speak at major events (with thousands of attendees) concerned with free software, Linux or cybersecurity generally, and has done so in the UK on half a dozen occasions in recent years. He has also spoken at major European events with significant attendance from UK participants, including in the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett also gives evidence that he has many friends and colleagues in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did not hear this evidence materially challenged in substance. Dr Garrett’s evidence on the nature, extent and value of his reputation in England and Wales was clear and straightforward. I can and do accept it. It enables me to find as a fact that his professional, employment, academic and personal reputation is materially engaged within the jurisdiction. I make that finding accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extent of Publication&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The principal dispute in this case on the question of serious reputational harm is, however, that of extent of publication (within the jurisdiction) of the articles complained of. Mr Hamer contended for an inference of a readership in the tens of thousands, within the jurisdiction, for each article complained of, to date. The evidence of this before me was limited. I do not of course have any evidence from Dr and Mrs Schestowitz, and the pre-trial disclosure exercise revealed no analytics for readership of the articles in question (the defence states that ‘site analysis data is wiped after short periods of retention’).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not in dispute that the websites get something like a million hits a day. A hit is not an indication of readership; a single page may require a number of ‘hits’ to be viewed. Dr Schestowitz made a challenge that something like half of those could be immediately discounted as machine-generated (bots, crawlers and so on). He made a challenge to the remaining figure based on the proportion of the anglophone world attributable to the UK being a percentage in the low single figures. He made a further challenge based on the high rate with which new articles are posted on both websites, and the relative age (and therefore incremental occlusion) of the material complained of. He challenged that there was no evidential basis in the ‘million a day’ figure for a readership above tens in the UK on any one day, and that many of them would likely be repeat viewers, reading the same articles again and again. Dr Schestowitz pointed out that neither he nor Mrs Schestowitz publishes on, or is a user of, mass social media platforms, that their websites attract viewers with similar preferences against modern social media, and that the grapevine or percolation effects often deployed in defamation litigation to encourage inference of mass publication are accordingly of limited application here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these circumstances, and having been put to proof of extent of publication, Dr Garrett’s case that this is an instance of mass publication was advanced evidentially by him, and in argument by Mr Hamer, along the following lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, all of the articles complained of remain online, and have done so since their original publication more than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, a number of the articles appear reduplicated on both websites, and a number cross refer to each other via embedded hyperlinks. The final publication (the Wiki page) is a compendious hyperlink library of nearly all the articles complained of. The articles, in other words, contain within themselves mechanisms of accessibility and republication, and hence maximise readership potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, and bearing in mind the extent of his reputational engagement in the UK, recent Google searches on Dr Garrett’s name from a UK location were bringing up links to Techrights and Tuxmachines articles complained of (including the final Wiki page publication) on the first page, and, it appears, also did so around the time of the original publication (as one of the Tuxmachines posts seems to have acknowledged). That suggests both (a) the continuing ready accessibility of the material complained of to those interested in Dr Garrett and (b) the historical popularity of actual access to the Schestowitz websites via Google. Google is of course only one among a number of popular search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, both websites are well-established. It is conspicuous that each has been active over two decades; that is a significant marker in the field. Dr Garrett’s evidence is that they are serious, sought-after, well-regarded, popular and trusted in the anglophone free software community, including for news, campaigning and educational content. Neither Dr nor Mrs Schestowitz suggested otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final piece in the jigsaw Mr Hamer sought to assemble is a centuries-old English legal principle, derived from the case of Armory v Delamirie(1721) 93 ER 664, that, to the extent that there are gaps in trial evidence, a party who is responsible for them is not entitled to benefit from them. The principle in Armory has been recognised in the caselaw as having a potential to apply in defamation actions to assist a claimant in discharging their burden of proof, where a defendant has failed to provide disclosure or evidence of extent of publication (see, for example, Dudley v Phillips [2022] EWHC 930 (QB) at [25]). Here, Mr Hamer submitted, not only were the relevant analytical data not preserved or disclosed, but a deliberate decision was made by the Defendants to provide no evidence of the extent of the publications for which they were responsible, and therefore not to submit themselves to cross-examination about it. In those circumstances, Mr Harmer submitted, readership of at least tens of thousands could fairly be inferred in relation to any and all of the publications complained of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have reflected carefully on Dr Schestowitz’s challenge, Mr Hamer’s submissions and Dr Garrett’s evidence. I bear in mind the years-long persistence, cross-referencing and indexing apparent within the articles. I can and do place weight on the evidence I have to suggest that the publications complained of were accessible to, and accessed by, a UK public searching online for information about Dr Garrett. It is common ground that Techrights and Tuxmachines are popular and authoritative sites, including in the UK, among those interested or active in the free software community. I do not understand it to be in dispute that that wider community in the UK is otherwise than substantial, perhaps in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Dr Garrett is, I have accepted, someone with a profile in that community, and the allegations in the articles complained of are of a sensational and eye-catching nature (and tone). In these circumstances, it appears to me that a total readership of the articles to date, including by way of some onward republication (percolation), of the order of at least thousands is more probably than not a fair estimate. And if there are doubts about that, Dr Garrett is entitled to rely on the Armory principle to have them resolved in his favour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inherent Probabilities and Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A readership of at least thousands makes a fair case, in context, for regarding this as an example of ‘mass publication’. It is not of the order of a national newspaper or news channel. But nor is it a case dealing with publication to a limited class of identified or identifiable individuals. Just as important as the raw numbers is the identity of the likely readership. I am satisfied that publication in this case was to precisely the constituency – individuals in the UK interested in the free software community and in the doings of free software activists, and who had either already heard of or were likely to take an interest in Dr Garrett – with which Dr Garrett’s UK reputation was most closely engaged. I have to consider that in conjunction with the gravity of the allegations. Sockpuppetry, trolling, inappropriate sexual content and hate speech are allegations of profound breaches of the ‘netiquette’ of this community in their own right. The accusations about the content of this behaviour – serious online crime – push those allegations to the extremes of gravity in context. Coupled with the imputations going to Dr Garrett’s offline private life, including sexual misconduct (or crime) and the habitual use of illegal class A drugs, it is hard to imagine a more serious assault on the professional and personal reputation of a prominent free software activist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all these circumstances, I accept Dr Garrett’s case that not only is the inherent meaning of the publications complained of grave, but they have caused and are likely to cause him serious reputational harm. Indeed, on the basis of the factual matrix advanced and established, and mindful of the guidance in Blake v Fox, the inference of serious harm may have to be regarded as inescapable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Statutory Defences to Defamation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The statutory defences provided by the Defamation Act 2013 are set out as follows, as relevant:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Defences&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;2.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Truth&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the imputation conveyed by the statement complained of is substantially true.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Subsection (3) applies in an action for defamation if the statement complained of conveys two or more distinct imputations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If one or more of the imputations is not shown to be substantially true, the defence under this section does not fail if, having regard to the imputations which are shown to be substantially true, the imputations which are not shown to be substantially true do not seriously harm the claimant's reputation..&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;3.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Honest opinion&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the following conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The first condition is that the statement complained of was a statement of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The second condition is that the statement complained of indicated, whether in general or specific terms, the basis of the opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(4)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The third condition is that an honest person could have held the opinion on the basis of—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;any fact which existed at the time the statement complained of was published;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;anything asserted to be a fact in a privileged statement published before the statement complained of.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(5)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The defence is defeated if the claimant shows that the defendant did not hold the opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(7)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of subsection (4)(b) a statement is a “privileged statement” if the person responsible for its publication would have one or more of the following defences if an action for defamation were brought in respect of it—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;a defence under section 4 (publication on matter of public interest);&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;4.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Publication on matter of public interest&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;the statement complained of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matter of public interest; and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;the defendant reasonably believed that publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Subject to subsections (3) and (4), in determining whether the defendant has shown the matters mentioned in subsection (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the statement complained of was, or formed part of, an accurate and impartial account of a dispute to which the claimant was a party, the court must in determining whether it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that publishing the statement was in the public interest disregard any omission of the defendant to take steps to verify the truth of the imputation conveyed by it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(4)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In determining whether it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest, the court must make such allowance for editorial judgement as it considers appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(5)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, the defence under this section may be relied upon irrespective of whether the statement complained of is a statement of fact or a statement of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All three defences are pleaded in the present case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Truth Defence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pleading and evidence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pleading of the truth defence – that is, the pleading that what is said about Dr Garrett in the publications complained of, in the natural and ordinary meanings I have determined, is in objective fact true – relies on (a) a small number of messages Dr Garrett accepts he posted and (b) his asserted authorship of a campaign of threats, abuse and harassment conducted from a list of named sockpuppet accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authorship or control of these accounts has consistently been strenuously denied by Dr Garrett. I have no evidence from the Defendants to support it. Instead, they necessarily rely on an inferential case built on a limited number of pleaded facts, some of which are undisputed. I consider them in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the defence relies on an incident a few years prior to the sockpuppet campaign, in which Dr Garrett admittedly registered himself online in two borrowed names for the purpose of making a rhetorical or satirical point about the owner of those names. Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he did so openly, and with the knowledge of the owner (who had himself vacated the names in order to borrow another user’s nickname – which was in part Dr Garrett’s point in also doing so). Dr Schestowitz clearly takes exception to that particular piece of theatricality as a major breach of netiquette in its own right, and regards it as a sign or symptom of propensity for sockpuppetry. But the incident in question, on its face, is plainly something quite different from the covert use of sockpuppet accounts to publish illegal or offensive material, and is not in my judgment capable of indicating any sort of propensity to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, it is said there was an incident in which Dr Garrett’s own named account and one of the sockpuppet accounts experienced simultaneous dropped connections. If established, that could indicate dual operation by a single individual. The evidence from the Claimant is that the dropped connections were not in fact simultaneous. I have no evidential basis for doing otherwise than proceeding on that basis. This pleading cannot in the circumstances support an inference of Dr Garrett’s authorship of the sockpuppet posts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, there are some facts pleaded which are capable of linking the sockpuppets to each other. They are not capable of being linked to Dr Garrett by that means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, it is pleaded that after Dr Schestowitz had made a complaint naming Dr Garrett as the suspected author of the complaints, they subsided. I have no evidence of this – of its extent, timing, or at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, it is suggested there is some similarity in the language used by Dr Garrett in his own account and that in one of the sockpuppet accounts. That suggested similarity is not particularised. I was not taken to it by Dr or Mrs Schestowitz. It is not immediately obvious on the face of the publications complained of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sixth, one of the sockpuppet accounts on one occasion posted a short insult in the Irish language. Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he does not speak Irish and would have been incapable of posting that insult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seventh, it is suggested that one of the sockpuppet accounts used the first person singular in referring to an accusation made against Dr Garrett. I was not taken to this example, or its context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz took me to a small number of posts Dr Garrett had made on a website he had operated some 25 years ago, when he would have been aged about 20. In one, he made a comment about people feeling the need to punch someone. In another he referred to being sorely tempted to write a book entitled Axe-murdering for fun and profit as a disincentive to people bothering him. In a third he expressed exasperation with some individuals along lines that it made him want to stab them and then stab himself. In a later social media post in 2018 on Twitter (X), he was involved in a game of listing criteria for electing a new prime minister, in which he proposed ‘1. Cancel Brexit; 2. Decriminalise most drugs; 3. Spend less on candles [an internet meme]; 4. Resign’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no difficulty in immediately recognising all of these as examples of jocular or facetious rhetoric. Dr Garrett’s own evidence was that he now considered them callow and in poor taste; they were mostly decades old, and he would not express himself in this kind of way any longer. Dr Schestowitz plainly regarded them as unpleasant breaches of netiquette. But the proposition that these examples should be taken literally, and this sort of online discourse considered indicative of a propensity in real life to the use of sockpuppetry to threaten or commit violence, or to an illegal drugs habit, cannot begin to get off the ground. They are clearly nowhere near any such thing. Nor are such allusions to bladed weaponry as they contain any sort of basis for inferring that sockpuppet accounts under names such as ‘Dr Axe’ were being operated by Dr Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is Dr Garrett’s evidence that at least some of the sockpuppet posts were posted at a time when he can establish he was teaching a university class. It is also his evidence that it was not practically possible for him to have been the author of those posts, both because he did not have access to the IRC channel on his phone and because he could not have done so without attracting the attention of his students.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assessment and conclusions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is plain that the onslaught of sockpuppet trolling to which Mrs Schestowitz in particular was subjected was a truly appalling experience – the very antithesis of everything Tuxmachines and Techrights stands for in the free software community. There is not the slightest suggestion that either Dr or Mrs Schestowitz did anything to invite or deserve it. They are both clearly and justifiably angered, dismayed, distressed and hurt by it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also plain that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz do not think highly of Dr Garrett in general. Some of that appears to have had its origins in differences of professional views. Some of it may be to do with his choices to move to Silicon Valley and to work for, with or alongside big tech companies; Dr Schestowitz explained clearly to me how and why they themselves have made different choices. Some of it may be to do with Dr Garrett’s modes of online expression and what they consider to be his poor netiquette; Dr and Mrs Schestowitz explained to me that these are matters they take very seriously, and that they are serious people running serious websites dealing in serious technical and socio-political matters. They do not admire facetiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also plain enough that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz have found it entirely straightforward to convince themselves that Dr Garrett was behind the trolling. But the task they have given themselves in pleading the truth defence in defamation proceedings is to establish or prove, on the balance of probabilities, that that is objectively true. And they have made that exceptionally difficult for themselves by advancing no evidence for it. I can only uphold a truth defence if I am given a sufficient evidential basis for doing so. I have looked hard at the defence as pleaded. I can recognise the matters I have been shown, in all the contextual circumstances, as the reasons Dr and Mrs Schestowitz advance to explain their suspicions of Dr Garrett. But I cannot possibly recognise in them, singly or together, anything capable of establishing the objective truth that Dr Garrett was their troll. They are simply not capable of sustaining the weight of a truth defence, or enabling me properly to find that, more probably than not, what the publications said about Dr Garrett was the verifiable truth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make such a finding, I would have both to reject Dr Garrett’s own clear evidence, and to discount the possibility that, if Dr and Mrs Schestowitz suspected Dr Garrett of the posts, some third party operator(s) responsible for the sockpuppets might at some level have encouraged that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found Dr Garrett in general a straightforward witness who gave a clear account of himself under sustained challenge in the witness box. I have been given no proper basis for rejecting his plain, unqualified and vehement denial that he ever had anything to do with the sockpuppet campaign against Dr and Mrs Schestowitz. The matters pleaded by way of the truth defence barely raise a statable case that he did. I accept Dr Garrett’s evidence. He is entitled in these circumstances to a clear finding that I have not been shown any evidence on which I can fairly place any weight, that he was responsible for the sockpuppets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being so, there is no such evidence before me that Dr Garrett habitually uses illegal class A drugs. There is no such evidence he has committed any crimes. There is no such evidence he has threatened, abused or harassed anyone, or that he has espoused or promulgated repugnant and hateful views. There is no basis on which I can properly find any of the many factual accusations levelled against him in the publications complained of to be true. The truth defence must fail in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Honest Opinion Defence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The honest opinion defence is pleaded bare, otherwise than by reference to the allegation that Dr Garrett was responsible for the sockpuppet trolling. In the meanings I have determined, the allegations identified as matters of opinion are all identified as descriptors of the content of the campaign he is alleged to have pursued. That is the only ‘basis of opinion’ articulated in the articles complained of for the purposes of section 3(3) of the Defamation Act 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, as I have concluded, I am unable to uphold the contended factual truth of Dr Garrett’s responsibility for the sockpuppet trolling, that is not a basis on which the honest opinion defence can be upheld either. An honest person has no basis in contemporaneous fact, as required by section 3(4)(a), for an opinion that Dr Garrett was responsible for an offensive and hateful campaign, when he cannot be shown to have been responsible for the campaign at all. The honest opinion defence is unsustainable accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Public Interest Defence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have reminded myself of the review of the authorities on this defence set out by Nicklin J in Turley v Unite The Union [2019] EWHC 3547 (QB) at [137]-[138]. A three stage approach has to be taken. Stage one asks whether the statement complained of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matter of public interest. The second establishes whether the defendant believed publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest. The third asks whether any such belief was reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pleading of the defence in the present case addresses the first question by asserting that all the statements complained of were publications on a matter of public interest, namely ‘the exposure of a vicious and persistent troll committing, among other wrongs, communication and harassment offences in an attempt by the Claimant to intimidate and obstruct promotion of computing standards argued for by the Defendants and that have wide significance within the field of computing’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authorities guide that public interest is a broad concept in this context, and can be considered in the light of whether publications make a contribution to a matter of public debate, but is distinguishable from matters that are personal or private. I can see that the promotion of high standards of online behaviour, and the calling out of unlawful, intimidatory or suppressive behaviour, are capable of being included in the broad ambit of a ‘matter of public interest’. The question here would really be about whether any of the publications complained of is recognisable as contributing to it. Dr and Mrs Schestowitz took a decision not to write general articles about the trolling they had received (nor, indeed, it would appear, to block the sockpuppet accounts), but instead (a) to republish quantities of it and (b) to attribute it to Dr Garrett in strongly and personally deprecatory terms. There can be little doubt on a fair reading of the articles that their focus is squarely on attacking Dr Garrett rather than any more objective or issues-based purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any event, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz face a major hurdle at the second stage of the test, because I have no evidence as to their beliefs at the time of publication. Here is what Nicklin J said at [138(vii)] in Turley v Unite:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A defendant wishing to rely upon the defence must have believed what s/he published was in the public interest: Economou [139(2)] and [153] per Warby J (at first instance: [2017] EMLR 4). The defendant must have addressed his/her mind to the issue. This element of the defence is not established by showing that a notional reasonable person could have believed that the publication was in the public interest, but that the relevant defendant did believe that it was. In terms of evidence, if a defendant leaves this issue unaddressed in his/her witness evidence, the defence is likely to fail at this initial hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the present case, of course, there is no witness evidence from either defendant at all. They are required to establish their state of mind by setting it out in evidence. They have not done so. I cannot just assume it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the third stage, had they been able to reach that far, the problems for sustaining this defence would only multiply. The reasonableness of any subjective public interest belief has to be tested objectively, including by probing what a publisher had done and not done to ‘guard as far as possible against the publication of untrue defamatory material’ and what checks and enquiries they had made. Here is Nicklin J again, at [138] of Turley v Unite:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(xv)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a basic requirement of fairness and responsible journalism that someone who is going to publish a defamatory allegation against a person without being required to show that it is true should give him/her a fair opportunity to put his/her side of the story; … This is not only to be fair to the subject, it recognises that the subject may well have relevant factual information to provide that may affect the decision to publish or the terms in which the publication is presented… . The importance of making an attempt to present the subject of the publication’s side of the story may require the publisher to consider whether others who could reasonably be expected to have relevant information about the allegations should be approached… .&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(xvi)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although … it will not always be necessary to approach the subject of a defamatory article for comment prior to publication, the circumstances in which a publisher will be able to satisfy the Court that it was reasonable not to have done so will necessarily be rare… .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no evidence as to any due diligence undertaken before the articles complained of were published. The defence is pleaded by reference to the reasonableness of reliance on the assemblage of matters I have considered in relation to the truth defence above, which, for the reasons I have given, are not reasonably recognisable as an exercise in considered research and verification. Dr Garrett was not approached to give his side of the story. One of the articles complained of (publication 14 and 15) reproduced a paragraph from a letter Dr Garrett had written on 5th August 2023, stating that ‘As I have previously informed you via email, I am not responsible for the elusive_woman IRC account or any of the other accounts you have incorrectly asserted I am linked to. I have provided evidence that I am not that person’ – namely that one of the postings from the account mentioned was made at a time he was teaching a class. The letter had gone on to challenge Dr Schestowitz for appearing to accept that others might have been involved in the trolling, but that part of the letter was not reproduced. Beneath the (cropped) picture of the letter was commentary beginning ‘Oh, wow! How will I know if you are lying again?’ and continuing with invective and multiple accusations against him. This has little claim to being in the nature of affording a fair right of reply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Schestowitz made an eloquent case to me for the websites he and his wife operate being quintessentially public interest, not-for-profit endeavours, conscientiously dedicated to the interests of the free software community, trusted and well-regarded as such. I can accept that. I can also easily understand that he and Mrs Schestowitz had felt attacked and threatened by the sockpuppet trolling, on both a personal basis and on behalf of all they were trying to do and achieve with their websites. That is not, however, enough to engage the public interest defence to publication of libels that cannot be shown to be true, blaming and defaming someone for the trolling on no better basis than that produced in these proceedings. Any belief in the public interest in naming and shaming Dr Garrett – repeatedly, and in the most personal and derogatory terms – on such a basis could not in my judgment be regarded as a reasonable one for the purposes of the defence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all these circumstances, the public interest defence inevitably fails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summary and conclusions on liability in defamation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz are proud of Techrights and Tuxmachines – their lives’ dedicated labour, passion and achievement. They are proud of the websites’ decades-long record of hosting an important and well-regarded IRC for the free software community in the UK and beyond, and of the thousands of informed and informative articles the websites have carried, including the results of some significant investigative journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They were understandably horrified to become the victims of an anonymous internet campaign of abuse, threats and harassment a couple of years ago. Nothing could have been further from the websites’ ethos, and it must have been traumatising for them on a personal level. Their response was publicly and repeatedly to blame Dr Garrett for it all, having convinced themselves they had some reasons for suspecting him of being behind the anonymous trolling – and to do so in a manner that was bitter, highly personal and thoroughly derogatory. They were undeterred by his protests that he had nothing to do with it. They steadfastly refused to take their accusatory material down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett has been successful in advancing a defamation claim to the point at which Dr and Mrs Schestowitz are required by law either to concede the claim or defend it. They chose to defend it, but they chose to do so without advancing any evidence in support of their defences. A court’s job is to apply the law to the facts as it finds them, and to find the relevant facts according to the evidence before it. If it is provided with no evidence in support of a libel defence, there is a limit to what a court can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have considered the defences pleaded by Dr and Mrs Schestowitz as best I can, given that they provided me with no evidence to work with. The bases they advanced for their suspicions that Dr Garrett was behind the sockpuppet trolling were simply not capable in the circumstances of adding up to an evidential proof on which a court could properly find that was, objectively, true. That allegation was at the heart of their resistance to Dr Garrett’s claim, and they have not enabled me properly to do anything other than reject it as capable of founding a defence, either by establishing that they had done due diligence at the time, or by advancing evidence or proof of objective truth I could consider at trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A defamation claimant in these circumstances is entitled to a judgment, and to remedies, which repudiate the publications complained of, vindicate his reputation, and restore his good name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Data Protection Claim&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr Hamer indicated to me at trial that, in the event that I upheld Dr Garrett’s claim in defamation, I could consider myself invited to conclude that it was unnecessary for me to consider the data protection claim on its merits. In the circumstances, I accept that invitation. Although the data protection claim extends to a number of publications additional to those on which the libel claim was based, and although it extends to the processing of Dr Garrett’s personal data in forms other than publication, I am satisfied that embarking on a full analysis of the data protection claim would be disproportionate to any additional vindicatory justice, or remedies, it could potentially achieve for Dr Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Harassment Counterclaim&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides as follows, as material:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;1.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Prohibition of harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A person must not pursue a course of conduct—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which amounts to harassment of another, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(1A) A person must not pursue a course of conduct —&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which involves harassment of two or more persons, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which he knows or ought to know involves harassment of those persons, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(c)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;by which he intends to persuade any person (whether or not one of those mentioned above)—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(i)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;not to do something that he is entitled or required to do, or&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(ii)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;to do something that he is not under any obligation to do.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this section …, the person whose course of conduct is in question ought to know that it amounts to or involves harassment of another if a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think the course of conduct amounted to harassment of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;3.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Civil remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An actual or apprehended breach of section 1(1) may be the subject of a claim in civil proceedings by the person who is or may be the victim of the course of conduct in question.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On such a claim, damages may be awarded for (among other things) any anxiety caused by the harassment and any financial loss resulting from the harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;3A. Injunctions to protect persons from harassment within section 1(1A)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This section applies where there is an actual or apprehended breach of section 1(1A) by any person (“ the relevant person ”).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In such a case—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;any person who is or may be a victim of the course of conduct in question, or&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;any person who is or may be a person falling within section 1(1A)(c),&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;may apply to the High Court or the county court for an injunction restraining the relevant person from pursuing any conduct which amounts to harassment in relation to any person or persons mentioned or described in the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz’s counterclaim is pleaded by reference to Dr Garrett’s alleged responsibility for the sockpuppet course of conduct. For the reasons I have already given, I cannot make the necessary findings of fact on which that allegation inevitably relies. The counterclaim as pleaded necessarily fails for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the trial hearing, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz also made extensive and sustained submissions objecting to the manner in which Dr Garrett and his legal team have been conducting this litigation against them. It is plain that they have both, in general, found the experience of being proceeded against for libel intrusive, frightening and intimidatory. I was told that they experienced it as motivated by an intention to harm them and their websites financially, and to interfere with their investigative journalism. They objected specifically to Dr Garrett’s having made contact with their internet service provider and other web hosts in an attempt to have the publications taken down, to the obtaining of their postal and online contact details, to the threatening tone of solicitors’ correspondence, to the conduct of the disclosure process, to the conduct by the same firm of solicitors of a second set of proceedings against them which Dr and Mrs Schestowitz had unsuccessfully sought to have consolidated with Dr Garrett’s claim, and to a reference made in formal documentation to a previous name of Mrs Schestowitz, a matter to which she took extremely strong exception. They felt, in short, that they had been ‘harassed’ by this litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I emphasise that none of this formed any part of their counterclaim as pleaded, nor is it evidenced, and I am not as a result in any proper position to make any findings of liability in harassment based on it. I also had to explain the constraints of legal professional privilege on some of the matters Dr and Mrs Schestowitz wanted to explore with Dr Garrett and his solicitor under cross-examination, in relation to their counterclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to record also that Dr Garrett in turn takes strong exception to the manner in which Dr Schestowitz has himself conducted this litigation as a litigant in person. Mr Hamer referred to what he considered to be racist attacks on Dr Garrett’s lawyers, posted on Techrights, which he described as probably the worst example he had seen of such conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this may need to be explored further if and when it comes to the stage of dealing with the costs of this litigation. That is a matter on which the parties will need to reflect following hand-down of this judgment. It may be that formal submissions and witness evidence may in due course be needed to resolve it. But none of it is properly relevant to the determination of liability on the counterclaim as pleaded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the reasons I have given, I cannot be satisfied that, more probably than not, Dr Garrett was responsible for the course of conduct comprising the sockpuppet trolling. The counterclaim must fail accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remedies&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Libel damages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The starting point for any award of damages in any tort is that the court should award a sum of money which will, as nearly as possible, restore the injured party to the same position he would have been in had the tort never been committed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the nature and history of libel, and its focus on reputational harm and the restorative vindication of reputation, has resulted in the evolution of a distinctive approach to assessing damages for defamation. As Nicklin J observed in Monir v Wood [2018] EWHC 3525 QB at [228], ‘Damages for libel cannot be calculated on any mathematical basis. By definition, they seek to provide compensation for harm that it is almost impossible to quantify in monetary terms’. The exercise is necessarily therefore a broad and holistic one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is further underlined by Nicklin J in his observations in Lachaux v Independent Print[2021] EWHC 1797 (QB) at [227] about claims for aggravated damages in defamation (of which this is one):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In my judgment, separating out a specific award for aggravated damages is unnecessary and, I consider, generally unwise. The Court’s task is to assess the proper level of compensation, taking into account all the relevant factors, which include any elements of aggravation. If, as the authorities recognise, the assessment of libel damages can never be mechanical or scientific, attributing a specific figure to something as nebulous as aggravation has an unconvincing foundation. Worse, as it would represent the imposition of a clearly identified additional sum of money, it risks the appearance of being directly attributed to the conduct of the defendant. That comes perilously close to looking like a penalty. For these reasons, I consider the better course is to fix a single award which, faithful to the principles by which damages in defamation are assessed, is solely to compensate the Claimant. The award can properly reflect any additional hurt and distress caused to the Claimant by the conduct of the Defendants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as being broad and holistic, the exercise is also highly fact-specific. But the framework of principle does include maintaining broad comparability within the tort and between torts. So regard may be had to other awards in defamation cases of a comparable nature (although the authorities emphasise that no two defamation cases are ever really the same). Regard may also be had to the (very differently assessed) awards in personal injury cases to ensure that damages for defamation are, and are seen to be, proportionate and realistic. But these comparative exercises are by way of guidance only, and the focus must remain, intensely, on the circumstances of the individual case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relevant legal principles particularly applicable to assessing libel damages were set out clearly by Warby J (as he then was) in Sloutsker v Romanova[2015] EWHC 2053 at [74]-[82], and in Barron v Vines [2016] EWHC 1226 at [20]-[21]. Broadly, the purpose of an award of damages in defamation proceedings is to compensate for injury to reputation and to feelings, and in particular to vindicate claimants, so far as money can to do that. Vindication and compensation are not to be thought of in compartmentalised terms: the overall purpose of the award remains to restore a claimant, to the extent money can do so, to the position as if the libel had not occurred. But in defamation cases that means not only redressing the balance in terms of quantifiable losses, but unequivocally, albeit proportionately, restoring a claimant’s standing to its previous state. As the authorities put it, the sum awarded must be an outward and visible sign of vindication, sending a message restoring a claimant’s good name ‘sufficient to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the charge’. If an award fails to achieve vindication, it fails properly to compensate and restore the status quo ante.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In assessing damages, the court takes account of all the relevant facts, and in particular the gravity of the defamation, the extent of its publication, and evidence of the harm it has done. The award must in the end be no more than is justified by the legitimate aim of protecting reputation, necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of that aim, and proportionate to that need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Injunctive relief&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Injunctive relief is regularly afforded to successful defamation claimants, to restrain the publication of the same or similar libel. Final injunctive relief, restraining publication post-judgment, is distinctively different from pre-trial interim relief, since the implication of the judgment is necessarily that the published libel is not a species of free speech protected by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Nicklin J’s observation about permanent, post-judgment, injunction in Lachauxat [239] was that ‘it is the natural remedy that flows from the Court’s decision’, and, in the absence of satisfactory undertakings, it may be necessary to injunct further publication to give full effect to that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, importantly, it remains a discretionary remedy. It is not available as of right. In considering whether to exercise its discretion, and if so how, a court will have regard to all the circumstances of a case, including the conduct of the parties, and will focus in particular on assessing the risk of repetition of the defamation should injunctive relief not be granted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Order for publication of judgment summary&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Section 12 of the Defamation Act 2013 provides as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Power of court to order a summary of its judgment to be published&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Where a court gives judgment for the claimant in an action for defamation the court may order the defendant to publish a summary of the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The wording of any summary and the time, manner, form and place of its publication are to be for the parties to agree.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the parties cannot agree on the wording, the wording is to be settled by the court.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(4)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the parties cannot agree on the time, manner, form or place of publication, the court may give such directions as to those matters as it considers reasonable and practicable in the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(5)…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As confirmed by Monir v Wood at [239]-[242], the power to order publication of a judgment summary is itself a distinct incursion into a defendant’s rights to freedom of expression, protected by Article 10 of the ECHR, and must be exercised mindfully of that. The incursion involved must be justified by reference to the legitimate aim of protecting reputation, and necessary and proportionate to that aim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantum of damages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most significant relevant factors in the present case seem to me to be these.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, there is the gravity of the libellous allegations in this case which, in multiple and detailed respects, profoundly impugn Dr Garrett’s personal integrity, social standing and professional credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, there is the fact that they were published from websites regarded as authoritative and reliable, and repeatedly, to the very audience – including the free software community in England – in which Dr Garrett’s reputation here is most deeply invested, and which has the highest capacity to think the worse of him as a result. This was a substantial audience estimated to be of the order of at least thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, there is the fact that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz have insisted on the truth of their allegations all the way to trial, have offered no evidence for it, have refused to take down the material complained of and have made no retraction of or apology for the content. They appear to have thought that this was a point of journalistic principle and integrity, but they do not appear to have engaged in that capacity with the need or desirability for doing more, when faced with Dr Garrett’s assurances that he had nothing to do with the sockpuppet accounts, than simply dismissing them as probable lies. Mrs Schestowitz did however, in her closing submissions at trial, offer Dr Garrett an apology to the extent of having hurt his feelings. I thought that was at least well-intentioned and genuine, and I give her credit for it. I note also that, while Dr Schestowitz challenged Dr Garrett hard in a range of matters under cross-examination, he did so courteously and without directly maintaining the underlying truth of the content of the allegations beyond those of his responsibility for the trolling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, I note Dr Garrett’s evidence that the libels have caused him to fear for his professional and academic reputation, for the security of his employment and for his future employment prospects. He has had experience of being approached directly by a colleague and a former colleague over the content of the publications and had to defend himself, and has suffered the natural anxiety and humiliation of wondering what others are thinking of him and whether he may be being avoided or overlooked for opportunities because of what has been said about him. I bear in mind also that he does not suggest there is evidence to date that he has suffered actual employment detriment, and I note the strength of his professional reputation and the extent to which that might be able in itself to be robust to the depredations of gossip and rumour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr Hamer asks for a single global sum to vindicate Dr Garrett’s reputation and compensate him for distress in relation to all the publications complained of. He proposed a range of comparator decisions for my consideration, in support of a submission that libel damages approaching £100,000 would be appropriate. I have considered these. I noted in particular the case of Fentiman v Marsh [2019] EWHC 2099 in which an award of £55,000 was made in respect of allegations in a blog read by about 500 people that the claimant, a company CEO, was a hacker responsible for illegal cyber-attacks on a company. The tone of the allegations there were something comparable to those in the present case – somewhat personally and floridly put. I hold the effects of inflation in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my judgment, in all these circumstances, the minimum sum necessary to convince a fair-minded bystander of the baselessness of the allegations against him, to vindicate his reputation and restore his standing, and to compensate him for the consequences he has suffered, is £70,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Injunctive Relief&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz continue to publish and republish the libels. They have no entitlement to do so. This is not a form of freedom of expression which is protected by law. They have published further similar defamatory statements since the commencement of these proceedings. In the absence of any indication that they will voluntarily desist, remove the material objected to, and give satisfactory undertakings not to repeat the same or similar allegations, they face being compelled to do so by means of an injunction enforceable by proceedings for contempt of court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Section 12 Order&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A principal consideration in deciding whether to exercise the discretion to compel publication of a summary of a libel judgment is whether it is likely to be effective in coming to the attention of those to whom the original libel was published, and therefore in undoing its original reputational harm and vindicating the claimant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publication of a short summary of this judgment on Techrights and Tuxmachines would, in my view, be likely to be effective in reaching the UK audience to which the libels were published. It would be a clear statement to the free software community here that Dr Garrett cannot be regarded as having any stain on his character arising out of the accusations carried by those websites and complained of in these proceedings. That would, in my judgment, be a necessary and proportionate means of vindicating and protecting his reputation and rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decision&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett’s claim in defamation succeeds. He is entitled to the vindication of this judgment, and to the remedies I have indicated. The counterclaim of Dr and Mrs Schestowitz in harassment is dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz experienced appalling anonymous abuse, threats and harassment online. They reacted by using their websites – well-established, respected and trusted in the free software community, and carrying their own personal authority as free software activists – to blame and upbraid Dr Garrett for being responsible for this, and to vilify him accordingly. They have been unable to establish any recognisable basis in law for doing so. They have advanced no evidence for it; I was shown nothing in these proceedings capable of establishing in a court of law that Dr Garrett was in fact responsible or had anything to do with it. Their own campaign of allegations is not in these circumstances a lawful exercise of free speech, much less an example of investigative journalism. It is unsubstantiated character assassination and it must stop.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Firefox 147 Will Support The XDG Base Directory Specification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; A 21 year old bug report requesting support of the XDG Base Directory specification is finally being addressed by Firefox. The Firefox 147 release should respect this XDG specification around where files should be positioned within Linux users' home directory. &lt;lb/&gt;The XDG Base Directory specification lays out where application data files, configuration files, cached assets, and other files and file formats should be positioned within a user's home directory and the XDG environment variables for accessing those locations. To date Firefox has just positioned all files under ~/.mozilla rather than the likes of ~/.config and ~/.local/share.&lt;lb/&gt;Back in September 2004 this bug report was opened to support the FreeDesktop.org XDG Base Directory specification.&lt;lb/&gt;Merged this morning was the support for this specification and associated commits.&lt;lb/&gt;In turn this long-open bug is now closed and Firefox 147 should be the version to finally support the XDG Base Directory specification for jiving more nicely with other Linux apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Nano Banana Pro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a few months ago we released Nano Banana, our Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model. From restoring old photos to generating mini figurines, Nano Banana was a big step in image editing that empowered casual creators to express their creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image), our new state-of-the art image generation and editing model. Built on Gemini 3 Pro, Nano Banana Pro uses Gemini’s state-of-the-art reasoning and real-world knowledge to visualize information better than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Nano Banana Pro helps you bring any idea or design to life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nano Banana Pro can help you visualize any idea and design anything - from prototypes, to representing data as infographics, to turning handwritten notes into diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Nano Banana Pro, now you can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generate more accurate, context-rich visuals based on enhanced reasoning, world knowledge and real-time information&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Gemini 3’s advanced reasoning, Nano Banana Pro doesn’t just create beautiful images, it also helps you create more helpful content. You can get accurate educational explainers to learn more about a new subject, like context-rich infographics and diagrams based on the content you provide or facts from the real world. Nano Banana Pro can also connect to Google Search's vast knowledge base to help you create a quick snapshot for a recipe or visualize real-time information like weather or sports.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Banished Bottom of the Housing Market&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How America Destroyed Its Cheapest Homes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, a young man down on his luck in a new city is more likely to land in jail or on the street than on his feet. Fifty years ago, he had another option. A place to wash up, get a hot meal, meet other young men—even start over. All he had to do was put his pride on the shelf and get himself to—well, you can spell it out: the YMCA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Village People’s 1978 disco hit celebrated one of the less-remembered services offered by the YMCA. From the 1860s, the YMCA began building single-room occupancy (SRO) units “to give young men moving from rural areas safe and affordable lodging in the city.” At its peak in 1940, the YMCA had more than 100,000 rooms—“more than any hotel chain at the time.” The Y wasn’t the only provider of such housing; indeed, there was a vibrant market for hotel living that existed well into the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variously and derogatively known by many names—rooming houses, lodging houses, flophouses—SROs provided affordable, market-rate housing to those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. SROs were the cheapest form of residential hotels, specializing in furnished single rooms for individuals, usually with shared kitchens and bathrooms. A typical SRO rent in 1924 was $230 per month—in today’s dollars.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As late as 1990, as many as two million people lived in residential hotels—more than lived “in all of America’s public housing”—according to Paul Groth, author of Living Downtown.2 Today, not so much. SROs like those offered by the YMCA were the safety net that kept many people off the streets—and their disappearance from the housing supply explains much of modern-day homelessness. What we destroyed wasn’t just a housing type but an entire urban ecosystem: one that provided flexibility, independence, and affordability at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with so much of our urban history, this destruction was by design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, hotel living was a normal way of life for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. As hotelkeeper Simeon Ford colorfully put it in 1903, “We have fine hotels for fine people, good hotels for good people, plain hotels for plain people, and some bum hotels for bums.” SROs, the “bum hotels,” were the backbone of affordable housing, serving “a great army” of low-paid but skilled workers. Clustered in lively downtown districts with restaurants and services that acted as extensions of the home, SROs offered liberation from family supervision and the constraints of Victorian mores. Rooming house districts let young people mix freely and even allowed same-sex couples to live discreetly—signs of a more secular, modern urban culture. Downtown hotel life, Groth notes, “had the promise to be not just urban but urbane.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And therein lay the problem: the urbanity of SROs collided head-on with the moralism of the Progressive Era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reformers drew on a long tradition of anti-urban bias, seeing the emergent twentieth-century city as a problem, with cheap hotels at its heart. They pathologized hotel dwellers as “friendless, isolated, needy, and disabled” and cast SROs as “caldrons of social and cultural evil.” Some of the cheapest hotels were unsafe and exploitative, but reformers cared less about improving conditions than about what the hotels symbolized. They blamed rooming houses for loneliness, sexual licentiousness, civic apathy—even suicide. To them, the presence of “social misfits” proved that hotels caused moral disorder. In reality, people lived in SROs because they were cheap and offered greater independence—especially for career-oriented young women. Firm in their belief in the “One Best Way to live,” the reformers exalted the single-family home as the “bulwark of good citizenship” and succeeded in stigmatizing hotel life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the turn of the century, they set their sights on changing the law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning in the late 19th century, reformers used building and health codes to erase what they saw as “aberrant social lives.” San Francisco’s early building ordinances targeted Chinese lodging houses, while later codes outlawed cheap wooden hotels altogether. By the early 1900s, cities and states were classifying lodging houses as public nuisances. Other laws increased building standards and mandated plumbing fixtures, raising costs and slowing new construction. Urban reformers next embraced exclusionary zoning to separate undesirable people and noxious uses from residential areas. SROs were deemed inappropriate in residential zones, and many codes banned the mixed-use districts that sustained them. In cities like San Francisco, zoning was used to erect a “cordon sanitaire” around the prewar city “to keep old city ideas from contaminating the new.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Residential hotels, like apartments, were swept into the same category of “mere parasitic” uses that Euclid v. Ambler—the 1926 case that upheld zoning—treated as potential health hazards. Redlining and federal loan criteria starved urban hotels of capital, while planners simply omitted them from surveys and censuses—as if their residents didn’t exist. By the urban renewal era, the existence of the old city was itself seen as an affront, and it, too, had to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In effect, SROs became a “deliberate casualty” of the new city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic and policy shifts hastened their decline. Industrial jobs moved to peripheral locations only accessible by car, urban highway expansion targeted lodging-house neighborhoods, and cities encouraged office development on increasingly valuable downtown land. The “moral blight” of hotel districts had increasingly become economic blight, necessitating renewal. And because SROs didn’t count as “permanent housing” in official statistics, clearance programs could claim to displace no one. San Francisco’s urban renewal experience was typical: redevelopment in and around the Yerba Buena/Moscone Center area ultimately eliminated an estimated 40,000 hotel rooms. The public housing that replaced hotel districts—if it was built at all—often failed to accommodate single adults. To bureaucrats, the bulldozer was salubrious, “eliminating dead tissue” and “clearing away the mistakes of the past.” To the people who lived there, it wiped out their last foothold in the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the mid-twentieth century, “millions” of SRO hotel rooms disappeared through closures, conversions, and demolition across major cities, and the modest hotel market that remained was shrinking fast. With almost no new SROs built since the 1930s, the remaining stock was vanishing by the thousands in the 1970s. New York City had 200,000 SROs when it banned new hotel construction in 1955; only 30,000 remained by 2014. As tenants changed and land values climbed, owners who once fought to save their lodging houses now wanted out; it was officials who suddenly wanted to preserve them. Tenant movements and new government programs emerged in the 1970s and ’80s, but Reagan-era cuts gutted funding, and many remaining hotels decayed into the “street hotels” opponents had long imagined: unsanitary, unsafe, and unfit for all but the city’s most desperate residents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, demand for SRO housing was rising sharply. In the 1970s, states emptied mental hospitals without funding alternatives, pushing thousands of people with serious needs into cheap downtown hotels unequipped to support them. What was left of the SRO system became America’s accidental asylum network—the last rung of shelter for those the state had abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of people were barely hanging on, and a full-blown homelessness crisis had emerged in American cities for the first time since the Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SRO crisis was no accident, Groth argues, but the result of government policy at all levels that picked winners and losers in the housing market. The people we now call “chronically homeless” were once simply low-income tenants, housed by the private market in cheap rooms rather than by public programs. Once that market was dismantled, the result was predictable: the homelessness wave of the late 1970s and 1980s followed directly from the destruction of SROs. Today’s crisis—nearly 800,000 unhoused people in 2024—is the long tail of that loss, compounded by decades of underbuilding in expensive cities and soaring rents. As one advocate put it, “The people you see sleeping under bridges used to be valued members of the housing market. They aren’t anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Alex Horowitz of The Pew Charitable Trusts writes, if SROs had “grown since 1960 at about the same rate as the rest of the U.S. housing stock, the nation would have roughly 2.5 million more such units”—more than three times the number of homeless individuals. While we can’t rebuild the old SRO market we destroyed, cities now face a new opportunity: a vast surplus of obsolete office space that could be converted into inexpensive rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Horowitz argues cities should make shared housing—“co-living,” in today’s parlance—legal again. Office vacancies are soaring at the same time deeply affordable housing is vanishing. Horowitz and the architecture firm Gensler modeled what cities could actually build. Their analysis suggests that a vacant office tower could be converted into deeply affordable rooms for half the per-unit cost of new studio apartments. A typical 120–220 square foot unit with shared kitchens and bathrooms could rent to people earning 30–50% of area median income. Urban development has become so expensive that such conversions are likely to only be feasible if subsidized, but Horowitz argues that conversions offer a better way to leverage scarce public dollars: for instance, a $10 million budget might produce 125 co-living rooms instead of 35 studios, providing a way to scale deeply affordable housing much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a great idea—but in many cities, it’s illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While several cities have made efforts to undo SRO prohibitions, in many American metropolises, restrictions abound—from zoning that bans shared housing or residential uses in office districts to minimum-unit-size rules that outlaw SRO-scale rooms. Building codes with strict egress and corridor rules and ventilation requirements make conversions technically infeasible, while parking mandates add unnecessary costs. Meanwhile, “unrelated occupancy” limits prohibit the very household types SROs serve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these barriers is structural; every one is a policy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talk endlessly about the “missing middle.” But the real catastrophe was the “banished bottom”—the deliberate destruction of the cheapest rung of the housing ladder. Re-legalizing SROs won’t instantly restore a once deeply affordable housing market that provided housing at scale, but it would at least make it possible for cities to create a much cheaper form of housing that could benefit some of the 11 million extremely low-income renter households and the 800,000 homeless people in America. No city will meaningfully address the need for deeply affordable housing until it restores this missing rung—and accepts that not everyone needs a full apartment to have a full life. Surely, an SRO is better than a sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, while the YMCA is generally not in the SRO business anymore, its Austin branch is redeveloping itself as a mixed-use center with 90 deeply discounted affordable units for families. It’s a worthy project—but it highlights the gap: more than 80% of Austin’s homeless residents are single adults, the very group the Y once housed. We used to have a place they could go—but what happened to that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Y is as much a question as an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Stream processing without DSLs. Shareable, sandboxed, fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Documentation • Discord • Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tangent is a stream‑processing toolkit that treats plugins (user‑defined functions) as first‑class citizens – exceptionally easy to write and share. Perfect for vibe-coding those pesky log transformations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plugins run in a lightweight WASM sandbox with near-native speed and full language flexibility — no DSLs, no vendor-locked runtimes. Plugins are designed to be shareable, so common transformations (e.g. GuardDuty findings → OCSF) can be written once and shared with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tangent ships with everything you need to develop, test, and benchmark your own transforms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;tangent plugin scaffold&lt;/code&gt;– generate plugin boilerplate&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to sharing moments between family and friends, what device you have shouldn’t matter — sharing should just work. But we’ve heard from many people that they want a simpler way to share files between devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing a way for Quick Share to work with AirDrop. This makes file transfer easier between iPhones and Android devices, and starts rolling out today to the Pixel 10 family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built this with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that were tested by independent security experts. It’s just one more way we’re bringing better compatibility that people are asking for between operating systems, following our work on RCS and unknown tracker alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re looking forward to improving the experience and expanding it to more Android devices. See it in action on the Pixel 10 Pro in this video, and try it out for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The 2025 Go Cryptography State of the Union&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last August, I delivered my traditional Go Cryptography State of the Union talk at GopherCon US 2025 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It goes into everything that happened at the intersection of Go and cryptography over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can watch the video (with manually edited subtitles, for my fellow subtitles enjoyers) or read the transcript below (for my fellow videos not-enjoyers).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The annotated transcript below was made with Simon Willison’s tool. All pictures were taken around Rome, the Italian contryside, and the skies of the Northeastern United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Annotated transcript&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my annual performance review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are going to talk about all of the stuff that we did in the Go cryptography world during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I say "we," it doesn't mean just me, it means me, Roland Shoemaker, Daniel McCarney, Nicola Morino, Damien Neil, and many, many others, both from the Go team and from the Go community that contribute to the cryptography libraries all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to do this work at Google, and I now do it as an independent as part of and leading Geomys, but we'll talk about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we talk about the Go cryptography standard libraries, we talk about all of those packages that you use to build secure applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's what we make them for. We do it to provide you with encryption and hashes and protocols like TLS and SSH, to help you build secure applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main headlines of the past year:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We shipped post quantum key exchanges, which is something that you will not have to think about and will just be solved for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have solved FIPS 140, which some of you will not care about at all and some of you will be very happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the thing I'm most proud of: we did all of this while keeping an excellent security track record, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an update to something you've seen last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's the list of vulnerabilities in the Go cryptography packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don't assign a severity—because it's really hard, instead they're graded on the "Filippo's unhappiness score."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It goes shrug, oof, and ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time goes from bottom to top, and you can see how as time goes by things have been getting better. People report more things, but they're generally more often shrugs than oofs and there haven't been ouches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More specifically, we haven't had any oof since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We didn't have any Go-specific oof since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I say Go-specific, I mean: well, sometimes the protocol is broken, and as much as we want to also be ahead of that by limiting complexity, you know, sometimes there's nothing you can do about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we haven't had ouches since 2019. I'm very happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if this sounds a little informal, I'm also happy to report that we had the first security audit by a professional firm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trail of Bits looked at all of the nuts and bolts of the Go cryptography standard library: primitives, ciphers, hashes, assembly implementations. They didn't look at the protocols, which is a lot more code on top of that, but they did look at all of the foundational stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I'm happy to say that they found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two of a kind t-shirts, for me and Roland Shoemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is easy though to maintain a good security track record if you never add anything, so let's talk about the code we did add instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, post-quantum key exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talked about post-quantum last year, but as a very quick refresher:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post-quantum cryptography is about the future. We are worried about quantum computers that might exist… 5-50 (it's a hell of a range) years from now, and that might break all of asymmetrical encryption. (Digital signatures and key exchanges.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post-quantum cryptography runs on classical computers. It's cryptography that we can do now that resists future quantum computers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post-quantum cryptography is fast, actually. If you were convinced that for some reason it was slow, that's a common misconception.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;However, post-quantum cryptography is large. Which means that we have to send a lot more bytes on the wire to get the same results.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we focused on post-quantum key exchange because the key exchange defends against the most urgent risk, which is that somebody might be recording connections today, keeping them saved on some storage for the next 5-50 years and then use the future quantum computers to decrypt those sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm happy to report that we now have ML-KEM, which is the post-quantum key exchange algorithm selected by the NIST competition, an international competition run in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use it directly from the crypto/mlkem standard library package starting in Go 1.24, but you're probably not gonna do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, you're probably going to just use crypto/tls, which by default now uses a hybrid of X25519 and ML-KEM-768 for all connections with other systems that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why hybrid? Because this is new cryptography. So we are still a little worried that somebody might break it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was one that looked very good and had very small ciphertext, and we were all like, “yes, yes, that's good, that's good.” And then somebody broke it on a laptop. It was very annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're fairly confident in lattices. We think this is the good one. But still, we are taking both the old stuff and the new stuff, hashing them together, and unless you have both a quantum computer to break the old stuff and a mathematician who broke the new stuff, you're not breaking the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;crypto/tls can now negotiate that with Chrome and can negotiate that with other Go 1.24+ applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only that, we also removed any choice you had in ordering of key exchanges because we think we know better than you and— that didn't come out right, uh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;… because we assume that you actually want us to make those kind of decisions, so as long as you don't turn it off, we will default to post-quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can still turn it off. But as long as you don't turn it off, we'll default to the post-quantum stuff to keep your connection safe from the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same stuff with x/crypto/ssh. Starting in v0.38.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH does the same thing, they just put X25519 and ML-KEM-768 in a different order, which you would think doesn't matter—and indeed it doesn't matter—but there are rules where "no, no, no, you have to put that one first." And the other rule says "no, you have to put that one first." It's been a whole thing. I'm tired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSH supports it, so if you connect to a recent enough version of OpenSSH, that connection is post-quantum and you didn't have to do anything except update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but you said key exchanges and digital signatures are broken. What about the latter?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, key exchanges are urgent because of the record-now-decrypt-later problem, but unless the physicists that are developing quantum computers also develop a time machine, they can't use the QC to go back in time and use a fake signature today. So if you're verifying a signature today, I promise you it's not forged by a quantum computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a lot more time to figure out post-quantum digital signatures. But if we can, why should we not start now? Well, it's different. Key exchange, we knew what hit we had to take. You have to do a key exchange, you have to do it when you start the connection, and ML-KEM is the algorithm we have, so we're gonna use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signatures, we developed a lot of protocols like TLS, SSH, back when it was a lot cheaper to put signatures on the wire. When you connect to a website right now, you get five signatures. We can't send you five 2KB blobs every time you connect to a website. So we are waiting to give time to protocols to evolve, to redesign things with the new trade-offs in mind of signatures not being cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are kind of slow rolling intentionally the digital signature side because it's both not as urgent and not as ready to deploy. We can't do the same “ta-da, it's solved for you” show because signatures are much harder to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's talk about another thing that I had mentioned last year, which is FIPS 140.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FIPS 140 is a US government regulation for how to do cryptography. It is a list of algorithms, but it's not just a list of algorithms. It's also a list of rules that the modules have to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is a module?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, a module used to be a thing you would rack. All the rules are based on the idea that it's a thing you can rack. Then the auditor can ask “what is the module’s boundary?” And you're like, “this shiny metal box over here." And, you know, that works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people ask those questions of libraries, though, I do get a little mad every time. Like, what are the data input ports of your library? Ports. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's an interesting thing to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To comply with FIPS 140 in Go, up to now, you had to use an unsupported GOEXPERIMENT, which would replace all of the Go cryptography standard library, all of the stuff I'm excited about, with the BoringCrypto module, which is a FIPS 140 module developed by the BoringSSL folks. We love the BoringSSL folks, but that means using cgo, and we do not love cgo. It has memory safety issues, it makes cross-compilation difficult, it’s not very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the list of algorithms and platforms of BoringCrypto is tailored to the needs of BoringSSL and not to the needs of the Go community, and their development cycle doesn't match our development cycle: we don't decide when that module gets validated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of memory safety, I lied a little. Trail of Bits did find one vulnerability. They found it in Go+BoringCrypto, which was yet another reason to try to push away from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we've got now the FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only is it native Go, it's actually just a different name for the internal Go packages that all the regular Go cryptography package use for the FIPS 140 algorithms. We just moved them into their own little bubble so that when they ask us “what is the module boundary” we can point at those packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there's a runtime mode which enables some of the self-tests and slow stuff that you need for compliance. It also tells crypto/tls not to negotiate stuff that's not FIPS, but aside from that, it doesn't change any observable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We managed to keep everything working exactly the same: you don't import a different package, you don't do anything different, your applications just keep working the same way. We're very happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, you can at compile time select a GOFIPS140 frozen module, which is just a zip file of the source of the module as it was back when we submitted it for validation, which is a compliance requirement sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, that means we have to be forward compatible with future versions of Go, even for internal packages, which was a little spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can read more in the upstream FIPS 140-3 docs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be surprised to find out that using a FIPS 140 algorithm from a FIPS 140 module is not actually enough to be FIPS 140 compliant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS 140 module also has to be tested for that specific algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we did is we just tested them all, so you can use any FIPS 140 algorithm without worrying about whether it's tested in our module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I say we tested them all, I mean that some of them we tested with four different names. NIST calls HKDF alternatively SP 800-56C two-step KDF, SP 800-133 Section 6.3 CKG, SP 800-108 Feedback KDF, and Implementation Guidance D.P OneStepNoCounter KDF (you don't wanna know). It has four different names for the same thing. We just tested it four times, it's on the certificate, you can use it whatever way you want and it will be compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you use a FIFS 140 algorithm from a FIPS 140 module that was tested for the algorithm it's still not enough because it has to run on a platform that was tested as part of the validation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we tested on a lot of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of them were paid for by various Fortune 100s that had an interest in them getting tested, but some of them had no sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really wanted to solve this problem for everyone, once and for all, so Geomys just paid for all the FreeBSD, macOS, even Windows testing so that we could say “run it on whatever and it's probably going to be compliant.” (Don't quote me on that.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did we test on that many machines? Well, you know, we have this sophisticated data center…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Um, no. No, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got a bunch of stuff shipped to my place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's my NAS now. It's an Ampere Altra Q64-22, sixty-four arm64 cores, and yep, it's my NAS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I tested it on, you know, this sophisticated arm64 macOS testing platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then on the Windows one, which is my girlfriend's laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then the arm one, which was my router.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently I own an EdgeRouter now? It's sitting in the data center which is totally not my kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was all a very serious and regimented thing, and all of it is actually recorded, in recorded sessions with the accredited laboratories, so all this is now on file with the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might or might not be surprised to hear that the easiest way to meet the FIPS 140 requirements is not to exceed them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's annoying and a problem of FIPS 140 in general: if you do what everybody else does, which is just clearing the bar, nobody will ask questions, so there’s a strong temptation to lower security in FIPS 140 mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We just refused to accept that. Instead, we figured out complex stratagems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, for randomness, the safest thing to do is to just take randomness from the kernel every time you need it. The kernel knows if a virtual machine was just cloned and we don't, so we risk generating the same random bytes twice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But NIST will not allow that. You need to follow a bunch of standards for how the randomness is generated, and the kernel doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what we do is we do everything that NIST asks and then every time you ask for randomness, we squirrel off, go to the kernel, get a little piece of extra entropy, stir it into the pot before giving back the result, and give back the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's still NIST compliant because it's as strong as both the NIST and the kernel solution, but it took some significant effort to show it is compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did the same for ECDSA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ECDSA is a digital signature mechanism. We've talked about it a few other times. It's just a way to take a message and a private key and generate a signature, here (s, r).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make a signature, you also need a random number, and that number must be used only once with the same private key. You cannot reuse it. That number is k here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why can you not reuse it? Because if you reuse it, then you can do this fun algebra thing and then pop the private key falls out by just smashing two signatures together. Bad, really, really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we generate this number that must never be the same?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, one option is we make it random.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if your random number generator breaks and generates twice the same random number? That would leak the private key, and that would be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the community came up with deterministic ECDSA. Instead of generating the nonce at random, we are going to hash the message and the private key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is still actually a little risky though, because if there's a fault in the CPU, for example, or a bug, because for example you're taking the wrong inputs, you might still end up generating the same value but signing a slightly different message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we mitigate both of those? We do both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We take some randomness and the private key and the message, we hash them all together, and now it's really, really hard for the number to come out the same. That's called hedged ECDSA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Go crypto library has been doing hedged ECDSA from way before it was called hedged and way before I was on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except… random ECDSA has always been FIPS. Deterministic ECDSA has been FIPS since a couple years ago. Hedged ECDSA is technically not FIPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really didn't want to make our ECDSA package less secure, so we found a forgotten draft that specifies a hedged ECDSA scheme, and we proceeded to argue that actually if you read SP 800-90A Revision 1 very carefully you realize that if you claim that the private key is just the DRBG entropy plus two-thirds of the DRBG nonce, you are allowed to use it because of SP 800-57 Part 1, etc etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We basically just figured out a way to claim it was fine and the lab eventually said "okay, shut up." I'm very proud of that one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about this, check out the announcement blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know you need commercial services for FIPS 140, here’s Geomys FIPS 140 commercial services page. If you don't know if you need them, you actually probably don't. It's fine, the standard library will probably solve this for you now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but who cares about this FIPS 140 stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Dude, we've been talking about FIPS 140 for 10 minutes and I don't care about that."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I care because I spent my last year on it and that apparently made me the top committer for the cycle to the Go repo and that's mostly FIPS 140 stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know how to feel about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been actually a lot of positive side effects from the FIPS 140 effort. We took care to make sure that everything that we found we would leave in a better state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, there are new packages that moved from x/crypto into the standard library: crypto/hkdf, crypto/pbkdf, crypto/sha3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SHA-3 is faster and doesn't allocate anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HKDF has a new generic API which lets you pass in a function that returns either a concrete type that implements Hash or a function that returns a Hash interface, which otherwise was a little annoying. (You had to make a little closure.) I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We restructured crypto/aes and crypto/cipher and in the process merged a contribution from a community member that made AES-CTR, the counter mode, between 2 and 9 times faster. That was a pretty good result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The assembly interfaces are much more consistent now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we finished cleaning up crypto/rsa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you remember from last year, we made the crypto/rsa sign and verify operations not use math/big and use constant time code. Now we also made key generation, validation, and pre-computation all not use math/big.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That loading keys that were serialized to JSON a lot faster, and made key generation much faster. But how much faster?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benchmarking key generation is really hard because it's a random process: you take a number random number and you check, is it prime? No. Toss. Is it prime? Nope. Toss. Is it prime?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You keep doing this. If you're lucky, it’s very fast. If you are unlucky, very slow. It’s a geometric distribution and if you want to average it out, you have to run for hours. Instead, I figured out a new way by mathematically deriving the average number of pulls you are supposed to do and preparing a synthetic run that gives exactly the expected mean number of checks, so that we get a representative sample to benchmark deterministically. That was a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, we detect more broken keys, and we did a rare backwards compatibility break to stop supporting keys smaller than 1024 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1024 is already pretty small, you should be using 2048 minimum, but if you're using less than 1024, it can be broken on the proverbial laptop. It's kind of silly that a production library lets you do something so insecure, and you can't tell them apart just by looking at the code. You have to know what the size of the key is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we just took that out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expected people to yell at me. Nobody yelled at me. Good job community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from adding stuff, you know that we are very into testing and that testing is how we keep that security track record that we talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have one bug in particular that is my white whale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(You might say, "Filippo, well-adjusted people don't have white whales." Well, we learned nothing new, have we?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My white whale is this assembly bug that we found at Cloudflare before I joined the Go team. I spent an afternoon figuring out an exploit for it with Sean Devlin in Paris, while the yellow jackets set fire to cop cars outside. That's a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an assembly bug where the carry—literally the carry like when you do a pen and paper multiplication—was just not accounted for correctly. You can watch my talk Squeezing a Key through a Carry Bit if you are curious to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem with this stuff is that it's so hard to get code coverage for it because all the code always runs. It's just that you don't know if it always runs with that carry at zero, and if the carry was one, it’d do the wrong math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we've cracked it, by using mutation testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a framework that tells the assembler, "hey, anywhere you see an add-with-carry, replace it with a simple add that discards the carry." Then we run the tests. If the tests still pass, the test did not cover that carry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that happens we fail a meta-test and tell whoever's sending the CL, “hey, no, no, no, you gotta test that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same for checking the case in which the carry is always set. We replace the add-with-carry with a simple add and then insert a +1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a little tricky. If you want to read more about it, it's in this blog post. I'm very hopeful that will help us with all this assembly stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, accumulated test vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a little trick that I'm very very fond of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say you want to test a very large space. For example there are two inputs and they can both be 0 to 200 bytes long, and you want to test all the size combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That would be a lot of test vectors, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I checked in a megabyte of test vectors every time I wanted to do that, people eventually would yell at me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead what we do is run the algorithm with each size combination, and take the result and we put it inside a rolling hash. Then at the end we take the hash result and we check that it comes out right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do this with two implementations. If it comes out to the same hash, great. If it comes out not to the same hash, it doesn't help you figure out what the bug is, but it tells you there's a bug. I'll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really like reusing other people's tests. We're lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BoringSSL people have a fantastic suite of tests for TLS called BoGo and Daniel has been doing fantastic work integrating that and making crypto/tls stricter and stricter in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's now much more spec compliant on the little things where it goes like, “no, no, no, you're not allowed to put a zero here” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, the Let's Encrypt people have a test tool for the ACME protocol called Pebble. (Because it's a small version of their production system called Boulder! It took me a long time to figure it out and eventually I was like ooooohhh.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, NIST has this X.509 interoperability test suite, which just doesn't have a good name. It's good though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More assembly cleanups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There used to be places in assembly where—as if assembly was not complicated enough—instructions were just written down as raw machine code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes even the comment was wrong! Can you tell the comment changed in that patch? This is a thing Roland and Joel found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there's a test that will just yell at you if you try to commit a &lt;code&gt;WORD&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;BYTE&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also removed all the assembly that was specifically there for speeding up stuff on CPUs that don't have AVX2. AVX2 came out in 2015 and if you want to go fast, you're probably not using the CPU generation from back then. We still run on it, just not as fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More landings! I’m going to speed through these ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all stuff that we talked about last year and that we actually landed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stuff like data independent timing to tell the CPU, "no, no, I actually did mean for you to do that in constant time, goddammit."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And server-side TLS Encrypted Client Hello, which is a privacy improvement. We had client side, now we have server side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;crypto/rand.Read never fails. We promised that, we did that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, do you know how hard it is to test the failure case of something that never fails? I had to re-implement the seccomp library to tell the kernel to break the getrandom syscall to check what happens when it doesn’t work. There are tests all pointing guns at each other to make sure the fallback both works and is never hit unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also much faster now because Jason Donenfeld added the Linux getrandom VDSO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sean Liao added rand.Text like we promised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then more stuff like hash.Cloner, which I think makes a lot of things a little easier, and more and more and more and more. The Go 1.24 and Go 1.25 release notes are there for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;x/crypto/ssh is also under our maintenance and some excellent stuff happened there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better tests, better error messages, better compatibility, and we're working on some v2 APIs. If you have opinions, it’s time to come to those issues to talk about them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been an exciting year, and I'm going to give you just two samples of things we're planning to do for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is TLS profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately no one wants to specifically configure the fifteen different knobs of a TLS library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately no one—because I know there are some people who do and they yell at me regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But instead most people just want "hey, make it broadly compatible." "Hey, make it FIPS compliant." "Hey, make it modern."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're looking for a way to make it easy to just say what your goal is, and then we do all the configuration for you in a way that makes sense and that evolves with time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm excited about this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And maybe something with passkeys? If you run websites that authenticate users a bunch with password hashes and maybe also with WebAuthN, find me, email us, we want feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to figure out what to build here, into the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, so it's been a year of cryptography, but it's also been a year of Geomys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geomys launched a year ago here at GopherCon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want an update, we went on the Fallthrough podcast to talk about it, so check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are now a real company and how you know is that we have totes: it's the equivalent of a Facebook-official relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best FIPS 140 side effect has been that we have a new maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daniel McCarney joined us to help with the FIPS effort and then we were working very well together so Geomys decided to just take him on as a permanent maintainer on the Go crypto maintenance team. I’m very excited about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all possible thanks to our clients, and if you have any questions, here are the links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might also want to follow me on Bluesky at @filippo.abyssdomain.expert or on Mastodon at @filippo@abyssdomain.expert.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My work is made possible by Geomys, an organization of professional Go maintainers, which is funded by Smallstep, Ava Labs, Teleport, Tailscale, and Sentry. Through our retainer contracts they ensure the sustainability and reliability of our open source maintenance work and get a direct line to my expertise and that of the other Geomys maintainers. (Learn more in the Geomys announcement.) Here are a few words from some of them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Teleport — For the past five years, attacks and compromises have been shifting from traditional malware and security breaches to identifying and compromising valid user accounts and credentials with social engineering, credential theft, or phishing. Teleport Identity is designed to eliminate weak access patterns through access monitoring, minimize attack surface with access requests, and purge unused permissions via mandatory access reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ava Labs — We at Ava Labs, maintainer of AvalancheGo (the most widely used client for interacting with the Avalanche Network), believe the sustainable maintenance and development of open source cryptographic protocols is critical to the broad adoption of blockchain technology. We are proud to support this necessary and impactful work through our ongoing sponsorship of Filippo and his team.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello world, this is Abhay from Poly (&lt;/p&gt;https://poly.app&lt;p&gt;). We’re building an app to replace Finder/File Explorer with something more intelligent and searchable. Think of it like Dropbox + NotebookLM + Perplexity for terabytes of your files. Here’s a quick demo: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsqCySU4Ln0&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poly can search your content in natural language, across a broad range of file types and down to the page, paragraph, pixel, or point in time. We also provide an integrated agent that can take actions on your files such as creating, editing, summarizing, and researching. Any action that you can take, the agent can also take, from renaming, moving, tagging, annotating, and organizing files for you. The agent can also read URLs, youtube links, and can search the web and even download files for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some public drives that you can poke around in (note: it doesn’t work in Safari yet—sorry! we’re working on it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every issue of the Whole Earth Catalogue: https://poly.app/shared/whole-earth-catalogues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archive of old Playstation Manuals: https://poly.app/shared/playstation-manuals-archive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini archive of Orson Welles interviews and commercial spots: https://poly.app/shared/orson-welles-archive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archive of Salvador Dali’s paintings for Alice in Wonderland: https://poly.app/shared/salvador-dali-alice-in-wonderland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To try it out, navigate to one of these public folders and use the agent or search to find things. The demo video above can give you an idea of how the UI roughly works. Select files by clicking on them. Quick view by pressing space. Open the details for any file by pressing cmd + i. You can search from the top middle bar (or press cmd + K), and all searches will use semantic similarity and search within the files. Or use the agent from the bottom right tools menu (or press cmd + ?) and you can ask about the files, have the agent search for you, summarize things, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to build this after launching an early image-gen company back in March 2022, and realizing how painful it was for users to store, manage, and search their libraries, especially in a world of generative media. Despite our service having over 150,000 users at that point, we realized that our true calling was fixing the file browser to make it intelligent, so we shut our service down in 2023 and pivoted to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think Poly will be a great fit for anyone that wants to do useful things with their files, such as summarizing research papers, finding the right media or asset, creating a shareable portfolio, searching for a particular form or document, and producing reports and overviews. Of course, it’s a great way to organize your genAI assets as well. Or just use it to organize notes, links, inspo, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, Poly is built on our advanced search model, Polyembed-v1 that natively supports multimodal search across text, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, audio, video, PDFs, and more. We allow you to search by phrase, file similarity, color, face, and several other kinds of features. The agent is particularly skilled at using the search, so you can type in something like “find me the last lease agreement I signed” and it can go look for it by searching, reading the first few files, searching again if nothing matches, etc. But the quality of our embed model means it almost always finds the file in the first search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works identically across web and desktop, except on desktop it syncs your cloud files to a folder (just like google drive). On the web we use clever caching to enable offline support and file conflict recovery. We’ve taken great pains to make our system faster than your existing file browser, even if you’re using it from a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;File storage plans are currently at: 100GB free tier, paid tier is 2TB at $10/m, and 1c per GB per month on top of the 2TB. We also have rate limits for agent use that vary at different tiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to expand with many features over the following months, including “virtual files” (store your google docs in Poly), sync from other hosting providers, mobile apps, an MCP ecosystem for the agent, access to web search and deep research modes, offline search, local file support (on desktop), third-party sources (WebDAV, NAS), and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our waitlist is now open and we’ll be letting folks in starting today! Sign up at https://poly.app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d also love to hear your thoughts (and concerns) about what we’re building, as we’re early in this journey so your feedback can very much shape the future of our company!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
