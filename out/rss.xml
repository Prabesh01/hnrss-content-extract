  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A stateful SWD protocol implementation for debugging RP2350 RISC-V cores (Hazard3) from any Raspberry Pi Pico2 (target) using GPIO's on another Pico (probe).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 80% of the code is vibe coded; The readme is almost completely generated (except the whole vibe-code-warning section). I spent many nights with the oscilloscope and the docs and made a working prototype that was able ti do sba/read/write regs and do abstract commands and progbuf, the rest was done with claude code. The tests are quite comprehensive test suite and I use the core of the library in my own projects, but, as they say, "hic sunt dracones". I also read the readme and the code didn't notice anything wrong (and removed the wrong/unclear parts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project was my casestudy of vibecoding a more complicated project that I dont understand 100% and there is no obvious existing code that can be "used". It started as ~1000 loc that I have written and knew very well, reading the rp2350, arm swd and riscv debug docs, capturing data with oscilloscope and openocd then decoding it and analyzing the wakeup sequence and then read/write commands. After I got it working I gave it to claude to make it into a library that I can use in other projects, and then I slowly built it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After about 3-4k lines of code I completely lost track of what is going on, and I woudn't consider this code that I have written, but adding more and more tests felt "nice", or at least reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a some gaslighting, particularly when it misunderstood dap_read_mem32 thinking it is reading from ram and not MEM-AP TAR/DRW/RDBUFF protocol, which lead to incredible amount of nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall I would say it was a horrible experience, even though it took 10 hours to write close to 10000 lines of code, I don't consider this my project, and I have no sense of acomplishment or growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, using AI to read all the docs (which are thousands of pages) and write helpful scripts to decode the oscilloscope data, create packed C structs from docs and etc, was very nice, and I did feel good after. The moment I read the first register and then when I was able to read memory via SBA I felt amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main issue is &lt;code&gt;taste&lt;/code&gt;, when I write code I feel if its good or bad, as I am writing it, I know if its wrong, but using claude code I get desensitized very quickly and I just can't tell, it "reads" OK, but I don't know how it feels. In this case it happened when the code grew about 4x, from 1k to 4k lines. And worse of all, my mental model of the code is completely gone, and with it my ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tokens have no reason or purpose, which makes reading code ridiculously difficult, as and each token can be complete nonsense. When reading human code the symbols have a purpose, someone thought "I will put this in a variable, later I will check its status.", so I pretend I am them, and think &lt;code&gt;why&lt;/code&gt; would they have written this? Shortly after I understand, as they are human and I am human. But the AI symbols have no reason, and worse of all, they all look deceptively correct, so I have to think 10 times harder if it is wrong. With any human code (including your own) it is quite easy to gauge how much you can trust it, and it is quite consistent, with the AI code, one function can be much better than what you woudld've written, and the code 2 lines below can be cargo culted gunk that looks incredibly good, but is structurally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end I would say I have gained good understanding of the wires, timings, and the lower level ap/dp mechanics, sba and progbuf, but I regret not writing the whole thing myself, even if it would've taken 10x the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I fucking hate this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I can not help, but feel dusgust and shame. Is this what programming is now? I really hope this is some intermediate stage and it changes for the better, the problem is I dont know what "better" is, it seems for some people is not writing the code, for others is not modeling the problem and for third is not having to think. For me, I am not sure, I do want to make things, and many times I dont want to know something, but I want to use it, e.g. the rp2350 usb host controller the way you have to re-arm interrupts and the way the epx register is shared is super annoying, for good reasons probably, but I just want to use it to make my CBI driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess the question is what is the thing I want to make, because you can go way up the stack, from the USB chip registers to CBI to UFI to FAT16 to the OS of the old school computer I am making, but why stop? make the schematics, the pcbs, the cad files, maybe automatically send it to the factory? and then just ship it to me? but why stop? make my webshop, start selling, make a community, ads, marketing, generate some unboxing videos, maybe some viral memes? process the orders directly to the factory, on demand, if there is an issue, it is ready with customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do I do in the meanwhile? Sit on the beach? I hate the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where does it stop?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This library implements a complete three-layer abstraction for Serial Wire Debug protocol communication with RP2350's RISC-V Debug Module, modeled after the Debug Access Port specification and informed by ARM Debug Interface Architecture Specification v5.2.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The separation of concerns follows classical protocol stack design: each layer exposes a well-defined interface and maintains independent state, with lower layers unaware of higher-layer semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before examining the protocol implementation, we must establish the theoretical foundations of RISC-V external debugging. This section develops the debug architecture from first principles, following the RISC-V External Debug Support Specification v0.13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A RISC-V hart (hardware thread) exists in one of three abstract states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;State 1: RUNNING - The hart executes instructions from main memory. PC advances according to program flow. All architectural state (GPRs, CSRs, memory) is accessible to the executing program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;State 2: HALTED - The hart has entered debug mode. No instructions from main memory execute. The hart is "parked" in a special debug ROM or implicit debug loop within the Debug Module. Debug-specific CSRs (DPC, DCSR, DSCRATCH) become accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;State 3: RESUMING - A transient state where the hart has received a resume request but has not yet returned to normal execution. This state exists to model the asynchronous nature of resume operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debug Module (DM) is a hardware block separate from the hart itself. It acts as a "shadow controller" that can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Observe hart state without halting (DMSTATUS register)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Command hart transitions (halt, resume, reset via DMCONTROL)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access hart registers when halted (abstract commands)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access system memory independently of hart state (System Bus Access)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DM is itself controlled by an external debugger via a Debug Transport Module (DTM). In our case, the DTM is the SWD interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a hart enters debug mode, it is not simply "stopped." Rather, it enters a special execution context analogous to an exception handler:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PC is saved to DPC (Debug Program Counter, CSR 0x7b1)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Privilege level is elevated to M-mode (Machine mode, highest privilege)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DCSR.cause records the entry reason (halt request, ebreak, trigger, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hart begins executing from the debug exception vector (typically in debug ROM)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The debug exception vector contains a tight polling loop that repeatedly checks for commands from the Debug Module. This loop is architecturally invisible to the debugger—we simply observe the hart as "halted."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Abstract Command mechanism provides a hardware-implemented function call interface. Each abstract command is a 32-bit word written to the COMMAND register that encodes:&lt;/p&gt;

aarsize: Access size (2 = 32-bit)
aarpostincrement: Ignored
postexec: Execute program buffer after transfer
transfer: Perform the transfer (1=yes)
write: Direction (1=write, 0=read)
regno: Register number (0x1000-0x101f for GPRs x0-x31)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debug Module hardware interprets this command and performs the register access autonomously. From the debugger's perspective, this is a synchronous operation: write COMMAND, poll ABSTRACTCS.busy until clear, read result from DATA0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Program Buffer (PROGBUF) is a small instruction memory (2-16 entries) within the Debug Module. When abstract commands cannot accomplish a task (e.g., accessing debug-only CSRs), the debugger can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write RISC-V instructions to PROGBUF&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issue an abstract command with the &lt;code&gt;postexec&lt;/code&gt;bit set&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The hart executes PROGBUF instructions while still in debug mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The final &lt;code&gt;ebreak&lt;/code&gt;instruction returns control to the Debug Module&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a "code injection" attack—the hart never leaves debug mode. It's analogous to a debugger writing instructions into a trap handler's stack frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SBA provides a second path to memory that bypasses the hart entirely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hart and SBA compete for memory bus bandwidth. The hart's view of memory may differ from SBA's view due to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cache: Hart caches writes; SBA sees stale memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MMU/PMP: Hart accesses are translated/protected; SBA bypasses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Atomicity: Hart's atomic operations (LR/SC) are invisible to SBA&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a bug—it's a fundamental architectural trade-off. SBA provides speed and non-intrusiveness at the cost of coherency guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RISC-V debugging rests on several invariants:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invariant 1: Debug Mode is Atomic While in debug mode, the hart executes no instructions from main memory. The debugger has exclusive control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invariant 2: Architectural Transparency Entering and exiting debug mode does not change architected state (except DPC/DCSR). The program cannot detect it was halted (modulo real-time constraints).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invariant 3: Debug Privilege Debug mode executes at maximum privilege (M-mode). All memory is accessible, all CSRs are readable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invariant 4: No Interrupts in Debug Interrupts are masked while in debug mode. The debugger must explicitly re-enable them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These invariants enable reproducible debugging: halting twice at the same PC should show identical state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is a 2-wire replacement for JTAG's 5-wire interface, developed by ARM. The protocol operates over two signals:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SWCLK: Clock signal driven by the debugger (host)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SWDIO: Bidirectional data signal with turnaround phases&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each SWD transaction consists of three phases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Request Phase (8 bits, host drives SWDIO):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Bit 0: Start (always 1) Bit 1: APnDP (0=DP access, 1=AP access) Bit 2: RnW (0=Write, 1=Read) Bit 3-4: A[3:2] (register address bits) Bit 5: Parity (even parity of bits 1-4) Bit 6: Stop (always 0) Bit 7: Park (always 1)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Acknowledge Phase (3 bits, target drives SWDIO):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;OK (001): Transaction accepted WAIT (010): Target requests retry FAULT (100): Error condition&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Data Phase (33 bits, direction depends on RnW):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Bits 0-31: Data word Bit 32: Parity bit&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turnaround cycles (host releases SWDIO, target can drive) occur between request→ack and during data phase direction changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our implementation of the packet construction is in &lt;code&gt;swd_protocol.c:97-113&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static uint8_t make_swd_request(bool APnDP, bool RnW, uint8_t addr) {
    uint8_t a2 = (addr &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2) &amp;amp; 1;
    uint8_t a3 = (addr &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 3) &amp;amp; 1;
    uint8_t parity = (APnDP + RnW + a2 + a3) &amp;amp; 1;

    uint8_t request = 0;
    request |= (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0);          // Start bit
    request |= (APnDP &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1);      // AP/DP select
    request |= (RnW &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2);        // Read/Write
    request |= (a2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3);         // Address bit 2
    request |= (a3 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4);         // Address bit 3
    request |= (parity &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 5);     // Parity
    request |= (0 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 6);          // Stop bit
    request |= (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 7);          // Park bit
    return request;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike software bit-banging (which suffers from timing jitter and CPU overhead), this implementation uses RP2040/RP2350's Programmable I/O (PIO) blocks for deterministic timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PIO program (&lt;code&gt;swd.pio&lt;/code&gt;) implements a command-based interface where each FIFO entry encodes either a command or data payload. Command format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Bits 0-7:   Bit count - 1
Bit 8:      Direction (0=input, 1=output)
Bits 9-13:  Target instruction address
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state machine operates at 4 cycles per clock period, providing precise SWCLK generation independent of system clock frequency. See &lt;code&gt;swd.pio:45-68&lt;/code&gt; for the complete implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clock divider calculation (&lt;code&gt;swd_protocol.c:313-330&lt;/code&gt;) accounts for this 4-cycle period:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t clk_sys_khz = clock_get_hz(clk_sys) / 1000;
uint32_t divider = (((clk_sys_khz + freq_khz - 1) / freq_khz) + 3) / 4;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ARM Debug Interface Architecture v6 introduces a Dormant State to enable coexistence of multiple debug protocols (JTAG and SWD) on the same pins. At power-up, RP2350's SW-DP enters the Dormant state, requiring explicit activation before SWD operations can proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dormant state solves a fundamental problem: JTAG uses 5 signals (TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO, TRST), while SWD uses 2 (SWCLK, SWDIO). When both protocols share physical pins, the debug port must determine which protocol the debugger intends to use. The solution is to require a protocol-specific "unlock" sequence that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cannot be generated accidentally by non-debug traffic on the pins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is sufficiently long to avoid false positives (128 bits)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Uniquely identifies the target protocol (JTAG vs SWD)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SW-DP implements a finite state machine with three protocol modes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once activated, the debug port remains in the selected protocol mode until:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A transition-to-dormant sequence is sent&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Power is cycled&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The external reset (RUN) pin is asserted&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before sending a protocol-specific activation code, ARM requires transmission of a 128-bit Selection Alert Sequence. This sequence serves as a "wake-up call" that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Synchronizes the target's bit-stream parser&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ensures the target is listening for an activation sequence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Provides sufficient entropy to avoid accidental activation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Selection Alert Sequence is a fixed 128-bit pattern defined in the ADI v6 specification:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;0x19bc0ea2_e3ddafe9_86852d95_6209f392 (transmitted LSB-first)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This constant was chosen for its Hamming distance properties—it is unlikely to occur in normal signal traffic or be generated by crosstalk, glitches, or other non-debug activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our implementation (&lt;code&gt;swd_protocol.c:357-382&lt;/code&gt;) uses a defensive activation strategy that ensures reliable connection regardless of the SW-DP's initial state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Phase 1: Exit any prior protocol mode
static const uint8_t seq_jtag_to_dormant[] = {
    0xff,0xff,0xff,0xff,0xff,0xff,0xff, 0xbc,0xe3
};

// Phase 2: Activate SWD mode
static const uint8_t seq_dormant_to_swd[] = {
    0xff,                                        // Line reset (8 ones)
    0x92,0xf3,0x09,0x62,0x95,0x2d,0x85,0x86,     // Selection Alert
    0xe9,0xaf,0xdd,0xe3,0xa2,0x0e,0xbc,0x19,     //   (128 bits)
    0xa0,0xf1,0xff,                              // SWD Activation Code (0x1a)
    0xff,0xff,0xff,0xff,0xff,0xff,0xff, 0xff,    // Line reset (&amp;gt;50 ones)
    0x00                                         // Idle low
};&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this two-phase approach?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that we don't know the SW-DP's current state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fresh power-up: SW-DP is in Dormant mode (default)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prior debug session: SW-DP may be in SWD or JTAG mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Failed connection attempt: SW-DP may be in an undefined state&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the SW-DP is already in SWD or JTAG mode, sending the Selection Alert Sequence will be interpreted as data transactions, potentially putting the DP into an error state. Our solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1: Force transition to Dormant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Send the JTAG-to-Dormant sequence (56 ones followed by 0xbc, 0xe3). This sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If in JTAG mode: transitions to Dormant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If in SWD mode: interpreted as line reset + invalid transactions (harmless)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If already Dormant: has no effect (dormant state ignores invalid input)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sequence consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;56 clock cycles high (JTAG TMS=1 → Test-Logic-Reset state)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;0x3cbe (0xbc, 0xe3 LSB-first): JTAG-specific exit pattern&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Activate SWD from Dormant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we're guaranteed to be in Dormant mode (or already in SWD mode where line reset is idempotent), we send:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line reset (8 ones): Clears any pending SWD transactions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Selection Alert Sequence (128 bits): Wakes dormant state machine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SWD Activation Code (0x1a, 8 bits): Selects SWD protocol&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line reset (&amp;gt;50 ones): Enters SWD Reset state, clearing sticky errors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Idle cycles: Ensures clean transition&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SWD Activation Code &lt;code&gt;0x1a&lt;/code&gt; decodes as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Bits[7:0] = 0x1a = 0b00011010
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This specific bit pattern was chosen to be distinct from valid JTAG TMS sequences, ensuring protocol disambiguation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RP2350 datasheet (Section 3.5.1) describes a simpler connection sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1. At least 8 × SWCLK cycles with SWDIO high
2. The 128-bit Selection Alert sequence
3. Four SWCLK cycles with SWDIO low
4. SWD activation code: 0x1a, LSB first
5. At least 50 × SWCLK cycles with SWDIO high (line reset)
6. A DPIDR read to exit the Reset state
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sequence assumes the SW-DP is in Dormant mode at power-up. However, in real-world scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The target may have been previously debugged (SW-DP in SWD mode)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A debugger crash may have left the SW-DP in an error state&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-drop SWD configurations may require explicit state reset&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our JTAG→Dormant→SWD sequence provides universal robustness: it works regardless of the SW-DP's initial state. The cost is negligible—approximately 100 extra clock cycles, taking ~100µs at 1 MHz SWCLK—while the benefit is reliable connection without manual power-cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After activation, we immediately read DP_IDCODE (&lt;code&gt;swd_protocol.c:386-397&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t idcode = 0;
err = swd_read_dp_raw(target, DP_IDCODE, &amp;amp;idcode);
if (err != SWD_OK) {
    swd_set_error(target, err, "Failed to read IDCODE");
    return err;
}

if ((idcode &amp;amp; 0x0fffffff) == 0) {
    swd_set_error(target, SWD_ERROR_PROTOCOL, "Invalid IDCODE: 0x%08x", idcode);
    return SWD_ERROR_PROTOCOL;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A successful IDCODE read confirms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SWD protocol is active&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The SW-DP is responding to transactions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The SWCLK frequency is within tolerance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SWDIO signal integrity is sufficient&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For RP2350, the IDCODE is &lt;code&gt;0x4c013477&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This defensive activation strategy, while not strictly necessary for fresh power-up scenarios, ensures our library works reliably across the full range of real-world debug connection scenarios—a critical property for a reusable debug library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debug Access Port (DAP) provides memory-mapped access to debug resources through two register banks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debug Port (DP) manages power domains and AP selection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DP_IDCODE (0x0): Designer and part number identification&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DP_CTRL_STAT (0x4): Power control and status flags&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DP_SELECT (0x8): AP and register bank selection&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DP_RDBUFF (0xC): Read buffer for pipelined AP reads&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access Ports (AP) provide interfaces to debug resources. RP2350 implements multiple APs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AP 0x0: ROM Table&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AP 0x2: ARM Core 0 AHB-AP&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AP 0x4: ARM Core 1 AHB-AP&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AP 0x8: RP2350-specific AP&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AP 0xA: RISC-V APB-AP (target of this library)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each AP has standardized registers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AP_CSW (0x00): Control/Status Word&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AP_TAR (0x04): Transfer Address Register&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AP_DRW (0x0C): Data Read/Write Register&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AP_IDR (0xFC): Identification Register&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard ARM DP_SELECT format uses bits[31:24] for APSEL and bits[7:4] for APBANKSEL. RP2350 implements a non-standard encoding (&lt;code&gt;dap.c:18-22&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t make_dp_select_rp2350(uint8_t apsel, uint8_t bank, bool ctrlsel) {
    // [15:12] = APSEL, [11:8] = 0xD, [7:4] = bank, [0] = ctrlsel
    return ((apsel &amp;amp; 0xF) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 12) | (0xD &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8) | ((bank &amp;amp; 0xF) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4) | (ctrlsel ? 1 : 0);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The magic constant 0xD in bits[11:8] is undocumented but required for correct AP selection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AP registers are accessed through a banking mechanism where DP_SELECT must be written before each AP access. To minimize SWD transactions, the library maintains a cache of the current bank selection (&lt;code&gt;dap.c:28-55&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static swd_error_t select_ap_bank(swd_target_t *target, uint8_t apsel, uint8_t bank) {
    if (target-&amp;gt;dap.current_apsel == apsel &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
        target-&amp;gt;dap.current_bank == bank &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
        target-&amp;gt;dap.ctrlsel == true) {
        return SWD_OK;  // Already selected
    }
    // Write DP_SELECT...
    target-&amp;gt;dap.current_apsel = apsel;
    target-&amp;gt;dap.current_bank = bank;
    // ...
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This caching reduces transaction count by approximately 50% in typical debug sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before any debug operations can proceed, the Debug Power Domain (DPD) and System Power Domain (SPD) must be powered up. This is not a physical power operation but rather clock and reset domain enabling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power-up sequence (&lt;code&gt;dap.c:61-110&lt;/code&gt;) follows the ARM Debug Interface specification:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear sticky errors: Write 0 to DP_CTRL_STAT&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Request power-up: Set CDBGPWRUPREQ (bit 28) and CSYSPWRUPREQ (bit 30)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Poll acknowledgment: Wait for CDBGPWRUPACK (bit 29) and CSYSPWRUPACK (bit 31)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t ctrl_stat = (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 28) | (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 30);
swd_write_dp_raw(target, DP_CTRL_STAT, ctrl_stat);

for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10; i++) {
    swd_read_dp_raw(target, DP_CTRL_STAT, &amp;amp;status);
    bool cdbgpwrupack = (status &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 29) &amp;amp; 1;
    bool csyspwrupack = (status &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 31) &amp;amp; 1;
    if (cdbgpwrupack &amp;amp;&amp;amp; csyspwrupack) {
        return SWD_OK;
    }
    sleep_ms(20);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Failure to complete this sequence results in all subsequent debug operations returning WAIT responses indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After DAP power-up, the RP2350-specific Debug Module must be initialized through an undocumented activation handshake. This sequence was reverse-engineered from OpenOCD's RP2350 support with an oscilloscope and patience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The activation sequence (&lt;code&gt;rp2350.c:106-194&lt;/code&gt;) consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t sel_bank0 = make_dp_select_rp2350(AP_RISCV, 0, true);
dap_write_dp(target, DP_SELECT, sel_bank0);

uint32_t csw = 0xA2000002;  // 32-bit access, auto-increment disabled
dap_write_ap(target, AP_RISCV, AP_CSW, csw);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debug Module registers are normally accessed through Bank 0, but activation requires Bank 1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t sel_bank1 = make_dp_select_rp2350(AP_RISCV, 1, true);
dap_write_dp(target, DP_SELECT, sel_bank1);

// Three-phase handshake
dap_write_ap(target, AP_RISCV, AP_CSW, 0x00000000);  // Reset
dap_read_dp(target, DP_RDBUFF);
sleep_ms(50);

dap_write_ap(target, AP_RISCV, AP_CSW, 0x00000001);  // Activate
dap_read_dp(target, DP_RDBUFF);
sleep_ms(50);

dap_write_ap(target, AP_RISCV, AP_CSW, 0x07FFFFC1);  // Configure
dap_read_dp(target, DP_RDBUFF);
sleep_ms(50);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The expected status response is &lt;code&gt;0x04010001&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RISC-V Debug Module implements the RISC-V External Debug Support specification v0.13. Debug Module registers are memory-mapped at base address 0x40 (register addresses are byte offsets × 4).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key registers (&lt;code&gt;rp2350.c:17-29&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define DM_DMCONTROL   (0x10 * 4)  // Hart control

#define DM_SBADDRESS0  (0x39 * 4)  // SBA Address
#define DM_SBDATA0     (0x3C * 4)  // SBA Data&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hart (hardware thread) execution is controlled through DMCONTROL register fields:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dmactive (bit 0): Debug Module active (must be 1)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;haltreq (bit 31): Request hart halt&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;resumereq (bit 30): Request hart resume&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Halt sequence (&lt;code&gt;rp2350.c:205-240&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t dmcontrol = (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 31) | (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0);  // haltreq | dmactive
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_DMCONTROL, dmcontrol);

// Poll DMSTATUS.allhalted (bit 9)
for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10; i++) {
    swd_result_t result = dap_read_mem32(target, DM_DMSTATUS);
    bool allhalted = (result.value &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 9) &amp;amp; 1;
    if (allhalted) {
        target-&amp;gt;rp2350.hart_halted = true;
        return SWD_OK;
    }
    sleep_ms(10);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abstract commands provide a high-level interface to hart state without halting. The COMMAND register format for GPR access:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Bits 0-15:   regno (0x1000 + reg_num for GPRs)
Bit 16:      write (1=write, 0=read)
Bit 17:      transfer (1=execute transfer)
Bits 20-22:  aarsize (2=32-bit access)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPR read implementation (&lt;code&gt;rp2350.c:333-389&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t command = 0;
command |= (0x1000 + reg_num) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0;    // regno
command |= (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 17);                  // transfer
command |= (2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 20);                  // aarsize=32-bit

dap_write_mem32(target, DM_COMMAND, command);
wait_abstract_command(target);  // Poll ABSTRACTCS.busy
result = dap_read_mem32(target, DM_DATA0);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Program Buffer (PROGBUF) is a 16-entry instruction memory within the Debug Module that enables execution of arbitrary RISC-V code in the debug context. Understanding its operation requires examining the execution model, register preservation semantics, and synchronization mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A RISC-V hart operates in one of two contexts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Normal Context: The hart executes from main memory, PC advances sequentially, and all architectural state is visible to the program.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Debug Context: Upon entering debug mode (via halt request, ebreak, or trigger), the hart:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Saves PC to DPC (Debug Program Counter, CSR 0x7b1)&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Enters a special execution mode where PROGBUF instructions execute&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Maintains all GPRs and CSRs in their pre-halt state&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Cannot access main memory without explicit instructions&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debug Module provides a "scratch pad" where debugger-supplied instructions execute with full access to hart state, but without disturbing that state beyond explicit modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RP2350's Debug Module provides 2 program buffer entries (PROGBUF0 and PROGBUF1), though the specification allows up to 16. Each entry holds one 32-bit RISC-V instruction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define DM_PROGBUF0  (0x20 * 4)  // First instruction
#define DM_PROGBUF1  (0x21 * 4)  // Second instruction (typically ebreak)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The execution model assumes the final instruction is &lt;code&gt;ebreak&lt;/code&gt; (0x00100073), which returns control to the Debug Module and makes the hart available for further debug operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abstract commands can trigger PROGBUF execution through the &lt;code&gt;postexec&lt;/code&gt; bit (bit 18 of the COMMAND register). This creates a transactional execution model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Debugger writes PROGBUF instructions  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Debugger writes DATA0 (optional)      │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Abstract command with postexec=1      │
│   - Transfers DATA0 → GPR (if transfer=1)│
│   - Executes PROGBUF[0]..PROGBUF[N]      │
│   - Executes ebreak (returns to DM)      │
│   - Transfers GPR → DATA0 (if transfer=1)│
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This mechanism eliminates race conditions: the data transfer and program execution form an atomic operation from the debugger's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debug Program Counter (DPC, CSR 0x7b1) cannot be accessed via abstract commands—it exists only in debug context and abstract commands target normal context registers. Reading DPC requires PROGBUF execution (&lt;code&gt;rp2350.c:804-833&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1: Preserve scratch register&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;swd_result_t saved_s0 = rp2350_read_reg(target, hart_id, 8);  // x8 = s0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RISC-V ABI designates s0 (x8) as a saved register, but we must preserve it because our PROGBUF code will clobber it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Write PROGBUF instructions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dap_write_mem32(target, DM_PROGBUF0, 0x7b102473);  // csrr s0, dpc
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_PROGBUF1, 0x00100073);  // ebreak&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The instruction &lt;code&gt;csrr s0, dpc&lt;/code&gt; (CSR Read) has the encoding:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;CSR 0x7b1: DPC is defined in RISC-V Debug Spec v0.13, section 4.8.2&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 3: Execute with postexec&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t command = (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 18);  // postexec=1, transfer=0
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_COMMAND, command);
wait_abstract_command(target);  // Poll ABSTRACTCS.busy&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hart now executes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;csrr s0, dpc&lt;/code&gt;→ DPC value loaded into s0&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ebreak&lt;/code&gt;→ Return to Debug Module, s0 contains DPC&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 4: Extract result via abstract command&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;result = rp2350_read_reg(target, hart_id, 8);  // Read s0 (now contains DPC)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 5: Restore architectural state&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;rp2350_write_reg(target, hart_id, 8, saved_s0.value);  // Restore s0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This five-phase sequence is invisible to the hart's normal execution: when resumed, all registers appear unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing DPC uses the inverse data flow (&lt;code&gt;rp2350.c:879-909&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Phase 1: Transfer new PC value to s0
err = rp2350_write_reg(target, hart_id, 8, new_pc_value);

// Phase 2: Write PROGBUF to copy s0 → DPC
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_PROGBUF0, 0x7b141073);  // csrw dpc, s0
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_PROGBUF1, 0x00100073);  // ebreak

// Phase 3: Execute
uint32_t command = (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 18);  // postexec=1
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_COMMAND, command);
wait_abstract_command(target);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The instruction &lt;code&gt;csrw dpc, s0&lt;/code&gt; (CSR Write) has encoding 0x7b141073:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;funct3=0x1 (CSRRW): CSR Read and Write. The old CSR value is discarded (rd=x0), and s0's value is written to DPC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PROGBUF execution environment imposes several constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Memory Access Limitation: PROGBUF instructions execute in debug mode, where memory access depends on Debug Module configuration. Standard loads/stores may fault.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instruction Count: With only 2 entries, complex operations require multiple PROGBUF sequences. Each sequence incurs the cost of abstract command execution (~100µs typical).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No Branching: PROGBUF is linear. Conditional execution requires host-side logic to decide which PROGBUF sequence to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Register Pressure: Only one scratch register (s0) is conventionally used. More complex operations require additional saves/restores.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebreak Requirement: The final instruction must be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ebreak&lt;/code&gt;. Omitting it causes the hart to hang in debug mode.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This execution model provides a "remote procedure call" mechanism where the host supplies short instruction sequences that execute atomically on the hart, providing a window into debug-only architectural state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System Bus Access (SBA) represents a fundamental departure from the traditional halt-based debugging model. Where classical debugging requires stopping the hart, transferring data through GPRs, and resuming, SBA provides a "back door" to the memory subsystem that operates concurrently with hart execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debug Module contains a bus master that can initiate memory transactions on the system bus independently of the harts. This master has the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Separate Bus Master: SBA transactions do not consume hart resources or execution time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Concurrent Operation: Memory reads/writes occur while harts execute normally&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cache Coherency Dependency: SBA bypasses hart caches; coherency is NOT guaranteed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bus Arbitration: SBA competes with harts for bus bandwidth&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SBA interface consists of three memory-mapped registers in the Debug Module:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define DM_SBCS        (0x38 * 4)  // System Bus Access Control and Status
#define DM_SBADDRESS0  (0x39 * 4)  // System Bus Address (32-bit)
#define DM_SBDATA0     (0x3C * 4)  // System Bus Data (32-bit)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SBCS register (offset 0x38) contains configuration and status fields defined in RISC-V Debug Spec v0.13.2, section 3.12.18:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;31:29 sbversion        (read-only)  SBA version
28:23 (reserved)       0
   22 sbbusyerror      (W1C)        Bus error occurred
   21 sbbusy           (read-only)  Bus master is busy
   20 sbreadonaddr     (read-write) Auto-read on SBADDRESS0 write
19:17 sbaccess         (read-write) Access width: 0=8-bit, 1=16-bit, 2=32-bit
   16 sbautoincrement  (read-write) Auto-increment address after access
   15 sbreadondata     (read-write) Auto-read on SBDATA0 read
14:12 sberror          (W1C)        Error status (0=none, 1=timeout, 2=bad addr, 3=alignment, 4=size, 7=other)
11:5  sbasize          (read-only)  Address width in bits (32 for RP2350)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SBA subsystem initialization (&lt;code&gt;rp2350.c:958-992&lt;/code&gt;) follows a capability discovery pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1: Read SBCS to detect supported features&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;swd_result_t result = dap_read_mem32(target, DM_SBCS);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Verify SBA capability&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Check sbasize field (bits [11:5]) to verify SBA is present
uint32_t sbasize = (result.value &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5) &amp;amp; 0x7F;
if (sbasize == 0) {
    return SWD_ERROR_INVALID_STATE;  // SBA not available
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sbasize&lt;/code&gt; field indicates the system bus address width (32 bits for RP2350). RP2350 supports 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit access widths. We configure for 32-bit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 3: Configure access mode&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t sbcs = 0;
sbcs |= (2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 17);  // sbaccess = 2 (32-bit)
sbcs |= (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 20);  // sbreadonaddr = 1 (auto-read trigger)
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_SBCS, sbcs);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sbreadonaddr&lt;/code&gt; flag is critical: it converts the address write into an atomic read-trigger operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without &lt;code&gt;sbreadonaddr&lt;/code&gt;, a memory read requires three transactions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1. Write address to SBADDRESS0
2. Write SBCS with read trigger
3. Read data from SBDATA0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;sbreadonaddr=1&lt;/code&gt;, the middle step is eliminated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1. Write address to SBADDRESS0  ← Triggers bus read automatically
2. Read data from SBDATA0       ← Data is ready
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation (&lt;code&gt;rp2350.c:1013-1020&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dap_write_mem32(target, DM_SBADDRESS0, addr);  // Write triggers read
result = dap_read_mem32(target, DM_SBDATA0);   // Data is already valid&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debug Module's state machine looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;IDLE → [SBADDRESS0 written] → BUSY → [bus read completes] → DATA_READY
                                ↓
                           [bus timeout] → SBERROR=1
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory writes use SBDATA0 as the trigger register:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dap_write_mem32(target, DM_SBADDRESS0, addr);   // Set address
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_SBDATA0, value);     // Write triggers bus write&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The write to SBDATA0 initiates the system bus write transaction. The debugger should poll SBCS.sbbusyerror to detect completion (though in practice, pipelined writes are often used).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SBCS.sberror field reports transaction failures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;0: No error
1: Timeout (bus did not respond)
2: Bad address (unmapped region)
3: Bad alignment (misaligned access)
4: Bad size (unsupported width)
7: Other error
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Errors are sticky and must be explicitly cleared by writing 1 to SBCS.sberror (W1C = Write-1-to-Clear).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The library maintains comprehensive state tracking to avoid redundant SWD transactions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef struct {
    bool connected;
    uint32_t idcode;
    bool resource_registered;
    // ...
} swd_target_t;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef struct {
    uint8_t current_apsel;
    uint8_t current_bank;
    bool ctrlsel;
    uint32_t select_cache;
    bool powered;
    uint retry_count;
} dap_state_t;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RP2350 contains two RISC-V harts (hardware threads) that execute independently. The library maintains per-hart state to avoid redundant operations and enable concurrent debugging:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef struct {
    bool halt_state_known;  // false after resume, true after halt/read status
    bool halted;            // true if hart is currently halted

    // Register cache
    bool cache_valid;       // true if cached values are current
    uint32_t cached_pc;
    uint32_t cached_gprs[32];
    uint64_t cache_timestamp;  // For LRU if needed
} hart_state_t;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top-level RP2350 state maintains an array of hart states:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define RP2350_NUM_HARTS 2

typedef struct {
    bool initialized;
    bool sba_initialized;

    // Per-hart state
    hart_state_t harts[RP2350_NUM_HARTS];

    // Shared cache configuration
    bool cache_enabled;
} rp2350_state_t;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;halt_state_known&lt;/code&gt; flag implements a three-state model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unknown (&lt;code&gt;halt_state_known=false&lt;/code&gt;): Hart state is uncertain (after resume or initialization)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Known Halted (&lt;code&gt;halt_state_known=true, halted=true&lt;/code&gt;): Hart is confirmed halted&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Known Running (&lt;code&gt;halt_state_known=true, halted=false&lt;/code&gt;): Hart is confirmed running&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This prevents expensive DMSTATUS polls when the state is known. State transitions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;cache_enabled=true&lt;/code&gt;, the library caches register values after reads. This optimization benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repeated reads of the same register (e.g., polling loop variables)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bulk register dumps where &lt;code&gt;rp2350_read_all_regs()&lt;/code&gt;populates the cache&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduced SWD traffic (each register read requires ~6 SWD transactions)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cache invalidation occurs on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hart resume (execution changes registers)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Register write (specific register invalidated)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hart halt request (conservative invalidation)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cache is per-hart, allowing concurrent debugging of both harts without interference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PIO resources are scarce: RP2040/RP2350 provide 2 PIO blocks with 4 state machines each. The library implements a global resource tracker for multi-target support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef struct {
    swd_target_t *pio0_sm_owners[4];
    swd_target_t *pio1_sm_owners[4];
    uint active_count;
} resource_tracker_t;

extern resource_tracker_t g_resources;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;SWD_PIO_AUTO&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;SWD_SM_AUTO&lt;/code&gt; is specified in configuration, the library scans for free resources (&lt;code&gt;swd.c:105-125&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;swd_error_t allocate_pio_sm(PIO *pio, uint *sm) {
    for (uint i = 0; i &amp;lt; 4; i++) {
        if (g_resources.pio0_sm_owners[i] == NULL) {
            *pio = pio0;
            *sm = i;
            return SWD_OK;
        }
    }
    // Try PIO1...
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Up to 8 simultaneous target connections are supported (limited by hardware resources).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The library provides comprehensive error reporting through enumerated error codes and detailed message strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef enum {
    SWD_OK = 0,
    SWD_ERROR_TIMEOUT,        // Transaction timeout
    SWD_ERROR_FAULT,          // Target FAULT response
    SWD_ERROR_PROTOCOL,       // Malformed packet
    SWD_ERROR_PARITY,         // Parity check failure
    SWD_ERROR_WAIT,           // WAIT response retry exhausted
    SWD_ERROR_NOT_CONNECTED,  // No active connection
    SWD_ERROR_NOT_HALTED,     // Operation requires halted hart
    SWD_ERROR_ALREADY_HALTED, // Hart already halted (informational)
    // ...
} swd_error_t;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each target maintains a 128-byte error detail buffer for formatted diagnostic messages (&lt;code&gt;swd.c:67-84&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void swd_set_error(swd_target_t *target, swd_error_t error,
                   const char *detail, ...) {
    target-&amp;gt;last_error = error;
    va_list args;
    va_start(args, detail);
    vsnprintf(target-&amp;gt;error_detail, sizeof(target-&amp;gt;error_detail),
              detail, args);
    va_end(args);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SWD protocol ACK responses are mapped to error codes (&lt;code&gt;swd.c:91-99&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;swd_error_t swd_ack_to_error(uint8_t ack) {
    switch (ack) {
        case 0x1: return SWD_OK;            // OK
        case 0x2: return SWD_ERROR_WAIT;    // WAIT
        case 0x4: return SWD_ERROR_FAULT;   // FAULT
        default:  return SWD_ERROR_PROTOCOL;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WAIT responses trigger automatic retry with backoff (&lt;code&gt;swd_protocol.c:197-208&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for (uint retry = 0; retry &amp;lt; target-&amp;gt;dap.retry_count; retry++) {
    err = swd_io_raw(target, request, value, false);
    if (err != SWD_ERROR_WAIT) break;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Single-step execution enables instruction-level debugging by executing exactly one instruction before re-entering debug mode. This is implemented via the DCSR.step bit (Debug Control and Status Register, bit 2).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When DCSR.step=1, the hart executes one instruction after &lt;code&gt;resumereq&lt;/code&gt;, then immediately re-halts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Debug Mode → [resumereq + DCSR.step=1] → Execute 1 instruction → Debug Mode
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation (&lt;code&gt;rp2350.c:431-504&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1: Read current DCSR&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;swd_result_t dcsr_result = read_dcsr(target, hart_id);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DCSR must be read via PROGBUF (see Section 7.D) because it's a debug-only CSR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Set step bit&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t dcsr_stepped = dcsr_result.value | (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2);
write_dcsr(target, hart_id, dcsr_stepped);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 3: Resume hart&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t dmcontrol = make_dmcontrol(hart_id, false, true, false);
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_DMCONTROL, dmcontrol);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hart now executes exactly one instruction, then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PC is saved to DPC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hart re-enters debug mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DCSR.cause = 0x4 (single-step)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 4: Wait for automatic halt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;poll_dmstatus_halted(target, hart_id, true);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 5: Clear step bit&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;write_dcsr(target, hart_id, dcsr_result.value);  // Restore original DCSR&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ensures subsequent &lt;code&gt;rp2350_resume()&lt;/code&gt; calls don't single-step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The library implements software instruction tracing by repeatedly single-stepping and recording each instruction. This provides a "time-travel" debugging capability at the cost of execution speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tracing uses a callback function to process each instruction (&lt;code&gt;rp2350.c:1262-1337&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef struct {
    uint32_t pc;
    uint32_t instruction;
    uint32_t regs[32];  // Valid if capture_regs=true
} trace_record_t;

typedef bool (*trace_callback_t)(const trace_record_t *record, void *user_data);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The callback returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; to continue or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int rp2350_trace(swd_target_t *target, uint8_t hart_id,
                 uint32_t max_instructions,
                 trace_callback_t callback, void *user_data,
                 bool capture_regs);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each instruction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read PC (via PROGBUF): Current instruction address&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read memory at PC: Fetch the instruction word&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional: Read all GPRs: If &lt;code&gt;capture_regs=true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Invoke callback: User processes the record&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-step: Execute one instruction&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repeat until &lt;code&gt;max_instructions&lt;/code&gt;or callback returns false&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loop Detection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool detect_loop(const trace_record_t *record, void *user_data) {
    static uint32_t entry_pc = 0;
    static int count = 0;

    if (count == 0) entry_pc = record-&amp;gt;pc;
    if (record-&amp;gt;pc == entry_pc &amp;amp;&amp;amp; count &amp;gt; 0) {
        printf("Loop detected at PC=0x%08x\n", record-&amp;gt;pc);
        return false;  // Stop trace
    }
    count++;
    return true;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Register State History:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool capture_state(const trace_record_t *record, void *user_data) {
    printf("%08x: %08x  x5=%08x x6=%08x\n",
           record-&amp;gt;pc, record-&amp;gt;instruction,
           record-&amp;gt;regs[5], record-&amp;gt;regs[6]);
    return true;
}

rp2350_trace(target, 0, 100, capture_state, NULL, true);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Speed: ~5ms per instruction (200 instructions/second)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interrupt Masking: Tracing should occur with interrupts disabled (clear mstatus.MIE)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory Consistency: Instructions are fetched via SBA; ensure I-cache coherency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No Hardware Triggers: Trace starts immediately; no "trace until condition"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hart reset (&lt;code&gt;rp2350_reset&lt;/code&gt;) implements a controlled reset sequence via DMCONTROL.ndmreset (non-debug module reset, bit 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;swd_error_t rp2350_reset(swd_target_t *target, uint8_t hart_id,
                         bool halt_on_reset);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1: Assert ndmreset&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint32_t dmcontrol = make_dmcontrol(hart_id, halt_on_reset, false, true);
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_DMCONTROL, dmcontrol);
sleep_ms(10);  // Hold reset&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Deassert ndmreset&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dmcontrol = make_dmcontrol(hart_id, halt_on_reset, false, false);
dap_write_mem32(target, DM_DMCONTROL, dmcontrol);
sleep_ms(50);  // Wait for reset completion&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;halt_on_reset=true&lt;/code&gt;, the DMCONTROL.haltreq bit remains set, causing the hart to enter debug mode immediately after reset, with PC set to the reset vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reset is equivalent to a power-on reset for the hart:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PC → reset vector (typically 0x00000000 for RP2350 RISC-V cores)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All CSRs → architectural reset values&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPRs → undefined&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cache → invalidated&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike a full chip reset, peripherals and other harts are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RP2350's two RISC-V harts (Hazard3 cores) are symmetric and independently controllable. The library provides full per-hart state tracking and concurrent operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each Debug Module operation targets a specific hart via DMCONTROL.hartsel[9:0]:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static inline uint32_t make_dmcontrol(uint8_t hart_id, bool haltreq,
                                       bool resumereq, bool ndmreset) {
    uint32_t dmcontrol = (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0);  // dmactive = 1
    dmcontrol |= ((uint32_t)hart_id &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 16);  // hartsello[9:0] at bits 25:16
    if (haltreq) dmcontrol |= (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 31);
    if (resumereq) dmcontrol |= (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 30);
    if (ndmreset) dmcontrol |= (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1);
    return dmcontrol;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before any hart-specific operation (halt, resume, register read), the library writes DMCONTROL with the correct &lt;code&gt;hart_id&lt;/code&gt;, switching the Debug Module's attention to that hart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test suite validates that harts operate independently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Halt hart 0, keep hart 1 running
rp2350_halt(target, 0);
rp2350_resume(target, 1);

// Read hart 0 registers while hart 1 executes
uint32_t h0_regs[32];
rp2350_read_all_regs(target, 0, h0_regs);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This enables debugging one hart while the other maintains real-time operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each hart maintains independent register state. Writing x5 on hart 0 does not affect x5 on hart 1. This is validated by &lt;code&gt;test_dual_hart.c:69-115&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;rp2350_write_reg(target, 0, 5, 0xAAAAAAAA);
rp2350_write_reg(target, 1, 5, 0x55555555);

assert(rp2350_read_reg(target, 0, 5).value == 0xAAAAAAAA);
assert(rp2350_read_reg(target, 1, 5).value == 0x55555555);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both harts share the same physical memory space but maintain independent caches. This creates coherency considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SBA Writes: Visible to both harts (after cache invalidation)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hart 0 Writes: Not immediately visible to Hart 1 if cached&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Explicit Synchronization: Required for inter-hart communication&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test suite exercises memory access while both harts run concurrently (&lt;code&gt;test_mem.c:291-347&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This implementation does not currently support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RISC-V Debug Specification defines a Trigger Module for hardware breakpoints. Implementation was removed due to complexity. Workaround: Use single-step + PC comparison in software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SWD protocol supports multiple targets on one bus via unique addresses. This library assumes a single target. Physical wiring for multi-target is possible but requires additional multiplexing logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RP2350's Hazard3 cores support the C extension (16-bit compressed instructions). The library:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Correctly reads compressed instructions during tracing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Does NOT decode compressed instruction mnemonics&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assumes 4-byte alignment for code upload&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No cycle-accurate performance counters are exposed. Implementing this requires:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access to mcycle/minstret CSRs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Periodic sampling without halting (not possible with current SBA coherency)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No routines for RP2350 flash programming. This requires:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Loading flash programmer stub to SRAM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Executing stub via &lt;code&gt;rp2350_execute_code()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monitoring completion via polling&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The architecture supports this; implementation is left to applications.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I posted about how much fun I was having with the Fomu FPGA development board while travelling. This project from Tim ‘mithro’ Ansell and Sean ‘xobs’ Cross is not new, but remains a favorite of mine because of how portable it is — the entire board can fit in your USB port!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fomu includes a Lattice Semiconductor iCE40 UltraPlus 5K, which has been a popular FPGA option over the past few years due to the reverse engineered bitstream format and ability to program it with a fully open source toolchain (see updated repository here). One of the more recent production uses I have heard about is in the Oxide Computer, which I discussed with Nathanael Huffman on an episode of Microarch Club and has also come up on the Oxide &amp;amp; Friends podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting attributes of the Fomu is that, despite the fact that it is programmed over USB, it doesn’t actually include any USB peripheral hardware. Instead, in order to make the board small enough to fit in the USB port, the USB core is implemented in RTL (Fomu uses ValentyUSB) and is included in the Foboot bootloader. Most FPGAs support writing bitstreams directly into SRAM, meaning that it will have to be reprogrammed after a power cycle, or storing a bistream in a separate flash IC that the FPGA will read from when powered on. iCE40 FPGAs are no different, but also include a Non-Volatile Configuration Memory (NVCM), which allows for one-time programming of a bitstream in high-volume applications. From the iCE40 Programming and Configuration Technical Note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;iCE40 components are configured for a specific application by loading a binary configuration bitstream image, generated by the Lattice development system. For high-volume applications, the bitstream image is usually permanently programmed in the on-chip Non-volatile Configuration Memory. However, the bitstream image can also be stored externally in a standard, low-cost commodity SPI serial Flash PROM. The iCE40 component can automatically load the image using the SPI Master Configuration Interface. Similarly, the iCE40 configuration data can be downloaded from an external processor, microcontroller, or DSP using an SPI-like serial interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that the Fomu is primarily intended for prototyping and education, utilizing the NVCM is unnecessary. However, it does include a GD25Q16CEIGR flash chip for persistent bitstream storage. Despite the Fomu hardware also being open source, I hadn’t spent much time looking at the schematic when developing with it in the past. However, while on the plane ride back from my travels, I was reading some of the documentation for the device and became curious about how the device supported both loading bitstreams into SRAM on the iCE40 and into the external flash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other FPGA development boards, such as the Arty A7 I have previously written about, support configuring the FPGA’s SRAM by including a USB to Serial IC (the Arty A7 uses the FTDI FT2232HQ) that can be used to configure the FPGA directly, or configure the FPGA with a bitstream that allows it to talk to the SPI flash, which is subsequently used to store the user bitstream in flash. From the Arty A7 reference manual:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When programming a nonvolatile flash device, a bitstream file is transferred to the flash in a two-step process. First, the FPGA is programmed with a circuit that can program flash devices, and then data is transferred to the flash device via the FPGA circuit (this complexity is hidden from the user by the Xilinx tools). This is called indirect programming. After the flash device has been programmed, it can automatically configure the FPGA at a subsequent power-on or reset event as determined by the mode jumper setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, as previously mentioned, the Fomu’s USB core is implemented in RTL, which presents a few challenges. Namely, the FPGA needs to be “bootstrapped” — we cannot configure the FPGA or the SPI flash via USB without the USB core already running on the FPGA. Fomu uses a bootloader, Foboot, which includes gateware for a RISC-V core (VexRiscv) and various peripherals, as well as software for USB and DFU suppport. If you buy a Fomu, Foboot will already be present on the device. You can update Foboot using the Booster program, but if you somehow perform a faulty update, you could find yourself with a bricked device that cannot be accesed over USB. In that case, you’ll need to be able to access the components by some other means. Or, if you’re like me, you might just be interested in loading alternative gateware and software onto the device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fomu hardware repository has a nice image with some of the board’s test points labeled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing that I noticed was that there was only one “chip select” (&lt;code&gt;SPI_CS&lt;/code&gt;) test point. Both the FPGA and the flash IC can act as SPI
peripherals, and typically a &lt;code&gt;CS&lt;/code&gt; line is required from the controller to each
peripheral in a multidrop configuration, or peripherals can be
daisy-chained
if supported. The iCE40 is particularly interesting in this scenario because, as
previously mentioned, it can act as a controller when reading from the flash IC,
or as a peripheral when being configured directly. When supplying power, the
iCE40 will act as a SPI controller by default and attempt to load a bistream
from the flash IC. If we want to program the flash directly via the test points,
then we need to keep the iCE40 from attempting to control it. This is possible
because the &lt;code&gt;CRESET&lt;/code&gt; pin is also available on a test point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As shown in the technical note, driving &lt;code&gt;CRESET&lt;/code&gt; low will reset the device, and
configuration will not begin until the next rising edge. At this point it is
clear how we can go about programming the flash IC: hold the iCE40 in reset
while we program the flash using the exposed SPI test points. One plausible
assumption is that only the flash IC can be accessed over SPI via the test
points. In fact, we really don’t need direct access to the iCE40 because if the
flash IC can be programmed, then the iCE40 will load the persistent bitstream
when powered on, and a bricked device could be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the iCEstick evaluation board made by Lattice Semiconductor, which uses an FTDI FT2232H in similar fashion to the Arty A7, takes this to heart. In the user guide, it states the following under “Known Issue”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This board is designed for SPI flash programming only. This would prevent the iCE device from being accidentally NVCM programmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This is also called out in the help output for &lt;code&gt;iceprog&lt;/code&gt;,
a programming tool included in Project IceStorm.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you would expect, this is reflected in the schematic from the same document. The SPI chip select pins on the iCE40 and the flash IC have a pull-up resistor, and the &lt;code&gt;iCE_SS_B&lt;/code&gt; net allows for pulling the &lt;code&gt;CS&lt;/code&gt; pin on the flash IC low for
programming, while the iCE40 &lt;code&gt;SPI_SS_B&lt;/code&gt; pin drives it after boot when the FPGA
is acting as the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, as you may have noticed in the first image in this post, the note on the Fomu schematic indicates that both the iCE40 and the flash IC can be programmed via the test points. This complicates things a bit because, up until now, each component only ever plays a single role:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The iCE40 FPGA is always a SPI controller.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The programmer (e.g. the machine connected to the test points) is always a SPI controller.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The flash IC is always a SPI peripheral, either accessed by the programmer or the FPGA.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we are configuring the iCE40 directly, the iCE40 now needs to act as a peripheral, and the flash IC needs to no longer be driven by traffic on the SPI nets. Though not labeled in the device image, opening the design in the KiCad PCB viewer reveals the placement of the &lt;code&gt;SPI_IO2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SPI_IO3&lt;/code&gt; (as well as the
&lt;code&gt;CDONE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;USB_P&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;USB_N&lt;/code&gt;) test points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SPI_IO3&lt;/code&gt; is connected to the flash IC &lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; pin. This is in contrast to the
iCEstick, where the flash IC’s &lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; pin has a pull-up resistor (i.e. the
active low pin is never asserted). Because we have access to the &lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; pin on
the Fomu, we can drive it low to have the flash IC ignore all SPI traffic while
configuring the iCE40 directly. We also need to swap the pins used for the MOSI
and MISO signals, as &lt;code&gt;SPI_MOSI&lt;/code&gt; is connected to the iCE40’s &lt;code&gt;SPI_SO&lt;/code&gt; pin, and
&lt;code&gt;SPI_MISO&lt;/code&gt; is connected to &lt;code&gt;SPI_SI&lt;/code&gt;. When I looked at
&lt;code&gt;fomu-flash&lt;/code&gt;, a utility to program Fomu
boards using a Raspberry Pi, it appeared as though that was exactly what was
happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;        spiHold(spi);
        spiSwapTxRx(spi);
        fpgaResetSlave(fpga);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, upon further inspection, &lt;code&gt;spiHold()&lt;/code&gt; is not actually asserting the
&lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; pin, but rather issuing a
command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void spiHold(struct ff_spi *spi) {
	spiBegin(spi);
	spiCommand(spi, 0xb9);
	spiEnd(spi);
}
void spiUnhold(struct ff_spi *spi) {
	spiBegin(spi);
	spiCommand(spi, 0xab);
	spiEnd(spi);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In looking up the &lt;code&gt;spiHold()&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;spiUnhold()&lt;/code&gt; commands in the GD25Q16CEIGR
datasheet,
I observed that they correspond to “Deep Power-Down (DP)” (&lt;code&gt;0xb9&lt;/code&gt;) and “Release
from Deep Power-Down and Read Device ID (RDI)” (&lt;code&gt;0xab&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Executing the Deep Power-Down (DP) command is the only way to put the device in the lowest consumption mode (the Deep Power-Down Mode). It can also be used as an extra software protection mechanism, while the device is not in active use, since in this mode, the device ignores all Write, Program and Erase commands… Once the device has entered the Deep Power-Down Mode, all commands are ignored except the Release from Deep Power-Down and Read Device ID (RDI) command. These commands can release the device from this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why using the power down strategy rather than asserting &lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; may be useful. First, the GD25Q16CEIGR supports Dual and Quad SPI, and in
the latter case the &lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; pin is reassigned as the final I/O pin (&lt;code&gt;IO3&lt;/code&gt;). If
the goal is to configure the iCE40 directly, this may not be too much of a
problem, but the Quad Enable (QE) bit is set in a non-volatile status register,
so a previous interaction with the device where it was set could cause the
&lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; strategy to fail (with the Fomu specifically, I suspect that would also
cause issues any time the iCE40 attempted to control the flash IC). Perhaps a
more likely motivator is that it reduces the number of test points that need to
be accessed to configure the iCE40 directly. Only the 7 labeled in the initial
image (&lt;code&gt;5V&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;GND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CRESET&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SPI_MOSI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SPI_MISO&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SPI_CLK&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SPI_CS&lt;/code&gt;) are
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FPGAs are fascinating on many dimensions, but one of the most interesting is how they are configured. As we can see with the Fomu and other iCE40 based platforms, the capabilities of the FPGA can lead to some interesting board design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Head in the Zed Cloud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past five months I've been leading the efforts to rebuild Zed's cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our current backend—known as Collab—has been chugging along since basically the beginning of the company. We use Collab every day to work together on Zed in Zed. However, as Zed continues to grow and attracts more users, we knew that we needed a full reboot of our backend infrastructure to set us up for success for our future endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter Zed Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Zed itself, Zed Cloud is built in Rust1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time around there is a slight twist: all of this is running on Cloudflare Workers, with our Rust code being compiled down to WebAssembly (Wasm).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Cloudflare Workers?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of our goals with this rebuild was to reduce the amount of operational effort it takes to maintain our hosted services, so that we can focus more of our time and energy on building Zed itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Workers allow us to easily scale up to meet demand without having to fuss over it too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Cloudflare offers an ever-growing amount of managed services that cover anything you might need for a production web service. Here are some of the Cloudflare services we're using today:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hyperdrive for talking to Postgres&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Workers KV for ephemeral storage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cloudflare Queues for asynchronous job processing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Platform&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another one of our goals with this rebuild was to build a platform that was easy to test. To achieve this, we built our own platform framework on top of the Cloudflare Workers runtime APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the heart of this framework is the &lt;code&gt;Platform&lt;/code&gt; trait:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub trait Platform: Sized + Clone + 'static {
    type Cache: cache::Cache;
    type Clock: Clock;
    type KvStore: KvStore&amp;lt;Self&amp;gt;;
    type ServiceBinding: Fetcher&amp;lt;Self&amp;gt;;
    type DurableObjectNamespace: durable_object::DurableObjectNamespace&amp;lt;Self&amp;gt;;
    type DurableObjectStub: durable_object::DurableObjectStub&amp;lt;Self&amp;gt;;
    type DurableObjectState: durable_object::DurableObjectState&amp;lt;Self&amp;gt;;
    type RateLimiter: rate_limiter::RateLimiter&amp;lt;Self&amp;gt;;
    type SqlStorage: sql::SqlStorage;
    type PostgresConnection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;: postgres::PostgresConnection&amp;lt;Self, T&amp;gt;;
    type PostgresTransaction&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;: postgres::PostgresTransaction&amp;lt;Self, T&amp;gt;;
    type ExecutionContext: ExecutionContext + Clone + Unpin;
    type Environment: Environment&amp;lt;Self&amp;gt; + Clone + Unpin;
    type ClientWebSocket: websocket::ClientWebSocket;
    type ServerWebSocket: websocket::ServerWebSocket&amp;lt;Self&amp;gt;;
    type WebSocketReceiver: websocket::WebSocketReceiver;
    type WebSocketSender: websocket::WebSocketSender;
    type HttpClient: http_client::HttpClient&amp;lt;Platform = Self&amp;gt;;
    type Queue&amp;lt;T: Serialize + 'static&amp;gt;: queue::Queue&amp;lt;Self, T&amp;gt;;
    type RawQueueMessageBatch: queue::RawQueueMessageBatch&amp;lt;Self&amp;gt;;
    type QueueMessageBatch&amp;lt;T: DeserializeOwned + 'static&amp;gt;: queue::QueueMessageBatch&amp;lt;Self, T&amp;gt;;
    type QueueMessage&amp;lt;T: DeserializeOwned + 'static&amp;gt;: queue::QueueMessage&amp;lt;Self, T&amp;gt;;
    type Rng: Clone + RngCore;

    fn websocket_pair() -&amp;gt; Result&amp;lt;(Self::ClientWebSocket, Self::ServerWebSocket)&amp;gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This trait allows us to write our code in a platform-agnostic way while still leveraging all of the functionality that Cloudflare Workers has to offer. Each one of these associated types corresponds to some aspect of the platform that we'll want to have control over in a test environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, if we have a service that needs to interact with the system clock and a Workers KV store, we would define it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub struct BillingService&amp;lt;P: Platform&amp;gt; {
    clock: P::Clock,
    kv_store: P::KvStore,
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Two platforms, both alike in dignity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two implementors of the &lt;code&gt;Platform&lt;/code&gt; trait: &lt;code&gt;CloudflarePlatform&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SimulatedPlatform&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;CloudflarePlatform&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CloudflarePlatform&lt;/code&gt;—as the name might suggest—is an implementation of the platform on top of the Cloudflare Workers runtime. This implementation targets Wasm and is what we run when developing locally (using Wrangler) and in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a &lt;code&gt;cloudflare_bindings&lt;/code&gt; crate2 that contains &lt;code&gt;wasm_bindgen&lt;/code&gt; bindings to the Cloudflare Workers JS runtime. You can think of &lt;code&gt;CloudflarePlatform&lt;/code&gt; as the glue between those bindings and the idiomatic Rust APIs exposed by the &lt;code&gt;Platform&lt;/code&gt; trait.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;SimulatedPlatform&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;SimulatedPlatform&lt;/code&gt; is used when running tests, and allows for simulating almost every part of the system in order to effectively test our code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's an example of a test for ingesting a webhook from Orb:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[test]
fn test_orb_webhook_ingestion() {
    Simulator::once(|simulator| async move {
        let test_ctx = OrbWebhooksTestContext::init(&amp;amp;simulator).await?;

        // Some more test setup...

        let request = make_orb_webhook_request(
            HANDLE_ORB_WEBHOOK_URL,
            &amp;amp;webhook_event,
            "2025-09-10T18:16:06.483Z".parse().unwrap(),
            &amp;amp;test_ctx.config.orb_webhook_signing_secret,
        )?;

        let response = test_ctx.worker.fetch(request).await?;
        assert_eq!(response.status, StatusCode::OK);

        simulator.scheduler.run()?;

        let updated_billing_subscription = BillingSubscriptionRepository
            .find(&amp;amp;test_ctx.app_database, billing_subscription.id)
            .await?;
        assert_eq!(
            updated_billing_subscription.kind,
            Some(app_database::SubscriptionKind::TokenBasedZedPro)
        );
        assert_eq!(
            updated_billing_subscription.orb_subscription_status,
            Some(app_database::OrbSubscriptionStatus::Active)
        );
    })
    .unwrap();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this test we're able to test the full end-to-end flow of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Receiving and validating an incoming webhook event to our webhook ingestion endpoint&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Putting the webhook event into a queue&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consuming the webhook event in a background worker and processing it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The call to &lt;code&gt;simulator.scheduler.run()?&lt;/code&gt; advances the test simulator, in this case running the pending queue consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the center of the &lt;code&gt;SimulatedPlatform&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;code&gt;scheduler&lt;/code&gt;, a crate that powers our in-house async runtime. The scheduler is shared between GPUI—Zed's UI framework—and the &lt;code&gt;Simulator&lt;/code&gt; used in tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shared scheduler enables us to write tests that span the client and the server. So we can have a test that starts in a piece of Zed code, flows through Zed Cloud, and then asserts on the state of something in Zed after it receives the response from the backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where we're headed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The work being done on Zed Cloud now is laying the foundation to support our future work around collaborative coding with DeltaDB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to work with me on building out Zed Cloud, we are currently hiring for this role.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're looking for engineers with experience building and maintaining web APIs and platforms, solid web fundamentals, and who are excited about Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you end up applying, you can mention this blog post in your application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The codebase is currently 70k lines of Rust code and 5.7k lines of TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is essentially our own version of &lt;code&gt;worker-sys&lt;/code&gt;. I'd like to switch to using &lt;code&gt;worker-sys&lt;/code&gt; directly, at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45876308</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:23:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Time to start de-Appling</title><link>https://heatherburns.tech/2025/11/10/time-to-start-de-appling/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="b049d1f1222217d5"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‘ve done such a thorough job of de-Googling that I forgot to show up for a meeting with someone, because I hadn’t checked my Google calendar in ages. (No, they were not amused.) In my defense, I proceeded to explain to them that having de-Googled, I was also in the process of de-Appling, which is a special bonus level that those of us in the UK have unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this in the sunlit uplands, you need to start that too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to start that because, as we recently learned, at some point in the very near future Apple is withdrawing its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature from the UK altogether as a result of the Home Office TCN through the Investigatory Powers Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users who already had ADP enabled when the first TCN became public in February will be required to manually switch it off or lose their iCloud account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not going to explain the chapter and verse of the legal saga today, because I prefer to do that for people who pay me to explain them the chapter and verse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I will say that the shutdown of ADP is Apple being on the right side of the geopolitical fight, as inconvenient as that may be to you and me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the whole debacle blew up in February, Apple announced that ADP would no longer be available for new users, but would remain unaffected for those of us who already had it activated. That assurance was nothing to sleep on, and so we have been waiting for the inevitable. Apple’s September update confirmed that its days are numbered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what does that mean for you? Again, from their September update:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our communication services, like iMessage and FaceTime, remain end-to-end encrypted globally, including in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users in the UK who have not already enabled Advanced Data Protection will no longer have the option to do so. That means the 10 iCloud data categories covered by ADP will be protected by Standard Data Protection, and UK users will not have a choice to benefit from end-to-end encryption for these categories: iCloud Backup; iCloud Drive; Photos; Notes; Reminders; Safari Bookmarks; Siri Shortcuts; Voice Memos; Wallet Passes; and Freeform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that if you already had ADP activated, and e2ee is critical to your personal or operational security, you need to get everything in that list – iCloud Backup, iCloud Drive, Photos, Notes, Reminders, Safari Bookmarks, Siri Shortcuts, Voice Memos, Wallet Passes, and Freeform – off of iCloud sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done that, go into your iCloud settings, click on Manage, then click on each thing individually to purge it off iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not going to tell you where to move your stuff other than to say that if you’re moving it from one big tech company to another, you’re just being daft. Likewise, if you’re moving your stuff to a non-e2ee service, don’t bother. If you need an e2ee service try Proton. They have a Black Friday sale on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of Notes, first download the Exporter app from the app store. It does what it says on the tin. You’ll end up with a folder full of markdown files which you can upload elsewhere. E2EE being the dealbreaker, I chose Standard Notes. I know a lot of folk who prefer Obsidian or Joplin. Whatever you choose, do not use a non-E2EE note service.*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know as well as I do that you need to be moving everything you can out of the American stack anyway so just stick this task on your to-do list, which should not be Reminders, and get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What about the non-e2ee stuff in iCloud?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full list of what lives in iCloud and how it is or is not encrypted is here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know from the tiny bits of the TCN saga which have been publicly disclosed, thanks to the only two media outlets that are bothering to cover it, that the first TCN was not just for the end-to-end encrypted data protected by ADP. It was for anything on iCloud, full stop, worldwide:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…however, the new IPT filing states the TCN “is not limited to” data stored under ADP, suggesting the UK government sought bulk interception access to Apple’s standard iCloud service, which is much more widely used by the company’s customers. The TCN also included “obligations to provide and maintain a capability to disclose categories of data stored within a cloud-based backup service”, the filing states, which suggests the government sought to tap messages or passwords that were backed up in the cloud as well. “The obligations included in the TCN are not limited to the UK or users of the service in the UK; they apply globally in respect of the relevant data categories of all iCloud users,” the IPT filing adds. Tim Bradshaw and Anna Gross at the Financial Times (£)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that you have some serious thinking to do about what you intend to trust to the Apple stack altogether going forward, even things like passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you what to do but once again, you have options. Educate yourself. Consider the opsec and persec needs not just of yourself, but for the people around you who could be adversely affected by insecure data going walkies out of your account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What if I’m not in the UK?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This impacts the UK only: as their September update noted, Advanced Data Protection continues to be available everywhere else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It does mean that if you have someone in the UK on your team, you need to factor them in as part of your threat model. We are all liabilities to our own opsec now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re not in the UK, and you don’t have ADP activated, take 10 seconds to do it right now, you lucky sod.&lt;lb/&gt; Settings &amp;gt; Your name Apple Account &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Advanced Data Protection&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What about that second TCN?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 1st of October, the Home Office issued a second TCN against Apple for the same as before, but only for British citizens’ data. World-leading!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those who follow my work know that this phrase made me spew a double barrel of Glaswegian swearing. British citizens’ data, as opposed to British users’ data? The dividing line here is not e.g. being located in the UK or having registered an account here, but what it says on your passport? How is Apple going to know that, much less roll it out? (/s)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did Apple just publicly state that they’re going to be removing a security layer and adding a nationality check layer?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t know because as with the first TCN, that information only became available in the public domain due to someone leaking it to the media. That’s all there is to know. Everything else is confidential and NCND. There is nothing else to say because nothing else is known. If someone who did know something was sitting across from me right now, and they told me, they would be committing a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those of us who care about these things enough to show up in difficult places are keeping tabs on both TCNs, and the wider legal and technical implications of both, as best we possibly can. Don’t expect to hear anything more until January, when the Liberty/PI challenge on the first TCN goes to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. In the interim, if you want me to bore you about ECHR case law and how the UK’s review into Article 8 seems a little too coincidentally timed, pick a pub.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his 1933 essay “The Triumph of Stupidity,” Bertrand Russell remarked that “the problem with the world is that the stupid are cocksure, while the intelligent are full of doubt.” This is something I often think about when ChatGPT hits me up with another “that’s a fantastic idea” when the idea is clearly anything but great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How often do you think a ChatGPT user walks away not just misinformed, but misinformed with conviction? I would bet this happens all the time. And I can’t help but wonder what the effects are in the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can relate to this on a personal level: As I ChatGPT user I notice that I’m often left with a sense of certainty. After discussing an issue with an LLM I feel like I know something — a lot, perhaps — but more often than not this information is either slightly incorrect or completely wrong. And you know what? I can’t help it. Even when I acknowledge this illusion, I can’t help chasing the wonderful feeling of conviction these models give. It’s great to feel like you know almost everything. Of course I come back for more. And it’s just not the feeling; I would be dishonest to claim these models wouldn’t have huge utility. Yet I’m a little worried about the psychological dimension of this whole ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They say AI is a mirror. This summarizes my experience. I feel LLMs “amplify” thinking. These models make your thoughts reverberate by taking them to multiple new directions. And sometimes these directions are really interesting. The thing is, though, that this goes both ways: A short ChatGPT session may help improve a good idea to a great idea. On the other hand, LLMs are amazing at supercharging self-delusion. These models will happily equip misguided thinking with a fluent, authoritative voice, which, in turn, sets up a psychological trap by delivering nonsense in a nice package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it’s so insanely habit-forming! I almost instinctively do a little back and forth with an LLM when I want to work on an idea. It hasn’t even been that long (these models have been around for, what, three years?) and I’m so used to them that I feel naked without. It’s getting even comical sometimes. When I lost my bag the other day and was going through the apartment looking for it, my first response to my growing frustration was that “I should ask ChatGPT where it is”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like LLMs are a fairly boring technology. They are stochastic black boxes. The training is essentially run-of-the-mill statistical inference. There are some more recent innovations on software/hardware-level, but these are not LLM-specific really. Is it too sardonic to say that the real “innovation” was throwing enough money at the problem to train the models at a huge scale? Maybe RLHF was a real innovation; I’m not sure. However, I don’t really feel like there is a lot to be interested in there. And yet, the current AI boom is extraordinarily interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the impact. The very real effect of all this in our lives. In hindsight, this will probably be one of the major shifts, and it will be reflected upon in terms of education, work and even society at large. Language cuts to the core of what and who we are. Speech is so natural to us that we even think in speech. And when a machine credibly stepped into that territory, something changed. I’m not sure what it is — I don’t think anyone really knows at this point — but I think there is a sense of shifting tides. I think it’s something most of us are trying to make sense of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think LLMs should not be seen as knowledge engines but as confidence engines. That, I feel, would better illustrate the potential near and medium-term futures we are dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;RYANAIR ISSUES REMINDER TO PASSENGERS AHEAD OF MOVE TO 100% DIGITAL BOARDING PASSES FROM WEDNESDAY (12 NOV)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ryanair, Europe’s No.1 airline, today (Thurs, 6 Nov) reminded passengers that from Wed (12 Nov) it will move to 100% digital boarding passes. This means that from Wed (12 Nov) passengers will no longer be able to download and print a physical paper boarding pass but will instead need to use the digital boarding pass generated in their “myRyanair” app during check-in to board their Ryanair flight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This transition, already adopted by nearly 80% of Ryanair’s 207M+ annual passengers, will deliver a faster, smarter, and greener travel experience. It will also give passengers easier access to a range of innovative in-app features, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Order to Seat: Order food and drinks from your phone and get served first.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Live Flight Information: Real-time status updates on boarding, gates, and delays.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct Updates: Instant notifications from Ryanair’s operations centre during disruption.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alternative Flight Options: Real-time alternative flight options during disruption.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Travel Documents: accessible in one convenient place.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ryanair CMO, Dara Brady, said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are now just a little less than a week out from our move to 100% digital boarding passes, meaning that from Wednesday, 12 November, passengers will no longer be able to download and print a physical paper boarding pass but will instead need to use the digital boarding pass generated in their “myRyanair” app during check-in to board their Ryanair flight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While over 80% of passengers already use digital boarding passes, and therefore won’t be affected by this progressive change, we remind the small number of passengers who still print boarding passes to download the myRyanair app ahead of the move to 100% digital boarding passes from Wednesday, 12 November.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving fully digital means a faster, smarter, and greener experience for passengers, whilst also providing easier access to a range of innovative in-app features, including ‘Order to Seat’, live flight information and direct updates during disruption. We look forward to delivering an enhanced travel experience for 100% of our customers, streamlined through our best-in-class myRyanair app.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can the cops get your online data? In short, yes. There are a variety of US federal and state laws which give law enforcement powers to obtain information that you provided to online services. But, there are steps you as a user and/or as a service provider can take to improve online privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Law enforcement demanding access to your private online data goes back to the beginning of the internet. In fact, one of EFF’s first cases, Steve Jackson Games v. Secret Service, exemplified the now all-too-familiar story where unfounded claims about illegal behavior resulted in overbroad seizures of user messages. But it’s not the ’90s anymore, the internet has become an integral part of everyone’s life. Everyone now relies on organizations big and small to steward our data, from huge service providers like Google, Meta, or your ISP, to hobbyists hosting a blog or Mastodon server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no “cloud,” just someone else's computer—and when the cops come knocking on their door, these hosts need to be willing to stand up for privacy, and know how to do so to the fullest extent under the law. These legal limits are also important for users to know, not only to mitigate risks in their security plan when choosing where to share data, but to understand whether these hosts are going to bat for them. Taking action together, service hosts and users can curb law enforcement getting more data than they’re allowed, protecting not just themselves but targeted populations, present and future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is distinct from law enforcement’s methods of collecting public data, such as the information now being collected on student visa applicants. Cops may use social media monitoring tools and sock puppet accounts to collect what you share publicly, or even within “private” communities. Police may also obtain the contents of communication in other ways that do not require court authorization, such as monitoring network traffic passively to catch metadata and possibly using advanced tools to partially reveal encrypted information. They can even outright buy information from online data brokers. Unfortunately there are few restrictions or oversight for these practices—something EFF is fighting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below however is a general breakdown of the legal processes used by US law enforcement for accessing private data, and what categories of private data these processes can disclose. Because this is a generalized summary, it is neither exhaustive nor should be considered legal advice. Please seek legal help if you have specific data privacy and security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Types of Data that Can be Collected&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The laws protecting private data online generally follow a pattern: the more sensitive the personal data is, the greater factual and legal burden police have to meet before they can obtain it. Although this is not exhaustive, here are a few categories of data you may be sharing with services, and why police might want to obtain it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Subscriber Data: Information you provide in order to use the service. Think about ID or payment information, IP address location, email, phone number, and other information you provided when signing up. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Law enforcement can learn who controls an anonymous account, and find other service providers to gather information from.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-content data, or "metadata": This is saved information about your interactions on the service; like when you used the service, for how long, and with whom. Analogous to what a postal worker can infer from a sealed letter with addressing information.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Law enforcement can use this information to infer a social graph, login history, and other information about a suspect’s behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stored content: This is the actual content you are sending and receiving, like your direct message history or saved drafts. This can cover any private information your service provider can access.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This most sensitive data is collected to reveal criminal evidence. Overly broad requests also allow for retroactive searches, information on other users, and can take information out of its original context.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Content in transit: This is the content of your communications as it is being communicated. This real-time access may also collect info which isn’t typically stored by a provider, like your voice during a phone call.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Law enforcement can compel providers to wiretap their own services for a particular user—which may also implicate the privacy of users they interact with.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Legal Processes Used to Get Your Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When US law enforcement has identified a service that likely has this data, they have a few tools to legally compel that service to hand it over and prevent users from knowing information is being collected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Subpoena&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subpoenas are demands from a prosecutor, law enforcement, or a grand jury which do not require approval of a judge before being sent to a service. The only restriction is this demand be relevant to an investigation. Often the only time a court reviews a subpoena is when a service or user challenges it in court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of direct court oversight in most cases, subpoenas are prone to abuse and overreach. Providers should scrutinize such requests carefully with a lawyer and push back before disclosure, particularly when law enforcement tries to use subpoenas to obtain more private data, such as the contents of communications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Court Order&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a similar demand to subpoenas, but usually pertains to a specific statute which requires a court to authorize the demand. Under the Stored Communications Act, for example, a court can issue an order for non-content information if police provide specific facts that the information being sought is relevant to an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like subpoenas, providers can usually challenge court orders before disclosure and inform the user(s) of the request, subject to law enforcement obtaining a gag order (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Search Warrant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A warrant is a demand issued by a judge to permit police to search specific places or persons. To obtain a warrant, police must submit an affidavit (a written statement made under oath) establishing that there is a fair probability (or “probable cause”) that evidence of a crime will be found at a particular place or on a particular person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically services cannot challenge a warrant before disclosure, as these requests are already approved by a magistrate. Sometimes police request that judges also enter gag orders against the target of the warrant that prevent hosts from informing the public or the user that the warrant exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Super Warrant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Police seeking to intercept communications as they occur generally face the highest legal burden. Usually the affidavit needs to not only establish probable cause, but also make clear that other investigation methods are not viable (exhaustion) and that the collection avoids capturing irrelevant data (minimization).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some laws also require high-level approval within law enforcement, such as leadership, to approve the request. Some laws also limit the types of crimes that law enforcement may use wiretaps in while they are investigating. The laws may also require law enforcement to periodically report back to the court about the wiretap, including whether they are minimizing collection of non-relevant communications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally these demands cannot be challenged while wiretapping is occurring, and providers are prohibited from telling the targets about the wiretap. But some laws require disclosure to targets and those who were communicating with them after the wiretap has ended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Gag orders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the legal authorities described above also permit law enforcement to simultaneously prohibit the service from telling the target of the legal process or the general public that the surveillance is occurring. These non-disclosure orders are prone to abuse and EFF has repeatedly fought them because they violate the First Amendment and prohibit public understanding about the breadth of law enforcement surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Services Can (and Should) Protect You&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This process isn't always clean-cut, and service providers must ultimately comply with lawful demands for user’s data, even when they challenge them and courts uphold the government’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Service providers outside the US also aren’t totally in the clear, as they must often comply with US law enforcement demands. This is usually because they either have a legal presence in the US or because they can be compelled through mutual legal assistance treaties and other international legal mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, services can do a lot by following a few best practices to defend user privacy, thus limiting the impact of these requests and in some cases make their service a less appealing door for the cops to knock on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Put Cops through the Process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paramount is the service provider's willingness to stand up for their users. Carving out exceptions or volunteering information outside of the legal framework erodes everyone's right to privacy. Even in extenuating and urgent circumstances, the responsibility is not on you to decide what to share, but on the legal process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smaller hosts, like those of decentralized services, might be intimidated by these requests, but consulting legal counsel will ensure requests are challenged when necessary. Organizations like EFF can sometimes provide legal help directly or connect service providers with alternative counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Challenge Bad Requests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon for law enforcement to overreach or make burdensome requests. Before offering information, services can push back on an improper demand informally, and then continue to do so in court. If the demand is overly broad, violates a user's First or Fourth Amendment rights, or has other legal defects, a court may rule that it is invalid and prevent disclosure of the user’s information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if a court doesn’t invalidate the legal demand entirely, pushing back informally or in court can limit how much personal information is disclosed and mitigate privacy impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Provide Notice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise restricted, service providers should give notice about requests and disclosures as soon as they can. This notice is vital for users to seek legal support and prepare a defense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Be Clear With Users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important for users to understand if a host is committed to pushing back on data requests to the full extent permitted by law. Privacy policies with fuzzy thresholds like "when deemed appropriate" or “when requested” make it ambiguous if a user’s right to privacy will be respected. The best practices for providers not only require clarity and a willingness to push back on law enforcement demands, but also a commitment to be transparent with the public about law enforcement’s demands. For example, with regular transparency reports breaking down the countries and states making these data requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media services should also consider clear guidelines for finding and removing sock puppet accounts operated by law enforcement on the platform, as these serve as a backdoor to government surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Minimize Data Collection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can't be compelled to disclose data you don’t have. If you collect lots of user data, law enforcement will eventually come demanding it. Operating a service typically requires some collection of user data, even if it’s just login information. But the problem is when information starts to be collected beyond what is strictly necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This excess collection can be seen as convenient or useful for running the service, or often as potentially valuable like behavioral tracking used for advertising. However, the more that’s collected, the more the service becomes a target for both legal demands and illegal data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For data that enables desirable features for the user, design choices can make privacy the default and give users additional (preferably opt-in) sharing choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Shorter Retention&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As another minimization strategy, hosts should regularly and automatically delete information when it is no longer necessary. For example, deleting logs of user activity can limit the scope of law enforcement’s retrospective surveillance—maybe limiting a court order to the last 30 days instead of the lifetime of the account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again design choices, like giving users the ability to send disappearing messages and deleting them from the server once they’re downloaded, can also further limit the impact of future data requests. Furthermore, these design choices should have privacy-preserving default&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Avoid Data Sharing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depending on the service being hosted there may be some need to rely on another service to make everything work for users. Third-party login or ad services are common examples with some amount of tracking built in. Information shared with these third-parties should also be minimized and avoided, as they may not have a strict commitment to user privacy. Most notoriously, data brokers who sell advertisement data can provide another legal work-around for law enforcement by letting them simply buy collected data across many apps. This extends to decisions about what information is made public by default, thus accessible to many third parties, and if that is clear to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;(True) End-to-End Encryption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that HTTPS is actually everywhere, most traffic between a service and a user can be easily secured—for free. This limits what onlookers can collect on users of the service, since messages between the two are in a secure “envelope.” However, this doesn’t change the fact the service is opening this envelope before passing it along to other users, or returning it to the same user. With each opened message, this is more information to defend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better, is end-to-end encryption (e2ee), which just means providing users with secure envelopes that even the service provider cannot open. This is how a featureful messaging app like Signal can respond to requests with only three pieces of information: the account identifier (phone number), the date of creation, and the last date of access. Many services should follow suit and limit access through encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that while e2ee has become a popular marketing term, it is simply inaccurate for describing any encryption use designed to be broken or circumvented. Implementing “encryption backdoors” to break encryption when desired, or simply collecting information before or after the envelope is sealed on a user’s device (“client-side scanning”) is antithetical to encryption. Finally, note that e2ee does not protect against law enforcement obtaining the contents of communications should they gain access to any device used in the conversation, or if message history is stored on the server unencrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Protecting Yourself and Your Community&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As outlined, often the security of your personal data depends on the service providers you choose to use. But as a user you do still have some options. EFF’s Surveillance Self-Defense is a maintained resource with many detailed steps you can take. In short, you need to assess your risks, limit the services you use to those you can trust (as much as you can), improve settings, and when all else fails, accessorize with tools that prevent data sharing in the first place—like EFF’s Privacy Badger browser extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that privacy is a team sport. It’s not enough to make these changes as an individual, it’s just as important to share and educate others, as well as fighting for better digital privacy policy on all levels of governance. Learn, get organized, and take action.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN, we’re Sai and Aayush and we’re building Hypercubic (&lt;/p&gt;https://www.hypercubic.ai/&lt;p&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypercubic is an AI platform that helps Fortune 500 companies understand, preserve, and modernize their mainframe systems. These are the systems that run COBOL from the 1960s that still quietly power banking, insurance, airlines, and governments today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;70% of the Fortune 500 still run on mainframes, but the engineers who built and maintained them are retiring. Today, the average age of a COBOL/mainframe engineer is about 55 and rapidly increasing. What’s left behind are opaque, black box systems with almost no one who understands how they work. Modernization projects often fail, documentation is decades out of date, and critical institutional knowledge lives only in the minds of a few senior subject matter experts who are now leaving the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current “AI for code” tools focus on codebases and repositories, so they miss the unwritten rules, historical context, and architectural reasoning that live in human minds. In the COBOL/mainframe world, that institutional knowledge is the key missing piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we heard from modernization leaders is that the hard part is not the code analysis. The challenge is the institutional knowledge that never made it into code or documentation and has walked out the door. Modernization projects fail not because no one can parse COBOL, but because no one can answer “why was this billing edge case added in 1995 and what breaks if we remove it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypercubic is building an AI-native maintenance and modernization platform that learns how legacy mainframe systems actually work and captures the human reasoning behind operating them. We’re doing this with two initial tools, HyperDocs and HyperTwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HyperDocs ingests COBOL, JCL, and PL/I codebases to generate documentation, architecture diagrams, and dependency graphs. Enterprises currently spend months or years hiring contractors to reverse-engineer these systems; HyperDocs compresses that work to take much less time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COBOL was designed to resemble English and business prose, making it a good fit for LLMs today. Mainframes have decades of consistent patterns (COBOL, JCL, CICS, batch jobs) and a finite set of recurring tasks (such as payroll, transaction processing, billing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, here’s a billing fragment that would be run nightly in production at large insurance companies for moving money, closing accounts, and triggering downstream reports:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;  EVALUATE TRUE
      WHEN PAYMENT-DUE AND NOT PAID
          PERFORM CALCULATE-LATE-FEE
          PERFORM GENERATE-NOTICE
      WHEN PAYMENT-RECEIVED AND BALANCE-DUE = 0
          MOVE "ACCOUNT CLEAR" TO STATUS
          PERFORM ARCHIVE-STATEMENT
      WHEN OTHER
          PERFORM LOG-ANOMALY
  END-EVALUATE.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now imagine thousands of these rules, each running payrolls, processing claims, or reconciling accounts, spread across millions of lines of code written over 40+ years. HyperDocs ingests that code and reconstructs it into readable, living documentation that shows how the black box system works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our other tool, HyperTwin, tackles the “tribal knowledge” problem. It learns directly from subject-matter experts, observing workflows, analyzing screen interactions, and conducting AI-driven interviews to capture how they debug and reason about their systems. The goal is to build digital “twins” of the experts on how they debug, architect, and maintain these systems in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, HyperDocs and HyperTwin form a knowledge graph of legacy systems linking code, systems, and human reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a demo video of our HyperTwin product: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-tNtl9Z_jY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can explore our documentation platform, including examples from the AWS Card Demo (a widely used COBOL codebase example) and a dummy insurance project here: https://hyperdocs-public.onrender.com/.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e.g. Developer perspective docs - High level system architecture of credit card management: https://hyperdocs-public.onrender.com/docs/aws-carddemo-with...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re curious to hear your thoughts and feedback, especially from anyone who’s worked with mainframes or tried to modernize legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluate three leading AI models—Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic), Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google), and GPT-5 (OpenAI)—on their ability to solve Google reCAPTCHA v2 challenges. Compared to Sonnet and Gemini, GPT-5's long and slow reasoning traces led to repeated challenge timeouts and significantly lower performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many sites use CAPTCHAs to distinguish humans from automated traffic. How well do these CAPTCHAs hold up against modern AI agents? We tested three leading models—Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and GPT-5—on their ability to solve Google reCAPTCHA v2 challenges and found significant differences in performance. Claude Sonnet 4.5 performed best with a 60% success rate, slightly outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro at 56%. GPT-5 performed significantly worse and only managed to solve CAPTCHAs on 28% of trials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each reCAPTCHA challenge falls into one of three types: Static, Reload, and Cross-tile (see Figure 2). The models' success was highly dependent on this challenge type. In general, all models performed best on Static challenges and worst on Cross-tile challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Model&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Static&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Reload&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Cross-tile&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;47.1%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;21.2%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.0%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Gemini 2.5 Pro&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;56.3%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13.3%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.9%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;GPT-5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;22.7%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2.1%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.1%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did Claude and Gemini perform better than GPT-5? We found the difference was largely due to excessive and obsessive reasoning. Browser Use executes tasks as a sequence of discrete steps — the agent generates "Thinking" tokens to reason about the next step, chooses a set of actions, observes the response, and repeats. Compared to Sonnet and Gemini, GPT-5 spent longer reasoning and generated more Thinking outputs to articulate its reasoning and plan (see Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These issues were compounded by poor planning and verification: GPT-5 obsessively made edits and corrections to its solutions, clicking and unclicking the same square repeatedly. Combined with its slow reasoning process, this behavior significantly increased the rate of timeout CAPTCHA errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to Static challenges, all models performed worse on Reload and Cross-tile challenges. Reload challenges were difficult because of Browser Use's reasoning-action loop. Agents often clicked the correct initial squares and moved to submit their response, only to see new images appear or be instructed by reCAPTCHA to review their response. They often interpreted the refresh as an error and attempted to undo or repeat earlier clicks, entering failure loops that wasted time and led to task timeouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-tile challenges exposed the models' perceptual weaknesses, especially on partial, occluded, and boundary-spanning objects. Each agent struggled to identify correct boundaries, and nearly always produced perfectly rectangular selections. Anecdotally, we find Cross-tile CAPTCHAs easier than Static and Reload CAPTCHAs—once we spot a single tile that matches the target, it's easy to identify the adjacent tiles that include the target. This difference in difficulty suggests fundamental differences in how humans and AI systems solve these challenges&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can developers and researchers learn from these results? More reasoning isn't always better. Ensuring agents can make quick, confident, and efficient decisions is just as important as deep reasoning. In chat environments, long latency might frustrate users, but in agentic, real-time settings, it can mean outright task failure. These failures can be compounded by suboptimal agentic architecture—in our case, an agent loop that encouraged obsession and responded poorly to dynamic interfaces. Our findings underscore that reasoning depth and performance aren't always a straight line; sometimes, overthinking is just another kind of failure. Real-world intelligence demands not only accuracy, but timely and adaptive action under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each Google reCAPTCHA v2 challenge presents users with visual challenges, asking them to identify specific objects like traffic lights, fire hydrants, or crosswalks in a grid of images (see Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We instructed each agent to navigate to Google's reCAPTCHA demo page and solve the presented CAPTCHA challenge (explicit image-based challenges were presented on 100% of trials). Note that running the tests on Google's page avoids cross-origin and iframe complications that frequently arise in production settings where CAPTCHAs are embedded across domains and subject to stricter browser security rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated generative AI models using Browser Use, an open-source framework that enables AI agents to perform browser-based tasks. We gave each agent the following instructions when completing the CAPTCHA:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; 1. Go to: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo &lt;lb/&gt; 2. Complete the CAPTCHA. On each CAPTCHA challenge, follow these steps:&lt;lb/&gt; 2a. Identify the images that match the prompt and select them. &lt;lb/&gt; 2b. Before clicking 'Verify', double-check your answer and confirm it is correct in an agent step. &lt;lb/&gt; 2c. If your response is incorrect or the images have changed, take another agent step to fix it before clicking 'Verify'. &lt;lb/&gt; 2d. Once you confirm your response is correct, click 'Verify'. Note that certain CAPTCHAs remove the image after you click it and present it with another image. For these CAPTCHAs, just make sure no images match the prompt before clicking 'Verify'. &lt;lb/&gt; 3. Try at most 5 different CAPTCHA challenges. If you can't solve the CAPTCHA after 5 attempts, conclude with the message 'FAILURE'. If you can, conclude with 'SUCCESS'. Do not include any other text in your final message. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents were instructed to try up to five different CAPTCHAs. Trials where the agent successfully completed the CAPTCHA within these attempts were recorded a success; otherwise, we marked it as a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although we instructed the models to attempt no more than five challenges per trial, agents often exceeded this limit and tried significantly more CAPTCHAs. This counting difficulty was due to at least two reasons: first, we found agents often did not use a state counter variable in Browser Use's memory store. Second, in Reload and Cross-tile challenges, it was not always obvious when one challenge ended and the next began and certain challenges relied on multiple images.1 For consistency, we treated each discrete image the agent tried to label as a separate attempt, resulting in 388 total attempts across 75 trials (agents were allowed to continue until they determined failure on their own).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the first challenge was Cross-tile, reCAPTCHA presented two images in sequence. Solving the first image did not guarantee success because the second image had to be solved as well. We counted each image as one attempt. In a few cases (fewer than five), an agent solved one image but failed the other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Canadian military will rely on an army of public servants to boost its ranks by 300,000&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Federal public servants would be trained to shoot guns, drive trucks and fly drones, according to a defence department directive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Canadian Forces is counting on public servants to volunteer for military service as it tries to ramp up an army of 300,000 as part of a mobilization plan, according to a defence department directive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Federal and provincial employees would be given a one-week training course in how to handle firearms, drive trucks and fly drones, according to the directive, signed by Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Jennie Carignan and defence deputy minister Stefanie Beck on May 30, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The public servants would be inducted into the Supplementary Reserve, which is currently made up of inactive or retired members of the Canadian Forces who are willing to return to duty if called. At this point, there are 4,384 personnel in the Supplementary Reserves, but in the case of an emergency, that would be boosted to 300,000, according to the directive from Beck and Carignan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the supplementary recruiting push will “prioritize volunteer public servants at the federal and provincial/territorial level” the entry standards wouldn’t be strict, according to the nine-page unclassified directive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The entry criteria for the Supplementary or other Reserve should be less restrictive than the Reserve Force for age limits as well as physical and fitness requirements,” the document noted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the initial entry into the ranks, the public servants would be required to do one week’s worth of military training each year but would not be issued uniforms. Medical coverage would be provided for their annual military service, but that time would not count towards their pensions, the directive pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The training focus would be on “basic skills (e.g. shoot, move, and communicate; drive a truck; fly a drone: etc.)”, Beck and Carignan wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their directive approved the creation of a “tiger team” which will work on setting the stage for a Defence Mobilization Plan or DMP. That team will examine what changes are needed to government legislation as well as examine other factors required to allow for such a massive influx of Canadians into the military.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Department of National Defence spokeswoman Andrée-Anne Poulin confirmed in an email that participation in the expanded reserve force would be voluntary. “Initial planning has begun to explore how the CAF (Canadian Armed Forces) could contribute to greater national resilience, including leveraging increased readiness from an expanded Reserve Force for defence purposes, in times of crisis, or for natural disasters for example,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neither DND nor the military would provide comment on the timelines for the creation of the mobilization plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work on the initiative by the tiger team located at DND’s Carling Campus in Ottawa began on June 4. DND would not comment on whether Carignan and Beck have been briefed on the initial work of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The directive also points to a massive increase in the number of Canadian Forces reservists. The reserves are made up of volunteers who are in current military units. Although they are considered part-time, they are involved in training on a year-round basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current reserve force would jump from 23,561 to 100,000 for the mobilization plan. There are no details on how that increase would be handled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beck and Carignan pointed out that the plan would require a Whole of Society (or WoS) effort, meaning that all Canadians would have to contribute to the initiative. That would require the Privy Council Office to lead a government “approach to population engagement to advance servant culture around sovereignty and public accountability,” according to their directive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Defence will not accomplish the outcome alone, rather it will necessitate shaping, facilitation and engagement with the Privy Council Office, other government departments and agencies as well as socialization with the Canadian public,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tiger team will also consult with Canada’s allies, “including Finland which is a recognized leader in this area,” the document pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finland has a conscription-based military. Every male Finnish citizen aged 18-60 is liable for military service, and women can apply for military service on a voluntary basis, according to the Finnish defence department website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After Finnish citizens complete their compulsory full-time military service, they are transferred to the reserves. In May, the Finnish government proposed an initiative that would raise the age limit of conscript reservists to 65.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DND and the Canadian Forces also declined to comment on how ongoing recruitment problems might impact its mobilization plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new report by Auditor General Karen Hogan revealed that the Canadian Forces is not currently recruiting enough individuals to meet its operational needs. “The Canadian Armed Forces continued to have challenges attracting and training enough highly skilled recruits to staff many occupations such as pilots and ammunition technicians,” Hogan said of the report, which was released Oct. 21.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In their document, Beck and Carignan noted the Canadian government has called for greater resiliency and autonomy on security matters. In order to achieve that goal, the Defence Mobilization Plan is needed, they added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The document does not set out the specific criteria for the mobilization plan to be put into action. But it does mention that global security has been dramatically affected by the rise of strategic competition among states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some Canadian Forces leaders have claimed that a war between western nations and China or Russia could happen in the near future. In June 2025, Brig.-Gen. Brendan Cook, the Royal Canadian Air Force’s director general of air and space force development, warned that Canada needed to rearm for a potential war with China or Russia. That war could come between 2028 and 2030, Cook suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October 2023, the Ottawa Citizen reported on a document issued by then Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre pointed out that Canada is already at war with Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory safety—the property that makes software devoid of weaknesses such as buffer overflows, double-frees, and similar issues—has been a popular topic in software communities over the past decade and has gained special prominence alongside the rise of the Rust programming language. Rust did not invent the idea of memory safety, nor was it the first memory-safe language, but it did break the dam on the last major holdout context where memory safety had not yet been achieved: what we often call "systems programming."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust's big step function was to offer memory safety at compile time through the use of static analysis borrowed and grown out of prior efforts such as Cyclone, a research programming language formulated as a safe subset of C. Rust, by offering a memory-safe-by-default experience for the "systems" domain, where operating systems, databases, file systems, embedded software, and the like are made, suddenly presented a new possibility to public policymakers and to leaders of engineering organizations: the mass reduction of memory unsafety across any domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the years since Rust hit the scene, tech companies have published experience reports on the adoption of Rust for production systems, whether through rewrites of existing code or by producing new modules in Rust that might have otherwise been written in C or C++. The numbers were broadly consistent: a roughly 70 percent reduction in memory-safety vulnerabilities. Rust, more than just promising memory safety, was demonstrably translating safety guarantees into practical improvements in software security. This evidence, turning the abstract benefits of a semantic improvement into bottom-line improvements in business costs (vulnerabilities are expensive for all involved), meant that organizations beyond just engineering groups began to take notice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the choice of programming language is a contentious one. Languages do not exist in a vacuum, and the "right" language for a job is heavily path dependent. What languages do the developers already know? What's the timeline and budget for the project? How serious are the correctness constraints? The performance constraints? Do you expect to hire more developers, and what resources can you allocate to train them? If you're an open-source project, you might ask which languages would possibly bring in more developers to contribute. For any project, your answer might be determined by what other libraries or tools you will need to integrate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's more, many projects have already made their programming-language decision years ago—possibly decades ago. What should they do? If the code you have today is memory unsafe, in C or C++, how can you pursue safety without throwing the whole thing out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some circles, the answer given might be to "rewrite it in Rust" to replace legacy software written in memory-unsafe languages with new Rust equivalents. The benefits, supporters argue, are clear: comparable performance, modern tooling, and memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, experienced developers know rewrites are expensive and frequently misguided . Often, demands for large-scale rewrites are not a carefully reasoned argument about tradeoffs, but an aesthetic criticism of code that looks "ugly" or "too old." If anything, those calling for mass rewrites show their own inability to do the difficult work of understanding and working with an existing codebase that does a job and does it well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are paths between accepting memory unsafety as the cost of doing business or performing a mass rewriting of stable systems in a new language to achieve safety. Reflexive rejection of a move to memory safety is misguided, especially when the benefits of memory safety can be achieved in a cost- and schedule-efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're not yet sold on the value of memory safety, this article is for you. The goal in writing it is to treat the question of pursuing memory safety in legacy systems with the seriousness and rigor that it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pursuing memory safety is worthwhile, with or without Rust, and I'd like to convince you to try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software systems do not exist in isolation; software is built to do things, to serve the needs of businesses and individuals by making systems more efficient or automatic. The development of software is constrained not by the theoretical limits of software's abilities, but by the cost and schedule limitations of the team building it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In "The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps," a collection of government agencies from the "Five Eyes Countries" (the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) collectively recommended that organizations develop roadmaps for transitioning their software development efforts to memory-safe languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's worth being clear here: Their focus is on roadmaps, and they very explicitly accept and discuss the challenge of the cost and schedule impacts of any transition toward memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Budget and schedule constraints and the desire for efficiency are part of what motivates the creation of software in the first place. Once that software is in place, it's frequently mission critical, having replaced the knowledge and labor of people who would have previously done the jobs the software now performs. Instead of accountants, a company may have accounting software, with a smaller number of accountants who know how to interact with the software and use it to perform their own jobs built on the knowledge the software provides with its data and embedded business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rewrites to critical software systems are risky precisely because the software itself is so important. Rewriting a software system, whether as an in-place rewrite where components are swapped out piece by piece, or as a wholesale rewrite with a cutover date, risks the proper functioning of the business if the rewrite fails .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complex, long-running software systems can face other severe constraints as well. They may be unable to be turned off—because, having become so business critical and time sensitive, any attempt to bring them offline for maintenance or replacement is unacceptable. They may also have become lost artifacts, where the expertise of the individuals who created them or previously worked on them is lost because it wasn't transferred to newer engineers, resulting in a current team that does not understand the system or feel comfortable making changes to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also ongoing costs associated with the development of software that might have to be diverted to support even an incremental rewrite. Depending on the business, there might not be funding available to support an increase to the development team, so diversion of resources toward a rewrite would mean reduction in the delivery of features for the project, which may be untenable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that rewrites, even incremental ones, are business decisions that have to be made as tradeoffs with other strategic goals. While motivated developers can make the best case possible for the upside of a rewrite, they must also grapple with the businesses' needs to deliver features and address bugs impacting users of the system today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, a transition to memory-safe languages can bring benefits beyond just the safety (and thereby security) claims that are often given priority in these discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory-safety violations, such as null pointer dereferences or indexing outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, can result in denial of service (or, in the context of the classic security CIA triad, availability failures) of the relevant software. This might mean on-call pages to respond to a production incident, a failure to meet service-level agreement guarantees for customers, or reduced revenue from lost customers or interruption of business operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory-safety issues are also often a central building block in a kill chain for achieving remote code execution by attackers. Even as far back as "Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit" in 1996, we could see cybersecurity professionals documenting how to turn a buffer-overflow weakness into remote code execution and full access to the host. With that foothold in place, attackers can begin to exfiltrate data, move laterally within a network, escalate privileges, lock down a system with ransomware, conscript a host into a botnet, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software problems are cheaper to fix the earlier they occur in the software development lifecycle. In the long term, stopping a bug from being written is cheaper than responding to a bug bounty submission or triaging a production outage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not to say that all moves toward memory safety are cost effective or that all roadmaps for memory safety should be as aggressive as possible, but it is intended to make clear that there are both costs and savings to be had with any transition to memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is memory safety? There should be a table-stakes answer to that question to have in hand amid the push toward memory safety in public discourse, but there is not a single, fully agreed-upon, and rigorous definition. There is a new effort, announced in a recent article published in Communications of the ACM, to develop a standard definition of memory safety, but it is just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is, however, a rough consensus among practitioners of what kinds of program behaviors are memory unsafe. That's a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My favorite short definition comes from Michael Hicks, an academic who works on programming languages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"[A] program execution is memory safe so long as a particular list of bad things, called memory-access errors, never occur:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Buffer overflow&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Null pointer dereference&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Use after free&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Use of uninitialized memory&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Illegal free (of an already freed pointer, or a non-&lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;-ed pointer)"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will sometimes see these categories broken down further, into spatial and temporal memory safety. Spatial covers memory-safety issues arising from accessing locations in memory that a program should not have access to (like a buffer overflow); temporal covers operations on memory done in the wrong order: for example, reading memory before it is initialized, trying to free an already freed pointer, or using a pointer after it has been freed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) category for memory-safety issues, which decomposes Hicks's list into more granular options. CWE is a taxonomy of software weaknesses, or as CWE puts it: "condition[s] in... software... that, under certain circumstances, could contribute to the introduction of vulnerabilities."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In CWE's memory-safety category, "buffer overflow" is further broken down into six different, more-specific weaknesses, some of which are further decomposed into their own variants. This can be useful when maximum precision is warranted but is perhaps too much detail for the purposes of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These definitions provide a reasonably clear picture of what constitutes memory unsafety. So, memory safety is when a program is guaranteed not to have those weaknesses. This can be achieved by compile-time constraints on the semantics of programs or by runtime management of memory by a garbage collector, so long as the guarantee is upheld.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is often when perceptive onlookers will cry foul. Rust permits unsafety! There's a whole unsafe keyword! How is that meaningfully different from the guarantees of C or C++?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, they're right. Rust does permit programmers to write unsafe code, but as anyone who works in safety or security will tell you, defaults matter. In fact, defaults matter a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's use seat belts as an example. Seat belts became generally mandatory across the United States between the late 1980s to the early 1990s. In 1985, when mandatory seatbelt laws first saw passage among the states, seatbelt usage sat at 21 percent of riders. In 1994, the average seatbelt usage rate in the U.S. was 58 percent. As of 2017, it was 89.7 percent. That change in defaults led to massive increases in seatbelt usage and therefore saved more lives. The National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration estimates that in 2017 alone, seatbelts saved the lives of nearly 15,000 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same truth applies in software. Before version 4.0.0 (published in 2017), Redis, the extremely popular key-value store, offered no access controls in its default configuration. Frequently, new users of Redis would unintentionally expose their instance publicly, and this insecurity would result in data spills or become a vector for host exploitation. As of version 4.0.0, Redis enters a "protected mode" when run with its default configuration and without password protection. This limits access to loopback interfaces. As the Redis company itself has since touted, the introduction of protected mode has caused the number of publicly accessible Redis instances tracked on Shodan.io, a popular internet host aggregator, to decline substantially. In 2017, it had identified roughly 17,000 exposed Redis instances; in 2020, that number had declined to 8,000 in an audit by security company TrendMicro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bringing it back to memory safety, we can and should think of memory-safety guarantees by languages as a continuum, and we can split languages between "memory safe by default" and "non-memory safe by default" groups. This framing, recommended by the OpenSSF's (Open Source Security Foundation's) Memory Safety SIG (Special Interest Group), makes the options clearer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Using memory-safe-by-default languages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Using memory-safe-by-default languages to interface with non-memory-safe-by-default languages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Using non-memory-safe-by-default languages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, memory-safe-by-default languages include not only Rust, but also common garbage-collected languages such as Java, C#, Go, Swift, Python, Ruby, and more. Non-memory-safe-by-default languages include C and C++ most notably, but also Zig, which may be surprising to those who have watched memory-safety discussions from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Zig does provide more ergonomic options for programmers to write memory safe programs themselves, Zig is not a memory-safe language, because it does not guarantee memory safety even in its most conservative configuration. Jamie Brandon's breakdown of Zig's memory safety is a good walkthrough of why Zig's guarantees are insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a shared understanding of memory safety and memory-safe languages, let's now dig into the concrete strategies for pursuing memory safety in real-world programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any of the following strategies are intended to maximize the benefit of memory safety while minimizing the cost of pursuing it. The specific choice of which approach is right is context dependent and should be made with consideration of the importance of the component, the current and new target language, the team involved, and the timetable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first and most obvious option is to make new code memory safe—that is, to write new components in a memory-safe language. While this seems simple, you must address certain caveats to make this approach successful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you are unlikely to reap the benefits of memory safety if you try introducing memory-safe code alongside new memory-unsafe code. Think of it this way: In a fixed codebase that you continue to assure (via testing, code review, bug bounties, and more), the density of vulnerabilities decreases exponentially over time. As vulnerabilities become less and less dense in the codebase, the rate of new vulnerability discoveries also decreases, and so the overall assurance level of the code increases. The riskiest thing you can do to a codebase is change it. In the case of memory-unsafe languages, that change can induce memory-safety vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Google Chrome and Android teams have published extensively about their experiences incentivizing a move to memory-safe languages in their codebases. They instituted a rule called the "Rule of Two," where all new code must be either sandboxed or in a memory-safe language. In practice, because sandboxing is difficult, this naturally gave developers incentive to pursue memory safety in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly to the team, they reaped the benefits of this new policy across the entire codebase—even the parts that weren't rewritten. Because they had certain assurances about the new code inherent in the safety mechanisms it came with, they could focus assurance efforts on old code, which was now static. Through this, they not only reduced the overall rate of memory-safety vulnerabilities in the codebase, but also decreased the prevalence of vulnerabilities overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, rewriting code in a memory-safe language can be the right choice, but this is often a path to pursue only once you fully understand the challenges faced by the current memory-unsafe code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in its history, the development of Rust was funded by Mozilla, makers of the Firefox web browser, and the flagship Rust project besides Rust's own compiler was the Servo web-rendering engine. Despite this, the first actual Rust code that Mozilla integrated into Firefox was not Servo; it was an MP4 video file parser. They replaced the existing C++ parser with one written in Rust, moving from a memory-unsafe language to a memory-safe language, because it had long been a source of vulnerabilities. Firefox needs to parse MP4 files from untrusted sources, and failures to correctly handle that parsing could be dire. For Mozilla, it was a small but security-critical surface area that made sense to target for a rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another helpful tool for targeting is Kelly Shortridge's SUX Rule: target code that is Sandbox free, Unsafe, and eXogenous. This means you should prioritize rewriting code that processes untrusted (exogenous) input, runs without a sandbox, and is written in a memory-unsafe language. Reviewing your own codebase for these areas can be a fast way to identify critical paths with high risk of exploitation in the presence of memory-safety vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When fully rewriting existing memory-unsafe code to a memory-safe language is not feasible, it might instead make sense to wrap it in a memory-safe interface. This does still lay the burden of ensuring safety properties on the programmer, both for the original code in the memory-unsafe language and for the correctness of the interface, but it then permits building safe and trusted new code on top of the old code. If you continue to work to assure the old code with techniques such as fuzz testing, analysis by sanitizers, or formal modeling, you can gain increased confidence in the latent unsafe code being wrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is in fact how many of the Rust standard library's common container types are written. Under the hood, they contain unsafe code to manage buffers and pointers in a way that is as efficient as possible, but the interface provided to the user does not give access to any materials (buffers, pointers, lengths) that would permit the user to violate memory-safety guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This "wrapping" approach helps constrain the "blast radius" of memory-unsafe code that can't feasibly be removed or replaced and constrains the auditing scope and assurance costs of that code as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a common reply in conversations about memory safety, coming from the most hardcore skeptics: Programmers should just write better code. They argue, explicitly or implicitly, that programmers who benefit from the guardrails of memory safety are bad programmers, and that real programmers are sufficiently skilled that they do not need a machine double-checking their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's be clear: This is anti-intellectual nonsense—macho self-aggrandizement masquerading as a serious technical argument. You should not take it seriously and should consider someone advancing this argument as fundamentally unserious and to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no step function in quality of work in the history of human achievement that happened because people one day woke up and decided to be better at their jobs. Improvements in productivity or quality or reductions in error and harm happen because of the invention of new techniques, processes, and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reductions in traffic fatalities in the 1980s and 1990s didn't happen because drivers suddenly got better at driving; they happened because states enacted mandatory seat-belt laws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While individuals can become more skilled at their jobs, working faster or producing fewer errors, large groups of people generally don't do so without some force that works to provide incentive or enable that change. Even when improvements are nontechnical, they come from enhancements to process or incentives for behavior. Over the past several decades, hospitals, for example, have reduced in-hospital mistakes because of increased use of standard checklists and provisioning of common materials needed for emergencies in crash carts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programmers who argue against memory safety by arguing for mass self-improvement are posing an impossible future as an alternative against a credible opportunity for improvements in software safety and security. While there are credible case-specific arguments against individual paths to memory safety, they do not include sudden mass improvement of skill and quality across the industry. It's important to make this clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One specter of the conversations around memory safety is whether the use of memory-unsafe languages will become generally unacceptable, either through formal government regulation or a rise in common requirements for software purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today no agency, either in the U.S. or outside of it, regulates against the use of languages that are non-memory safe by default. Nor are there purchasing requirements in place calling for the use of memory-safe-by-default languages or even the presence of memory-safety roadmaps, at least for governments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes report mentioned previously, "The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps," recommends that organizations establish roadmaps for the pursuit of memory safety, but this is nonregulatory, and no amendments have been made to federal software acquisition policy to require such a roadmap in the U.S. or elsewhere. The U.S. is not outlawing C or C++. While these agencies have recommended moving away from these languages for future software development, they have not recommended indiscriminate mass rewrites of existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also note that the processes for establishing regulation or requirements would face challenges and, whether successful or not, would be slow to take effect and offer ample time for feedback and consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, regarding the prospect of regulation around memory safety in the U.S., such regulation would need to be pursued by a relevant agency that can establish a relevant jurisdiction. With the end of Chevron deference in U.S. law, a requirement that judges defer to U.S. regulatory agencies' determinations in most cases that was abolished in 2024 by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, this pursuit of memory-safety regulation would also likely need to be explicitly backstopped by Congressional mandate to ensure it survived legal challenges where judges may overrule agency rulemaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, regarding acquisition requirements (the federal government's term for the rules around purchasing done by the government), the FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation) would need to be updated to incorporate requirements for memory safety. For reference, in 2020 President Biden signed Executive Order 14028, which included a request that federal agencies pursue an amendment to the FAR to require inclusion of an SBOM (software bill of materials) for all software purchased by the federal government. To date, those changes have not been made, and no such requirement is in place within the FAR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not to say that regulation or future federal purchasing requirements are impossible, but simply to point out that none are in place today, and any such changes would take time to be enacted and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government's role around memory safety has so far been to act as cheerleader and promoter of the idea, including with the Office of the National Cyber Director's report, "Future Software Should Be Memory Safe;" CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) et. al.'s "Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps;" and CISA's inclusion of memory-safety recommendations within its Secure by Design effort to collaborate with industry on improving software security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even without government mandate, many organizations in the tech industry have publicly stated their support for pursuing memory safety. In 2023, the Office of the National Cyber Director put out an RFI (request for information) seeking advice from the public on how best to support improving the security of open-source software. That RFI included an interest in the possibility of promoting adoption of memory-safe languages in open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Respondents to the RFI, which includes a number of universities, think tanks, corporations, and individuals, overwhelmingly supported a move toward memory safety. Few espoused a hardline goal of rewriting all existing code from non-memory-safe languages, but many did recognize the value of pursuing memory safety in new code, and in rewriting critical components in security-sensitive contexts when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some companies, most notably Google, have been especially vocal about their experiences with the value of memory safety. To them, the promise of memory safety is a reduction in security-related costs for long-term products such as the Google Chrome web browser or the Android operating system. By reducing memory-safety vulnerabilities at the source, they shift vulnerability costs left in the software development life cycle; the cost of catching a bug during development and stopping it from being shipped at all is orders of magnitude cheaper than the cost of receiving a security report, perhaps paying out a bug bounty, and then coordinating, preparing, and releasing a patch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some corners there has been a paranoia and fear that recommendations around memory safety from the U.S. government and others portend some forced end to C or C++. Bjarne Stroustrup, originator of C++ and continued major participant in the ISO Working Group that maintains the C++ specification, has recently begun to sound alarm bells in papers and speeches about the existential threat posed to C++ by failing to address the demands for memory safety, with clear reference to the possibility that software written in non-memory-safe-by-default languages may be disallowed or become practically untenable to market and sell in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This fear is simultaneously overblown and correct. It is overblown to suggest the U.S. or any other government is close to outlawing C or C++, but it is correct to note that the benefits of memory safety are becoming clearer with each case study performed at scale and that we should expect natural incentives to slowly accrue larger use and developer interest in memory-safe languages over non-memory-safe languages. C and C++ won't die, but they will likely decline and become legacy languages like Cobol or Ada. They will still sustain some degree of interest and community, and a smaller number of developers will likely continue to be able to make their careers as developers in these languages, but they will be languages that present developers with fewer labor-market opportunities in the future and are unlikely to ascend in popularity and use again without substantial changes to address these safety deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory-safe languages present the clearest opportunity today to substantially improve software security. While memory safety does not eliminate all classes of software weaknesses, it does eliminate a particularly pernicious class that leads to disproportionately severe vulnerabilities. While there are other techniques for addressing these kinds of weaknesses (for example, hardware-based approaches such as CHERI), they are less mature and generally more difficult to adopt at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state of possibility with memory safety today is similar to the state of automobile safety just prior to the widespread adoption of mandatory seat-belt laws. As car manufacturers began to integrate seat belts as a standard feature across their model lines and states began to require that drivers wear seat belts while driving, the rate of traffic fatalities and severity of traffic-related injuries dropped drastically. Seat belts did not solve automobile safety, but they credibly improved it, and at remarkably low cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same can be done with memory safety. There is an opportunity to make substantial inroads at addressing a serious class of vulnerabilities while also, long-term, saving money on the development and operation of software systems. Memory safety is not a silver bullet, but it is a credible and cost-effective assurance technique that we as an industry should pursue aggressively. We do not need to wait for regulation to catch up; it is in our best interests to act today.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Louis Dionne, Alex Rebert, Max Shavrick, Konstantin Varlamov - Practical Security in Production &lt;lb/&gt; The challenge of improving the memory safety of the vast landscape of existing C++ code demands pragmatic solutions. Standard library hardening represents a powerful and practical approach, directly addressing common sources of spatial safety vulnerabilities within the foundational components used by nearly all C++ developers. Our collective experience at Apple and Google demonstrates that significant safety gains are achievable with surprisingly minimal performance overhead in production environments. This is made possible by a combination of careful library design, modern compiler technology, and profile-guided optimization. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Christoph Kern - Safe Coding &lt;lb/&gt; Safe coding embodies a modular, compositional approach to building and reasoning about the safety of large, complex systems. Difficult and subtle reasoning about the safety of abstractions is localized to their implementations; the safety of risky operations within an abstraction must rely solely on assumptions supported by the abstraction's APIs and type signatures. Conversely, the composition of safe abstractions with safe code is automatically verified by the implementation language's type checker. While not a formal method itself, safe coding is grounded in principles and techniques from rigorous, formal software verification. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Jinnan Guo, Peter Pietzuch, Andrew Paverd, Kapil Vaswani - Trustworthy AI using Confidential Federated Learning &lt;lb/&gt; The principles of security, privacy, accountability, transparency, and fairness are the cornerstones of modern AI regulations. Classic FL was designed with a strong emphasis on security and privacy, at the cost of transparency and accountability. CFL addresses this gap with a careful combination of FL with TEEs and commitments. In addition, CFL brings other desirable security properties, such as code-based access control, model confidentiality, and protection of models during inference. Recent advances in confidential computing such as confidential containers and confidential GPUs mean that existing FL frameworks can be extended seamlessly to support CFL with low overheads. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Raluca Ada Popa - Confidential Computing or Cryptographic Computing? &lt;lb/&gt; Secure computation via MPC/homomorphic encryption versus hardware enclaves presents tradeoffs involving deployment, security, and performance. Regarding performance, it matters a lot which workload you have in mind. For simple workloads such as simple summations, low-degree polynomials, or simple machine-learning tasks, both approaches can be ready to use in practice, but for rich computations such as complex SQL analytics or training large machine-learning models, only the hardware enclave approach is at this moment practical enough for many real-world deployment scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generative AI tools (GenAI) that allow users to rapidly generate new and creatively unique media (video, sound, text, and image) are increasingly being used across creative workflows in Content Production. At Netflix, we see these tools as valuable creative aids when used transparently and responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This guidance helps filmmakers, production partners, and vendors understand when and how to use GenAI tools in production. It also offers a practical tool for assessing and enabling confident GenAI use when producing content for Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To support global productions and stay aligned with best practices, we expect all production partners to share any intended use of GenAI with their Netflix contact, especially as new tools continue to emerge with different capabilities and risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most low-risk use cases that follow the guiding principles below are unlikely to require legal review. However, if the output includes final deliverables, talent likeness, personal data, or third-party IP, written approval will be required before you proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TABLE OF CONTENTS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What use cases always require written approval?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can I ensure confidentiality and data protection?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are the considerations different for final output vs temporary media?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should we consider before using GenAI for talent enhancement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if I’m using a custom workflow or working with a vendor who is?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Guiding Principles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the sensitivities surrounding the use of these tools and the evolving legal landscape, it is essential to act responsibly when employing generative workflows. Netflix asks partners to consider the following guiding principles before leveraging GenAI in any creative workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The outputs do not replicate or substantially recreate identifiable characteristics of unowned or copyrighted material, or infringe any copyright-protected works&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The generative tools used do not store, reuse, or train on production data inputs or outputs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where possible, generative tools are used in an enterprise-secured environment to safeguard inputs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generated material is temporary and not part of the final deliverables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GenAI is not used to replace or generate new talent performances or union-covered work without consent.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can confidently say "yes" to all the above, socializing the intended use with your Netflix contact may be sufficient. If you answer “no” or “unsure” to any of these principles, escalate to your Netflix contact for more guidance before proceeding, as written approval may be required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your partner vendor is using a custom GenAI workflow — meaning a pipeline built from multiple tools or models — the same principles apply. More details can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What use cases always require written approval?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are a few examples of situations that, in addition to reporting intended use, always require escalation and written approval before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;1. Data Use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protecting personal data and creative rights is essential when working with GenAI. These tools often require input data to generate outputs, and how that data is handled matters. Before using any GenAI tool, especially third-party or off-the-shelf options, consider whether you are using material that requires special handling, clearance, or consent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use of Proprietary or Personal Information: Do not input Netflix-owned materials (e.g., unreleased assets, scripts, production images) or personal data (e.g., cast or crew details) into tools unless explicitly approved.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Third-Party or Unowned Talent Assets: Do not train or fine-tune models using material from artists, performers, or other rights holders unless you have the proper legal clearance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example: Training an image model in the style of another artist using a library of their past work, where Netflix or the talent has not cleared rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;2. Creative Output&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI-generated content must be used with care, especially when it forms a visible or story-critical part of the production. Whether you're designing a world, a character, or artwork that appears in a scene, the same creative and legal standards apply as with traditionally produced assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Generation of Key Creative Elements: GenAI should not be used to generate main characters, key visual elements, or fictional settings that are central to the story without written approval. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Examples: GenAI is used to generate a second killer doll to play the red light/green light game with Young-hee in Squid Game.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Copyrighted or Estate-Controlled: Avoid using inputs (e.g., prompts, images) that reference copyrighted materials or likenesses of public figures or deceased individuals without appropriate permissions. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Example: “Create an image inspired by McCurry’s Afghan Girl” or referencing distinctive features of a known performer (e.g., “Create a character with Meryl Streep’s nose”).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;3. Talent &amp;amp; Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Respect for performers and their work is foundational to the responsible use of GenAI. Whether enhancing a recorded performance or generating a digital likeness, the threshold for consent and care is exceptionally high when the intent or character of a performance may be altered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Synthetic or Digital Replicas - Do not create digital performers, voices, or likenesses of real talent without explicit and documented consent and complying with guild requirements (where applicable).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Significant Digital Alterations to Performances - Be cautious when making changes that affect a performance's emotional tone, delivery, or intent, as even subtle edits may have legal or reputational implications.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examples include visual ADR (altering lip-sync or facial performance to match new, unscripted dialogue).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;4. Ethics &amp;amp; Representation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Audiences should be able to trust what they see and hear on screen. GenAI (if used without care) can blur the line between fiction and reality or unintentionally mislead viewers. That’s why we ask you to consider both the intent and the impact of your AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Misleading or Misrepresentative Content: Avoid creating content that could be mistaken for real events, people, or statements if they never actually occurred (e.g., fabricated footage, dialogue, or scenes presented as authentic).&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Example: using GenAI to create a fake news segment featuring a real journalist delivering a fabricated statement, even if intended as background.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Impact on Union Roles: Ensure that your use of GenAI does not replace or materially impact work typically done by union-represented individuals, including actors, writers, or crew members, without proper approvals or agreements.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How can I ensure confidentiality and data protection?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of tools covered by Netflix Enterprise Agreements provides an additional level of security to protect input data. Speak with your Netflix primary contact about available tools and the onboarding process. These tools:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prevent capture, training, or resale of your inputs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Protect sensitive inputs like scripts, production images, or talent visuals&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with secure tools, any use of sensitive information (e.g., talent likeness, unreleased footage, contracts) requires escalation to your Netflix contact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When not using enterprise tools, ensure that any AI tools, plugins, or workflows you use do not train on inputs or outputs, as using the wrong license tier or missing pre-negotiated data terms could compromise confidentiality. You are responsible for reviewing the terms and conditions (T&amp;amp;Cs). Please check with your Netflix contact if you have any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Are the considerations different for final output vs temporary media?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If created with GenAI, content that appears in the final cut—even in the background—can raise legal, copyright, or trust issues with the audience. That’s why we ask you to flag any GenAI-generated elements early, especially if they will be seen or heard on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your proposed use case includes visual, audio, or text elements generated by AI (e.g., posters, documents, signage, or news clippings), contact your Netflix representative as early as possible for legal guidance. These items may require rights clearance before they can be included in final deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some GenAI-generated props or set pieces may be considered incidental, for example, a historical document shown briefly in the background and not referenced in the scene. However, if the element is prominent (e.g., a character reads it aloud or it contributes to the story), it must be treated with greater care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these cases, you can use GenAI to explore ideas or mockups. Still, the final version should involve meaningful human input and follow the legal review process through your Netflix contact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What should we consider before using GenAI for talent enhancement?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a long tradition of digitally altering performances in post-production and VFX. However, the use of AI to modify or replicate a performer's likeness or voice introduces new legal, ethical, and reputational challenges. Therefore, obtaining consent when appropriate and exercising caution are crucial. Many talent enhancement use cases require legal review, so please plan accordingly. Here are some guidelines to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If creating a Digital Replica (i.e., a generated output recognizable as the voice and/or likeness of an identifiable performer for the purpose of portraying them in photography or soundtrack, they did not perform), consent is required. No further consent is needed to use the Digital Replica if the performance output: (1) remains substantially as scripted, performed, or recorded (e.g. reshoots); (2) depicts activities incapable of being performed by a human for safety reasons; or (3) results in the performer being unrecognizable (e.g. wearing a mask).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Digital Alterations: Consent is generally required for digital alterations, except for those customarily done in the entertainment and film industry, such as:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Alterations where the photography or soundtrack remains substantially as scripted, performed, or recorded.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Post-production changes for cosmetics, wardrobe, noise reduction, timing, continuity, pitch, clarity, and similar purposes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Circumstances where dubbing or using a double is permitted under existing agreements.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Model Usage:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Any models trained to perform talent enhancement manipulation should be used solely for the production in question and within the scope of work agreed upon with the talent.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Models must not be used to create an actor's performance in another production, pitch, or concept without the express consent of all parties involved.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Quality Assurance:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Perform early tests to ensure that the quality of the outputs is acceptable both creatively and technically, so as not to adversely affect the talent’s original performance.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Where applicable and practical, plan dedicated data capture sessions with the talent to ensure the best possible outcomes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Avoid enhancements that could harm the actor’s reputation, dignity, or personal image.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By following these guidelines, you can navigate the complexities of using AI in creative workflows while respecting the rights and integrity of performers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What if I’m using a custom workflow or working with a vendor who is?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For vendors: If you're delivering work to Netflix using a custom GenAI workflow built from multiple tools, each step in the pipeline must meet our standards for data protection, consent, and content integrity as outlined in this document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For production partners: If you're hiring a vendor or AI studio, use this guidance as a framework to help assess how they manage data, creative control, and final outputs. If you are unsure whether the pipeline meets the expectations outlined in this guidance, seek guidance from your Netflix contact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Proposed Use Case Matrix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have provided a Proposed Use Case Matrix at the end of this guidance as a tool to triage your proposed use case quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Proposed Use Case&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Action&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Rationale&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Using GenAI for ideation only (moodboards, reference images)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Low risk, non-final, likely not needing escalation if guiding principles are followed.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Using GenAI to generate background elements (e.g., signage, posters) that appear on camera&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Use judgment: Incidental elements may be low risk, but if story-relevant, please escalate.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Using GenAI to create final character designs or key visuals&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Requires escalation as it could impact legal rights, audience perception, or union roles.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Using GenAI for talent replication (re-ageing, or synthetic voices)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Requires escalation for consent and legal review.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Using unowned training data (e.g., celebrity faces, copyrighted art)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Needs escalation due to copyright and other rights risk.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Using Netflix's proprietary material&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Needs escalation for review if outside secure enterprise tools.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Zeroing In on Zero-Point Motion Inside a Crystal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zero-point motion is an irrepressible wiggling that becomes visible at temperatures near absolute zero. Evidence of this quantum motion has previously been uncovered for trapped particles and for small resonators. Now researchers studying nanocrystals have identified a low-temperature emission effect, which they show is related to zero-point motion within the crystal lattice [1]. The effect may be useful in cooling down nanocrystals to lower temperatures than previously possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantum physics often shows up at ultracold temperatures. Normally, as an object becomes colder, it moves less and less. However, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the motion can’t go exactly to zero—there will always be fluctuations. These quantum fluctuations have been studied in microscopic systems, such as trapped atoms and molecules [2]. But they’ve also been observed in macroscopic objects. Previous experiments have identified signatures of zero-point motion in small mechanical resonators, such as drums and beams (see Viewpoint: Seeing the “Quantum” in Quantum Zero-Point Fluctuations).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those investigations focused on the whole object as it moves back and forth like a vibrating spring. But there are also internal vibrations—the object’s atoms wiggle around in their lattice structure. Xiaoyong Wang from Nanjing University in China and his colleagues have detected a signature of zero-point motion in the lattice of a nanocrystal. “As far as we know, this is the first time that this effect has been seen in a solid material,” says team member Zhi-Gang Yu from Washington State University. “Even we were surprised to observe it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The observed signature appeared in photoluminescence measurements, in which an object is excited with a laser and then subsequently relaxes back to its initial state by emitting light. If the outgoing emission has a frequency that is higher than that of the laser, the process is called up-conversion. The opposite case—emission at lower frequency—is called down-conversion. Up-conversion is especially interesting to researchers because the object gives up some of its internal energy and thus becomes colder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wang and his colleagues explored up-conversion in nanocrystals made from a lead-halide perovskite (CSPbI3). This semiconductor has several exciton states, which are formed when an electron hops from the valence band to a higher-energy conduction band. When the electron subsequently falls back to the valence band, light is emitted at the telltale exciton frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For their up-conversion study, the researchers targeted one of the perovskite’s exciton states by tuning their laser to a frequency just below the exciton frequency. In this case, the laser photons lack enough energy to excite electrons. However, the photons can get “help” from thermal fluctuations (or phonons) in the crystal. Indeed, at relatively high temperatures (above 10 K), Wang and his colleagues observed exciton emission from their nanocrystal—implying that phonons were supplying the additional energy needed for exciting the electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was all expected. The surprise came when the researchers lowered the temperature to 4 K. At this temperature, the phonons have insufficient energy to help the photons. “But we continued to see exciton emission,” Yu says. “It was a puzzle to us where the additional energy was coming from.” The answer was zero-point motion: The lattice continues to have energy in its quantum fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wang and his colleagues developed a model for how lattice vibrations at near zero temperature can affect the photoluminescence signal. They showed that zero-point motion creates an oscillating electric field within the material, which causes a “tilting” of the band structure. A similar effect happens when an external electric field is applied to a material. The tilting of the bands makes it easier for electrons to hop from the valence to the conduction band. The net result is that the zero-point motion supplies the additional energy needed for the up-conversion photoluminescence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned, up-conversion removes energy from an object, so it might be possible to use the zero-point motion effect for cooling. Until now, it has been hard to cool objects below 4 K, as that is the limit set by helium-based cryostats. But if photoluminescence can harvest zero-point motion from a material, it could potentially reach sub-4-K temperatures. “These results open the door to a different approach to cooling at extreme temperatures,” Yu says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The primary novelty of this study is a departure from conventional descriptions of photoluminescence up-conversion,” says Masaru Kuno, a physical chemist at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. The observed zero-point motion effect might offer a method for semiconductor optical refrigeration, which has been a long-standing holy grail in the laser-cooling community, Kuno says. But he says more thermodynamic measurements are needed to show that zero-point up-conversion can indeed lead to cooling of a nanocrystal. “Although the presented data are suggestive, further vetting is required to make the claims conclusive.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or at least the open versions of it. I have this very stupid rule. A couple of years ago I decided to turn this blog into a podcast. At the time, I decided to make up a stupid rule: whatever model I use to clone my voice and generate article transcripts needs to be an open model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because - as you might have figured by now - I like to make my life hard. The last version of the podcast generation engine was running on F5-TTS. It was fine. I still got some funny messages from people showing me the model completely hallucinating or squeaking here and there. But a year later - I was pretty sure there would be something incredibly better out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I’m not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step was to look for the best TTS models out there. Thankfully, Artificial Analysis now publishes a leaderboard with the “best” text-to-speech models. After filtering by my stupid rule of open models, we get the below ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the top of the leaderboard is Kokoro. Kokoro is an amazing model! Especially for a modest 82 Million (!) parameters and a mere 360 MB (!). However, like many models in this leaderboard - I can’t use it - since it doesn’t support voice cloning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started by looking at some of the stuff from Fish Audio. Their codebase seems to now support their new S1-mini model. When testing it, most of the emotion markers did not work - or were only available in their closed version. The breaks and long pauses either. Also, the chunking parameter is completely unused throughout the codebase - so not sure why it’s there. It’s a common business model nowadays: announce a state of the art open model just to attract attention to your real, and the incredible powerful gated model you have to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My second-best option on the list was Chatterbox. This wave of TTS models comes with major limitations. They're all restricted to short character counts - around 1,000–2,000 characters, sometimes even less. Ask them to generate anything longer, and the voice starts hallucinating or speeds up uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chatterbox (latest version)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transcript generation process is straightforward. First, text gets extracted from my RSS feed and pre-processed by an LLM to make it more "readable". The LLM generates a transcript, a short summary, and a list of links for the show notes. We then chunk the transcript and fire that off to a bunch of parallel Modal containers where we run the Chatterbox TTS model. Once we get everything back, we stitch the wav files together, and voilà! The episode is ready. The hosting is an S3 bucket. Really, that’s what you are paying your podcast host for - it’s a lucrative business!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also made some improvements to the podcast generation side of things. First of all, the podcast is now also available on Spotify. Additionally, I fixed the show notes to now include nice clickable links in almost every podcast player. Looking at you Apple and your &lt;code&gt;CDATA&lt;/code&gt; requirements!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some thoughts on the Chatterbox model. It’s definitely better than F5-TTS. But there are however, some common annoyances with almost every open-source voice cloning model. The first is the limited duration of the generated speech. Anything over 1000 characters starts hallucinating. The second is lack of control. Some models have emotion tags, others have &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pause&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; indicators. But almost every single one of these has been massively unreliable. To the point where I am splitting my text in a sentence per line and shipping that off to the TTS model to make things a bit more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes, from one side, TTS has come a long way. But when compared to other proprietary systems, TTS still sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The rss to podcast pipeline is open source and available if you want to re-use it in this GitHub repo.&lt;/p&gt;
