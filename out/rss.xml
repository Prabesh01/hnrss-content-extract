  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, GOG Team here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Michał Kiciński, one of the co-founders of CD PROJEKT, and the co-founder of GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why GOG and Michal Kicinski are getting together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the games that shaped us deserve to stay alive: easy to find, buy, download, and play forever. But time is annoyingly good at erasing them. Rights get tangled, compatibility breaks, builds disappear, and a nostalgic evening often turns into a troubleshooting session. That’s the difference between “I’m playing today” (the game lives on) and “I’ll play someday” (the game dies).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Michał put it: “GOG stands for freedom, independence, and genuine control.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński first came up with the idea for GOG in 2007, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players, and make sure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you, forever. In a market increasingly defined by mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, that philosophy feels more relevant than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision. We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What it means for you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, DRM-free is more central to GOG than ever. Your library stays yours to enjoy: same access, same offline installers, same sense of ownership. Your data stays with GOG, and GOG GALAXY remains optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll keep our relationship with CD PROJEKT. CD PROJEKT RED games will continue to be available on GOG, and upcoming titles from the studio will also be released on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a GOG Patron, or you donate to support the Preservation Program, those funds stay within GOG. Your support has been huge this year, and we think that with your help, we can undertake even more ambitious rescue missions in 2026 and 2027. We’ll have more to say about that sometime in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GOG will remain independent in its operations. We will continue building a platform that’s ethical, non-predatory, and made to last, while helping indie developers reach the world. We’re also committed to giving the community a stronger voice, with new initiatives planned for 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for being the reason this all matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of companies sell games. Fewer do the unglamorous work of making sure the games that shaped people’s lives don’t quietly rot into incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for caring about this mission with us. We’ll keep you posted as we ship, and in the meantime, you can dig into the full FAQ for the detailed answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is happening?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michał Kiciński, the original co-founder of GOG and co-founder of CD PROJEKT, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT. GOG will continue operating as GOG, a distinct company, with the same mission to Make Games Live Forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is GOG’s position in this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To us at GOG, this feels like the best way to accelerate what is unique about GOG. Michał Kiciński is one of the people who created GOG around a simple idea: bring classic games back, and make sure that once you purchase a game, you have control over it forever. With him acquiring GOG, we keep long-term backing that is aligned with our values: freedom, independence, control, and making games stay playable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is Michał Kiciński doing this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because he wants to preserve and grow the original philosophy behind GOG. In a PC market that keeps moving toward mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, he believes GOG’s approach is more relevant than ever: no lock-in, no forced platforms, sense of ownership. His goal is to keep supporting both gamers and developers, and strengthen GOG’s mission: preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is CD PROJEKT doing this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Selling GOG fits CD PROJEKT’s long-term strategy. CD PROJEKT wants to focus its full attention on creating top-quality RPGs and providing our fans with other forms of entertainment based on our brands. This deal lets CD PROJEKT keep that focus, while GOG gets stronger backing to pursue its own mission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Does the mission of GOG change?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. Our mission remains to Make Games Live Forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is DRM-free still central to GOG?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. DRM-free is more central to GOG than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What happens to my GOG account?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing changes. Your account stays a GOG account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is GOG financially unstable?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. GOG is stable and has had a really encouraging year. In fact, we’ve seen more enthusiasm from gamers towards our mission than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Will my tips or GOG Patrons donations be shared with Michał Kiciński, or any other party?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. These funds stay within GOG to support preservation work, and they are not shared with publishers or other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What happens to my library?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing. Your library remains yours to enjoy, even if a game gets delisted, as it always has.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I still download offline installers?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Will you share my data with Michał Kiciński, or other parties?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. GOG remains the controller of your data, and nothing changes here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Will CD PROJEKT RED games continue to release on GOG?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CD PROJEKT RED games will continue to be available on GOG, and upcoming titles from the studio will also be released on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A major link in Tesla’s 4680 battery supply chain has just snapped. South Korean battery material supplier L&amp;amp;F Co. announced today that the value of its massive supply deal with Tesla has been slashed by over 99%, signaling a catastrophic drop in demand for the automaker’s in-house battery cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is arguably the strongest evidence yet that Tesla’s 4680 program, and the vehicle that relies on it, the Cybertruck, is in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early 2023, L&amp;amp;F announced a $2.9 billion contract to supply high-nickel cathode materials directly to Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, the industry saw this as a major move by Tesla to secure materials for its ramp-up of the 4680 battery cell, which Elon Musk had touted as the key to halving battery costs and enabling cheaper electric vehicles, a plan he later scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, Tesla’s Cybertruck is the only vehicle using the automaker’s own 4680 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a regulatory filing today, L&amp;amp;F revealed that the contract’s value has been written down to just $7,386.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, that is not a typo. $2.9 billion to roughly $7,400.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;L&amp;amp;F did not explicitly state the reason for the cut, citing only a “change in supply quantity,” but the dots are easy to connect. The high-nickel cathode was destined for Tesla’s 4680 cells, and the primary consumer of those cells is the Cybertruck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have been reporting on the Cybertruck’s demand issues for the better part of this year. In March, we noted that the truck was turning out to be a flop as Tesla began offering discounted financing to move inventory. By June, Tesla became desperate, launching 0% APR incentives as inventory piled up in lots across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite a production capacity of 250,000 units per year at Giga Texas, the Cybertruck is currently selling at a run rate of roughly 20,000 to 25,000 units annually. We even saw Tesla discontinue the cheapest Cybertruck in September because, frankly, no one wanted a gutted version of a truck that was already struggling to find buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Tesla isn’t building Cybertrucks, it doesn’t need 4680 cells. And if it doesn’t need 4680 cells, L&amp;amp;F has no one to sell its cathode material to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Electrek’s Take&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a good look Tesla’s 4680 program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, we’ve been told that the 4680 cell was the “holy grail” that would allow Tesla to produce a $25,000 electric car. But five years after Battery Day, the cells are still reportedly difficult to manufacture at scale due to the dry electrode process, and their only application is a low-volume pickup truck that has become a commercial failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The math here is brutal. A 99% reduction in a supply contract basically means the contract was cancelled. It means Tesla is not ramping 4680 production; if anything, they might be winding it down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by stetrain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Battery Day we were supposed to have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A standardized 4680 cell format for Tesla vehicles produced not just by Tesla but by all of their other battery suppliers (LG, Panasonic, CATL, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cars with 54% more range&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;56% reduction in $/kWh at the vehicle level&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A Model S Plaid Plus with over 520 miles of range&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A $25k passenger car&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of those have happened. As far as I know none of Tesla's cars except the Cybertruck are even using the structural battery pack design or 4680 form-factor cells. And that vehicle falls far short of the originally marketed 500 miles of range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact their competitors are beating them to it. BMW and Rivian are both using 46XX format cells for their mass market vehicles from Samsung, LG, and others with cell-to-pack and structural battery pack designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ‘Cybercab’ is also supposed to be using the 4680 cells, but we will have to wait and see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also a vehicle program that could go the way of the Cybertruck. CEO Elon Musk is insisting that it will launch in early 2026 without a steering wheel, but Tesla has yet to solve level 4 autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it does launch without a steering wheel, it will be a program even more limited in volume than the Cybertruck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The battery supply situation and the critical minerals behind it are evolving fast, and China controls most of it. In a new Substack, I shared a full list of the years of reserve remaining for each mineral.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI Is Forcing Us To Write Good Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When Best Practices Are Best&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, we’ve all known what “good code” looks like. Thorough tests. Clear documentation. Small, well-scoped modules. Static typing. Dev environments you can spin up without a minor religious ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These things were always optional, and time pressure usually meant optional got cut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents need these optional things though. They aren’t great at making a mess and cleaning it up later. Agents will happily be the Roomba that rolls over dog poop and drags it all over your house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only guardrails are the ones you set and enforce. If the agentic context is lacking and the guardrails aren’t sufficient, you’ll find yourself in a world of pain1. But if the guardrails are solid, the LLM can bounce around tirelessly until the only path out is the correct one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our six-person team has made a lot of specific and, sometimes, controversial investments to accommodate our agentic coders. Let’s talk about some of the less obvious ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;100% Percent Code Coverage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most controversial guideline we have is our most valuable: We require 100% code coverage2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone is skeptical when they hear this until they live with it for a day. It feels like a secret weapon at times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coverage, as we use it, isn’t strictly about bug prevention; it’s about guaranteeing the agent has double-checked the behavior of every line of code it wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual misinterpretation is that people think we believe 100% coverage means “no bugs”. Or that we’re chasing a metric, and metrics get gamed. Neither of those are the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why 100%? At 95% coverage, you’re still making decisions about what’s “important enough” to test. At 99.99%, you don’t know if that uncovered line in ./src/foo.ts was there before you started work on the new feature. At 100%, there’s a phase change and all of that ambiguity goes away3. If a line isn’t covered, it’s because of something you actively just did.&lt;lb/&gt;The coverage report becomes a simple todo list of tests you still need to write. It’s also one less degree of freedom we have to give to the agent to reason about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a model adds or changes code, we force it to demonstrate how that line behaves. It can’t stop at “this seems right.” It has to back it up with an executable example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other nice benefits: Unreachable code gets deleted. Edge cases are made explicit. And code reviews become easier because you see concrete examples of how every aspect of the system is expected to behave or change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Namespaces Are One Honking Great Idea. Let’s do more of those.4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main mechanism agentic tools use to navigate your codebase is the filesystem. They list directories, read filenames, search for strings, and pull files into context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should treat your directory structure and file naming with the same thoughtfulness you’d treat any other interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A file called ./billing/invoices/compute.ts communicates much more than ./utils/helpers.ts, even if the code inside is identical. Help the LLM out and give your files thoughtful organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, prefer many small well-scoped files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It improves how context gets loaded. Agents often summarize or truncate large files when they pull them into their working set. Small files reduce that risk. If a file is short enough to be loaded in full, the model can keep the entire thing active in context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, it will speed up the agent’s flow and eliminate a whole class of degraded performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fast, Ephemeral, Concurrent Dev Environments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the old world, you lived in one dev environment. This is where you’d craft your perfect solution, tweak things, run commands, restart servers, and gradually converge on a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With agents, you do something closer to beekeeping, orchestrating across processes without knowing the specifics of what exactly is happening within each of them. So you need to cultivate a good and healthy hive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Fast&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need your automated guardrails to run quickly, because you need to run them often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to keep the agent on a short leash: make a small change, check it, fix it, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can run them a few ways: agent hooks, git hooks, or just prompting (i.e. in your AGENTS.md), but no matter how you run them, your quality checks need to be cheap enough that running them constantly is not slowing things down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our setup, every npm test creates a brand new database, runs migrations, and executes the full suite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This only works for us because we’ve made each of those stages exceptionally fast. We run tests with high concurrency, strong isolation, and a caching layer for third-party calls5. We have 10,000+ assertions that finish in about a minute. Without caching, it takes 20-30 minutes, which would add hours if you expected an agent to run tests several times per task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Ephemeral&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you get comfortable with agents, you naturally start running many of them. You’ll spin up and tear down many dev environments multiple times a day. That has to all be fully automated or you’ll avoid doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a simple workflow here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;new-feature &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That command creates a new git worktree, copies in local config that doesn’t live in git (like &lt;code&gt;.env &lt;/code&gt;files), installs dependencies, and then starts your agent with a prompt to interview you to write a PRD together. If the feature name is descriptive enough, it may even just ask to get right to work, assuming it can figure out the rest of the context on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important part isn’t our specific scripts. It’s the latency. If it takes minutes and involves a bunch of tinkering and manual configuration, you won’t do it. If it is one command and takes 1-2 seconds, you’ll do it constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our case, one command gives you a fresh, working environment almost immediately, with an agent ready to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Concurrent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final piece is being able to run each environment at the same time. Having a bunch of worktrees doesn’t help if you can only have one of them active at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means anything that could conflict (e.g. ports, database names, caches, background jobs) needs to be configurable (ideally via environment variables) or otherwise allocated in some conflict-free way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you use Docker you get some of this for free, but the general requirement is the same: you need a solid isolation story so you can run several fully functioning dev environments on one machine without cross-talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;End-To-End Types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More broadly, automate the enforcement of as many best practices as you can. Remove degrees of freedom from the LLM. If you’re not already using automatic linters and formatters6, start there. Make those as strict as possible and configured to automatically apply fixes whenever the LLM finishes a task or is about to commit7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you should also be using a typed language8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entire categories of illegal states and transitions can be eliminated. And types shrink the search space of possible actions the model can take, while doubling as source-of-truth documentation describing exactly what kind of data flows through each layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;TypeScript&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We lean on TypeScript pretty heavily. If something can be reasonably represented cleanly in the type system, we do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we push semantic meaning into the type names. The goal is to make “what is this?” and “where does it go?” answerable at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you’re working with agents, good semantic names are an amplifier. If the model sees a type like &lt;code&gt;UserId&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WorkspaceSlug&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;SignedWebhookPayload&lt;/code&gt;, it can immediately understand what kind of thing it is dealing with. It can also search for that thing easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generic names like &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; are fine when you’re writing a small self-contained generic algorithm, but much less helpful when you’re communicating intent inside a real business system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;OpenAPI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the API side, we use OpenAPI and generate well-typed clients, so the frontend and backend agree on shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Postgres&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the data side, we use Postgres’ type system as best as we can, and add checks and triggers for invariants that don’t fit into simple column types. Postgres doesn’t have a particularly rich type system, but it has enough there to enforce a surprising amount of correctness. If an agent tries to write invalid data, our database will usually complain clearly and loudly. And we use Kysely to generate well-typed TypeScript clients for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of our other 3rd-party clients either give us good types, or we wrap them to give us good types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are tireless and often brilliant coders, but they’re only as effective as the environment you place them in. Once you realize this, “good code” stops feeling superfluous and starts feeling essential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, the upfront work feels like a tax, but it’s the same tax we’ve all been dodging for years. So pay it intentionally. Put it on your agentic roadmap, get it funded by eng leadership, and finally ship the codebase you always hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often, when teams struggle with agentic coding, it’s AI reflecting and amplifying their codebase’s worst tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;100% coverage is actually the minimum bar we set. We encourage writing tests for as many scenarios as is possible, even if it means the same lines getting exercised multiple times. It gets us closer to 100% path coverage as well, though we don’t enforce (or measure) that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also remarkably easy to maintain 100% once you hit it. The coverage report enumerates exactly what lines need testing, which the LLM happily handles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among other mechanisms, we use githooks for this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t use Python. Even with type annotations. Just use TypeScript. It makes me a little sad to say, having written Python for 20+ years, but TypeScript’s is just a much better type system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we run tests in CI/CD, after the PR is approved, we run them without caching just to ensure there wasn’t a subtle assumption violated by the cache. It also double-checks that we’re still talking to all of our 3rd-party integrations correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been a computer programmer all-told for 43 years. That’s more than half the entire history of electronic programmable computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that time, I’ve seen a lot of things change. But I’ve also seen some things stay pretty much exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve lived through several cycles of technology that, at the time, was hailed as the “end of computer programmers”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WYSIWYG, drag-and-drop editors like Visual Basic and Delphi were going to end the need for programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wizards and macros in Microsoft Office were going to end the need for programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Executable UML was going to end the need for programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No-Code and Low-Code platforms were going to end the need for programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now, Large Language Models are, I read on a daily basis, going to end the need for programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These cycles are nothing new. In the 1970s and 1980s, 4GLs and 5GLs were touted as the end of programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And before them, 3GLs like Fortran and COBOL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And before them, compilers like A-0 were going to end the need for programmers who instructed computers in binary by literally punching holes in cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it goes back even further, if we consider the earliest (classified) beginning of electronic programmable computers. The first of them, COLOSSUS, was programmed by physically rewiring it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the engineers who worked on that machine sneered at the people working on the first stored-program computers for not being “real programmers”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In every cycle, the predictions have turned out to be very, very wrong. The end result hasn’t been fewer programmers, but more programs and more programmers. It’s a $1.5 trillion-a-year example of Jevons Paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here we are again, in another cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But this time it’s different, Jason!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, it certainly is. Different in scale to previous cycles. I don’t recall seeing the claims about Visual Basic or Executable UML on the covers of national newspapers. I don’t recall seeing entire economies betting on 4GLs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there’s another important distinction: in previous cycles, the technology worked reliably. We really could produce working software faster with VB or with Microsoft Access. This is proving not to be the case with LLMs, which – for the majority of teams – actually slow them down while making the software less reliable and less maintainable. It’s a kind of LOSE-LOSE in most cases. (Unless those teams have addressed the real bottlenecks in their development process.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But all of this is academic. Even if the technology genuinely made a positive difference for more teams, it still wouldn’t mean that we don’t need programmers anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hard part of computer programming isn’t expressing what we want the machine to do in code. The hard part is turning human thinking – with all its wooliness and ambiguity and contradictions – into computational thinking that is logically precise and unambiguous, and that can then be expressed formally in the syntax of a programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was the hard part when programmers were punching holes in cards. It was the hard part when they were typing COBOL code. It was the hard part when they were bringing Visual Basic GUIs to life (presumably to track the killer’s IP address). And it’s the hard part when they’re prompting language models to predict plausible-looking Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hard part has always been – and likely will continue to be for many years to come – knowing exactly what to ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edgar Dijkstra called it nearly 50 years ago: we will never be programming in English, or French, or Spanish. Natural languages have not evolved to be precise enough and unambiguous enough. Semantic ambiguity and language entropy will always defeat this ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And while pretty much anybody can learn to think that way, not everybody’s going to enjoy it, and not everybody’s going to be good at it. The demand for people who do and people who are will always outstrip supply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Especially if businesses stop hiring and training them for a few years, like they recently have. But these boom-and-bust cycles have also been a regular feature during my career. This one just happens to coincide with a technology hype cycle that presents a convenient excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no credible evidence that “AI” is replacing software developers in significant numbers. A combination of over-hiring during the pandemic, rises in borrowing costs, and a data centre gold rush that’s diverting massive funds away from headcount, are doing the heavy lifting here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there’s no reason to believe that “AI” is going to evolve to the point where it can do what human programmers have to do – understand, reason and learn – anytime soon. AGI seem as far away as it’s always been, and the hard part of computer programming really does require general intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of all that, “AI” coding assistants are really nothing like the compilers and code generators of previous cycles. The exact same prompt is very unlikely to produce the exact same computer program. And the code that gets generated is pretty much guaranteed to have issues that a real programmer will need to be able to recognise and address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I write code, I’m executing it in my head. My internal model of a program isn’t just syntactic, like an LLM’s is. I’m not just matching patterns and predicting tokens to produce statistically plausible code. I actually understand the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even the C-suite has noticed the correlation of major outages and incidents proceeding grand claims about how much of that company’s code is “AI”-generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The folly of many people now claiming that “prompts are the new source code”, and even that entire working systems can be regenerated from the original model inputs, will be revealed to be the nonsense that it is. The problem with getting into a debate with reality is that reality always wins. (And doesn’t even realise it’s in a debate.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, no, “AI” isn’t the end of programmers. I’m not even sure, 1-3 years from now, that this current mania won’t have just burned itself out, as the bean counters tot up the final scores. And they always win.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To folks who say this technology isn’t going anywhere, I would remind them of just how expensive these models are to build and what massive losses they’re incurring. Yes, you could carry on using your local instance of some small model distilled from a hyper-scale model trained today. But as the years roll by, you may find not being able to move on from the programming language and library versions it was trained on a tad constraining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason, I’m skeptical that hyper-scale LLMs have a viable long-term future. They are the Apollo Moon missions of “AI”. In the end, quite probably just not worth it. Maybe we’ll get to visit them in the museums their data centres might become?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The foreseeable future of software development is one where perhaps “AI” – in a much more modest form (e.g., a Java coding assistant built atop a basic language model) – is used to generate prototypes, and maybe for inline completion on production code and those sorts of minor things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, when it matters, there will be a software developer at the wheel. And, if Jevons is to be believed, probably even more of us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Employers, if I were you, I might start hiring now to beat the stampede when everyone wakes up from this fever dream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then maybe drop me a line if you’re interested in skilling them up in the technical practices that can dramatically shrink delivery lead times while improving reliability and reducing the cost of change, with or without “AI”. That’s a WIN-WIN-WIN.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;When someone says they hate your product with a burning passion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What CodeRabbit did, and what to do instead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say you get negative feedback in public. It’s blunt, even abrasive. You instinctively bristle: they’re wrong, they don’t get it, they’re trolling. So naturally, you push back. But your rebuttal only makes the critic double down, and now others are piling on. You clarify your position, but it only gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does this happen, and what can you do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Feedback is a regulatory mechanism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a thermostat for your credibility. People form an opinion on what the correct setting should be, and they regulate if the reality seems off. If you’re above their setpoint, people feel you’re overrated and want to bring you down; if you’re below it, people feel you’re underrated and want to build you up. And the farther off you are, the more they’ll overcorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When someone is frustrated with you (or your company, or your product), they have a view of how much you should be dinged for something. Venting in public is a way to regulate your reputation and achieve the proper homeostasis, like turning a thermostat toward the desired setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that the substance of someone’s feedback is totally separate from their frustration or desire to be heard. Complaints often seem unfair and you might want to jump to fact checking, but that won’t get anywhere unless you first resolve the frustration and make people feel that you actually listened. (It turns out facts do care about our feelings.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Resistance is escalation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you reject someone’s feedback, you’re implying that (1) they’re wrong, (2) they’re possibly dumb, and (3) they don’t have the authority to judge you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, sometimes that’s all true and you need to fight or ignore. But in this case, we’re focusing on substantive feedback from people who matter, like your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By rebutting, you’re forcing them to justify and defend their initial statements. Either they were wrong to raise it or you were wrong to resist! Their choice is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now their move is to escalate further, maybe with more examples or stronger language. As this plays out, onlookers will tend to take the critic’s side, as an angry customer is more relatable than an imperious founder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Aiden v. CodeRabbit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going back to the thermostat analogy, a stubborn dial only makes people twist harder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a recent example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, Aiden Bai posted about grievances with CodeRabbit. Pretty normal so far; users complain about products all the time. A CodeRabbit engineer jumped in to ask for feedback, which was good, and Aiden followed up with details (full context here):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CodeRabbit’s CEO, Harjot, then entered the chat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one post, he&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;called his own customer clueless,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;then implied CodeRabbit had enough users that this feedback didn’t matter,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;then condescendingly speculated that, even if it were valid, it could probably be solved by “simpler controls and a lot of handholding,”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;then, to gild the lily, made sure to insult not only Aiden personally but indie developers as a category.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we should remember that writing a bad response isn’t the same as being a bad person. Harjot was frustrated by what he felt was a bad faith attack on his company, and I have a lot of sympathy for founders getting hater-fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the response was objectively not good, and what came next was predictable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The net upshot was bad vibes for CodeRabbit and a layup for its competitors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The episode finally ended with an apologish from Harjot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My advice for this kind of post is to pick a lane: if it’s an apology, make it a proper one and resist the urge to sprinkle in more veiled jabs. You could also take the other route and just not apologize. It’s best to try avoiding any uncanny valley situations. But it happens: bad interactions are unavoidable and this one wasn’t too damaging in the grand scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to reset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Tolstoy would’ve said, all positive mentions are alike; every negative mention is irksome in its own way. It varies based on who’s involved, what the feedback is, how much traction it’s getting, etc. etc. etc. — there isn’t a universal solution. As I’ve noted, sometimes it really is bad faith trolling, and that calls for a very different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in general, as a founder you should be your own hardest critic. You should have a higher standard for yourself than anyone else could possibly impose. You should be voracious for user feedback, even if it feels unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the magical thing is, when you sincerely feel that way and you demonstrate it, criticism tends to wilt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a scenario where you get negative feedback, and you overrule the instinct to push back. Instead, you listen to the feedback, you embrace the responsibility to make the best product possible, you even thank them for caring enough to share their thoughts (remembering that your real enemy isn’t negativity but indifference).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With just this, you’ll have shown more curiosity, more ownership, more humility than they were even hoping to enforce. They’re surprised to find that the imbalance is now in the other direction. Instead of feeling snubbed or dismissed, they might consider whether their initial jab was excessive. They now risk overcorrecting and overshooting the setpoint they were aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when people feel they’ve gone too far, they restore balance by pulling back. It’s common to see someone gearing up for a confrontation but, upon finding the other person gracious and receptive, pivot to, “Thanks for sharing the context,” “I shouldn’t have overreacted,” “I appreciate how you handled this, “I do like the product overall,” or some other form of deescalation — maybe even an apology or retraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude gets it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When getting negative feedback:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Separate the information part from the emotion part. There’s the substance of the feedback, and there’s the customer’s frustration and expectation of being heard. Those are discrete, and you can’t address the former without resolving the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start by aligning on principles, before rushing to defend yourself. Whatever the merits of the feedback, you agree that quality is important, that feedback is valuable, and that the feedback has found the person who’s responsible. Again, there’s no hope of aligning on facts if you can’t first align on principles.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Make a point of overindexing on accountability. Take more responsibility than what seems necessary. Take so much ownership that it surprises people. This obviates their need to hector you over it and removes a lot of surface area for attack, creating space for a calmer exchange. More importantly, if you’re the founder, the reality is that every detail of your product does fall on you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you need to clarify facts, explain instead of defending. You can share the exact same information in a way that’s either defensive and caustic, or earnest and transparent. The only difference is tone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If self-critique or apology is warranted (it isn’t always), keep it straightforward. No need to grovel or self flagellate. Recap the problem plainly, explain the fix, say what you’re doing to prevent it in the future, and wrap it up. Then move on.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Manus Joins Meta for Next Era of Innovation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The news is out, and it's big: Manus is joining Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This announcement is more than just a headline—it's validation of our pioneering work with General AI Agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the launch, Manus has focused on building a general-purpose AI agent designed to help users tackle research, automation, and complex tasks. Through continuous product iteration, we’ve been working hard to make these capabilities more reliable and useful across a growing range of real-world use cases. In just a few months, our agent has processed more than 147 Trillion tokens and powered the creation of over 80 Million virtual computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe in the potential of autonomous agents, and this development reinforces Manus’s role as an execution layer — turning advanced AI capabilities into scalable, reliable systems that can carry out end-to-end work in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our top priority is ensuring that this change won’t be disruptive for our customers. We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our solution is driving value for millions of users worldwide today. With time, we hope to expand this subscription to the millions of businesses and billions of people on Meta’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,” said Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus. “We’re excited about what the future holds with Meta and Manus working together and we will continue to iterate the product and serve users that have defined Manus from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Get smarter alongside your AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your intelligence shouldn't reset every conversation. Ensue is a persistent knowledge tree that grows with you - what you learn today enriches tomorrow's reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every conversation with an LLM starts from zero. You explain context, re-establish preferences, repeat decisions you've already made. Your knowledge doesn't compound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensue changes that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your knowledge persists - Build a tree of intelligence that spans conversations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Context carries forward - Prior research, decisions, and insights inform new work&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You get smarter together - The LLM learns your thinking patterns, not just facts&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of it as extended memory. When you ask about GPU inference, the LLM checks what you already know. When you make an architecture decision, it connects to past decisions in similar domains. Your accumulated knowledge becomes part of every conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find myself writing yet another toy parser, as one does during a Christmas break. It roughly follows Resilient LL Parsing Tutorial. Not because I need resilience, but mostly because I find producing a syntax tree and a collection of diagnostics a more natural fit for the problem than bailing out on the first error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One practical pitfall with the approach is infinite loops/recursion. Resilience sometimes means not consuming a token, and, if you do that in a loop or a Pratt recursive call, you’ll get yourself an annoying to debug error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a concrete example, you might parse function argument list using code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implicit contract here is that expression consumes at least one token, even if there are errors in the source code. If there’s some token that makes expression bail without consuming anything, the code loops forever, and you’ll need a debugger to get at the stack trace!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way I solved this issue traditionally is via a combination of two techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fuel: parser has a fuel: Cell&amp;lt;u32&amp;gt; field, which is decremented even by “readonly” lookahead methods, and topped up every time the parser consumes a token. Fuel is useful to make you parser crash somewhat cleanly, though the crash is typically still removed from problematic function by several stack frames.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second technique is to maintain a mental map of functions which always consume at least one token of input, and functions which might bail without consuming anything. And, whenever you write a loop or a recursive call, consult this map to be sure to call at least one token-consuming function. Hard and error prone!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I think I’ve figured something better today! You can assert that parser did advance when you expect it to. The smaller benefit here is that if parser didn’t advance, you get an immediate error. The bigger benefit is that these asserts materialize the mental map of advancing functions in the source code, so it doesn’t have to be mental anymore!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seems like an obvious idea in retrospect, but, well, took me more than one parser to figure it out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concretely, I came up with the following base parser API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is the buggy function that lead to the error at the start of the article:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bye Bye Big Tech: How I Migrated to an almost All-EU Stack (and saved 500€ per year)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;“Bye bye bye.” It took some time, and a serious amount of research, but I have finally crossed the finish line. I have officially migrated my digital life to pure, EU-hosted solutions.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a long time, the narrative has been that if you want privacy and data sovereignty, you have to sacrifice usability. But after settling into this new stack, I’ve realized that isn’t true anymore. In fact, most of these tools aren’t just more private; they are significantly better than the US-based giants I left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a breakdown of the tools I’m using, the money I’m saving, and the few hurdles I’m still trying to jump over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;by the way, this post is for personal setups not for companies. Yet, I think most tools can be used for teams and companies too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Backbone: The Proton Ecosystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest impact on this migration has come from Proton. They have matured from a simple encrypted email provider into a (almost) full-suite productivity powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My subscription now covers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mail &amp;amp; Calendar: Encrypted and clean.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Drive: Secure cloud storage, having docs for a while, and now also tables.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proton Pass: A solid password manager with 2FA integration.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;VPN: Fast and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Standard Notes: My go-to for note-taking, now under the Proton umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lumo AI: A privacy-first GenAI, I’m not yet frequently using it, but we will talk about it later.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything is integrated and the user experience is superb. I’m also eagerly awaiting the release of Proton Meet to complete the suite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This entire setup replaces for me my Google Drive and Gmail ecosystem. Plus NordVPN, Notion, 1Password and Authenticator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curious? I will drop you my referral link here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My mixed AI Strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI is the hardest thing to decouple from Big Tech, but improvements are happening fast here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For privacy-first GenAI tasks within my workflow, I’m using Lumo AI. It’s great for quick, private queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, sometimes you need raw power. For that, I started using Mammouth. I use this less for privacy reasons and more for the sheer value and flexibility. Getting access to every major AI model (including image generation) for just €10 is incredible value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My default for Mammouth looks like this. You can sort them in your favourite order; whatever is leftmost is your default one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two models I use most are Mistral Medium 3.1 and Flux 2 Pro or Fast. For simple coding tasks, I also use Mistral, but when playing around with a larger codebase, I have to admit I’m using Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For research, Mistral does its job. But if it becomes complex, I often find Gemini's results to be the best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At last, Flux for images is fantastic. Yet, in my opinion, it comes with a major downside: You have to give a lot of good instructions. Where a Nano Banana seems more creative, even from short, simple inputs, Flux needs precise orders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Browsing, Search, and Language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Browser: I moved to Vivaldi Technologies. It’s highly customizable and respects user data.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Search: My default is Ecosia. It works well, and planting trees while searching adds a nice layer of purpose to mindless scrolling. Yet, every now and then I have to use Google :/&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Translation: I’ve been using DeepL forever. In my opinion, it is still miles ahead of Google Translate in terms of nuance and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Spell Check: … Haven’t found a good alternative, so I stay with Grammarly. Hoping for them to return to Europe with their Superhuman Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Infrastructure: Hosting &amp;amp; Domains&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my website and domains, I moved everything to Scaleway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are technical, you will appreciate this switch. It is lean, simple, and provides everything you need as a cloud provider without the bloat of AWS or Azure. Plus, it’s cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Creativity &amp;amp; Task Management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Canva… what shall I say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the initial discussion I had on LinkedIn (original post), I found Superlist, to which I transitioned from Todoist. I also had a mini stop at MeisterTask, but that was a complete waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MeisterTaks feels like a kindergarten playground, too much colorful design and too little actual functionality. It is 100% not user-intuitive for any workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I’m now on Superlist, and very happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Economics: Privacy is Actually Cheaper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We often assume that “boutique” privacy tools cost a premium. Surprisingly, my migration proved the opposite. Initially, I wrote only about a small saving, but I missed the costs of Notion, Todoist, 1 Password, Claude and Canva as I focused on the “Office” suite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Old Stack cost ca. 83€ per month&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My New EU Stack cost ca. 39€ per month&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m saving over 528 € a year while owning most of my data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where There is Light, There is Shadow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to be transparent: you cannot escape everything, and some things are just harder to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The “Guilty Pleasure”: As a techie, I have too much fun playing with Claude Code. It’s a luxury I treat myself to, so I frequently turn the subscription on. Yet, if you don’t have that use case → Mistral, Lumo&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Social Web: You simply can’t get around LinkedIn, GitHub, YouTube, Medium, Substack and so on if you want to stay connected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;Convenience:&lt;/del&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;I miss a good Google SSO. It is everywhere, and losing that “one-click login” friction does make life slightly more annoying.&lt;/del&gt;I migrated every Login to Proton Pass using MFA and Passkey wherever possible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;Office Suite:&lt;/del&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;I am struggling to get used to LibreOffice and Collabora Online. They feel similar to MS Office, but “not quite.” Since I don’t create documents or spreadsheets every day for personal use, the learning curve feels steeper than it should.&lt;/del&gt;Screw that → Proton Docs and Sheets are doing it. Worst case for slides, I’m going for Canva, I’m paying for it anyhow.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Blogging, Newsletter &amp;amp; Co.: Well, as you can see, I’m writing on Substack. There are no alternatives except to host it entirely yourself, but that doesn’t make sense to me right now.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Unexpected Gems I found&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also found a couple of positive side effects. The Proton platform itself has everything you need for your day-to-day life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, I migrated to a Duo plan with my wife. Together we have 2TB on storage for Mails, Files etc. Before we had 30GB on Gmail, which cost a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proton Pass creates anonymous email addresses in case you don’t want to use your real email address. This plays entirely on Proton's privacy aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superlist is free for the same features Todoist provided me for a little subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I’m always fighting with note-taking. I tested everything and started building something complex on Notion. I’m glad that I could delete it and just use Standard Notes from Proton. In simple terms, it is like notes from Apple, yet E2E encrypted and you can back them up offline. However, most helpful for me is that I finally found a way to work effectively with notes, keep it clean, lean and functional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Proton, Scaleway, Mammouth, Vivaldi, Superlist and DeepL, I have built a useful toolset that, in my opinion, surpasses what I used before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The apps are cleaner, the UI is often more user-friendly, and the migration was surprisingly simple. Best of all, I can do more with my tech stack for less money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve been on the fence about migrating to EU-hosted solutions, take the leap. It’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stranger Things creator Ross Duffer offered a piece of advice to viewers who plan on watching the season 5 premiere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Instagram, Duffer guided fans through their TV settings so they could watch the new season of Stranger Things the way it was meant to be seen. He stated, "A little PSA before you watch tonight. I want to make sure that your TVs are set up properly." He proceeded to tell his followers to turn off all their settings, especially dynamic contrast, super resolution, edge enhancer, and color filter. He even described those features as "garbage."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Stranger Things creator then returns to the picture settings menu, pointing out that viewers should disable noise reduction, too. He also said that truemotion and smoothmotion are the biggest "offenders" and should be turned off most of all because they cause “the dreaded soap opera effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He explains that most televisions will fix many of these problems if you switch to their advanced viewing presets, such as Dolby Vision Movie Dark. However, even those modes aren’t perfect. He urges fans to manually confirm each setting is off and adds, “Whatever you do, do not switch anything on ‘vivid’ because it’s gonna turn on all the worst offenders. It’s gonna destroy the color, and it’s not the filmmaker’s intent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duffer’s advice highlights a conflict between technological advances and creators' goals. Features like the ones he mentioned are designed to appeal to casual viewers by making images appear sharper or more colorful, but they alter the original look of the content. By asking fans to turn these features off, he is stressing the importance of preserving the director’s vision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stranger Things season 5, volume 1, is available to stream now on Netflix. Volume 2 will be released on December 25, 2025, and the finale on December 31, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At MongoDB, protecting our customers’ data is our highest priority. On December 12, 2025, the MongoDB Security Engineering team identified a security vulnerability, described in CVE-2025-14847, which impacts MongoDB Server. Within the security community, this vulnerability is informally referred to as “Mongobleed.” This blog post outlines the situation, our immediate response, and the key insights we’ve gathered so far. Security is an ongoing responsibility in modern software development for both software producers and consumers, and maintaining trust depends on how issues are identified, addressed, and communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This patched security vulnerability in the MongoDB Server products (Community and Enterprise) is not a breach or compromise of MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas (our managed MongoDB Server offering), or our systems. To maintain the highest levels of security, customers and users are advised to use the latest versions of MongoDB’s software that have been updated to address this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability was discovered internally by MongoDB Security Engineering as part of our proactive and continuously evolving security program. Over the last several years, we have increased our investment in people, processes, and technology to analyse and improve our codebase continuously. This work is ongoing, and discoveries like this reinforce the importance of sustained focus in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because how and when we act matters as much as what we do, transparency around timing is important. The following timeline outlines our discovery, validation, remediation, and disclosure efforts from December 12 through December 23, 2025 (all times U.S. ET):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;December 12 at 19:00 – MongoDB Security Engineering detected the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;December 12–14 – We worked continuously to validate the issue and develop and test a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;December 15-17 – We developed and tested our rollout plans to enable rapid and safe deployment at scale, and commenced patching the Atlas fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;December 17 at 12:10 – We completed patching the majority of the Atlas fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;December 17 at 21:00 – Atlas provides an optional feature called “maintenance windows” that provides customers control over when MongoDB applies routine software updates to their Atlas instances. We proactively notified Atlas customers with maintenance windows configured that we would perform an urgent patch the following day, as part of our established policy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;December 18 – We patched the remainder of the Atlas fleet, including those with maintenance windows, and continued customer communications.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;December 19 – We published the vulnerability through the industry-standard CVE process as CVE-2025-14847.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;December 23 – We posted an update on MongoDB’s community forum, sharing the patch and details on how to update.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protecting customers was our top priority throughout this process. Tens of thousands of MongoDB Atlas customers and hundreds of thousands of Atlas instances were proactively patched within days. Because MongoDB manages Atlas, we were able to deploy critical security patches quickly and safely on behalf of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In parallel with our Atlas remediation, we published patch versions of MongoDB for customers running MongoDB Enterprise Advanced. We also made available patched community builds and proactively notified Community Edition users through our community forum. Our goal was to ensure that all MongoDB users, whether running Atlas, Enterprise Advanced, or Community, had access to patches and clear guidance as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with any operational event, this was another opportunity to learn, improve, and raise the bar. The software security space is rapidly evolving with new tools and techniques, and MongoDB will continue to evaluate and deploy new capabilities as part of our deep investment in security for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operating software and services securely at high scale is complex. Our responsibility is to continuously improve our products, act with urgency and transparency, and strengthen how we protect our customers. We appreciate the trust our customers place in MongoDB and remain committed to earning that trust every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;– Jim Scharf, Chief Technology Officer, MongoDB&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Videogames, at least the kind I’m talking about (RPGs, adventure kinds of somewhat narrative videogames, Zelda games, Elden Ring, etc), have essentially three “places”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outside – Hyrule field. Most of the game is Outside, just running around in a grassy area or a snowy mountain. It’s kind of the glue between all of the elements but there can be all manner of things Outside. Outside is the most flexible, but it typically has the lowest density of monsters, NPCs, shops, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dungeon – The sewers, the final boss’ castle, a factory full of monsters, or a literal dungeon. Dungeons have LOTS of monsters, treasure, and usually a boss. You go into a dungeon to kinda clear it, get the treasure, kill the boss. Dungeons rarely have NPCs or shops in them (Shiren the Wanderer is an exception that comes to mind).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Town – This is where most NPCs are, but also the highest concentration of “specific activities”. Towns are dense, there’s often shops, minigames, quests, etc. Kakariko Village from Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite towns. There are almost never fights in town – you are almost always entirely safe in town.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, any time you try to boil down reality into a nice neat little categorization system like this, you’re going to be missing a lot of details, but broadly speaking, I think this holds up pretty well. I’m playing through Final Fantasy VII Rebirth now (which I am loving) and it’s very clear in that game, whether you are in Outside, Dungeon or Town, pretty much at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Videogames are a language, and this pattern is an important building block in that language. It is kind of good that you know you’re always safe in town. It is kind of good that you know what you’re in for when entering a big scary difficult dungeon, and so on. So, I am not saying that we get rid of these designations, at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I’m asking for&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I would love, though, is some more messiness in how they are implemented. Kakariko Village from Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite towns because there are some “grey area” parts, especially underground. It also has a dungeon, arguably inside it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would love a dungeon that connects to the back of someone’s house in a town. Or one part in town that is kind of more Outside-like, like a little forest in there. Or maybe something that’s like 50% dungeon, 50% town.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want the borders of these places to be a little blurrier. It always bothers me in newer games when I enter a dungeon and text pops up on the screen saying “Gorbath’s Cove” or something. Developers do that so that players get a little “check box” feeling, that they have checked another Location off of the List Of Locations, and gotten that much closer to 100%-ing the game. There’s not nothing to that, but it has a cost. The cost of this kind of “instancing” is that the player is sort of robbed of the feeling of discovering a place for themselves. When I first see a cave, I’m like, whoa, there’s a little cave!! But then I walk in and get an announcement, telling me that this is a known site, that my discovery isn’t special, and also that there are many places just like this one in this game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not really that impressed by the underworld of Tears of the Kingdom, specifically because it is so clearly “its own map”. I would much prefer that, throughout Hyrule, there was a network of messy underground areas. Maybe one cave system has a place where it connects to a dungeon, which connects also to a basement in some guy’s house in the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The existence of these “three places” is a good thing for videogames and I am not saying that we abandon it. However, I think we should “break the rules” a lot more frequently, because a world that breaks the rules is a world that invites and cultivates a sense of wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope to do a lot of this with my own game, Free Tiya Bannet, which I’m working on now. I want the first town to be, yes, a town. It does have shops, and you are mostly safe in most of it. But maybe there’s one area where you aren’t safe. Maybe there’s an underground part of it that is kind of a dungeon. Maybe it even connects to a secret definitely-dungeon, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Videogames, especially the higher budget games, have a tendency towards being conservative: making sure that everyone understands exactly what is happening at all times. I think this is a valid thing to care about, but I also think that, like all things, it’s a balancing act, and I think too many games have been falling on the too-conservative part of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Location: Bangalore, India (Koramangala) Compensation: Competitive Salary + Significant Equity (YC Standard) Founders: Shardul Lavekar (ex-Airtel AI, ex-Ola) &amp;amp; Parth Mudgal (ex-Flipkart, ex-Ola)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At 100x.bot, we are building the interface for this future. We are not just another "AI Wrapper." We are a deep-tech company backed by Y Combinator, Accel, and Inventus, solving the hardest problem in automation: making browser agents reliable, fast, and accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most AI agents today are slow, expensive, and hallucinate frequently because they "think too hard" about every click. We take a different approach: "Record once, Automate forever." We combine the deterministic speed of record-and-replay technology with the semantic intelligence of LLMs to create agents that utilize self-healing DOM maps to navigate the chaotic web with human-like resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Opportunity: More Than Just UI We are looking for a Frontend Craftsperson to join our core engineering team in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is not a role for someone who just wants to center divs or convert Figma files into React components. We are looking for an engineer who can architect the client-side experience for autonomous agents. You will be building the "cockpit" from which users control their digital workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What You Will Architect The Agent Visualization Engine: You will build complex, interactive graph-based interfaces that visualize agent workflows. Users need to see the logic flow—loops, conditionals, and "self-healing" events—in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dynamic MCP Interfaces: You will build systems that dynamically generate UIs based on Model Context Protocol schemas. If an MCP server exposes a new tool, your UI should instantly adapt to support it, without a code deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;High-Performance Streaming UI: Our agents generate massive logs (DOM snapshots, network events, execution traces). You will use virtualization (e.g., react-window) and atomic state management (Zustand/Jotai) to render these streams at 60fps, ensuring the UI never lags behind the bot.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The "Recorder" Experience: You will refine our Chrome Extension overlay, ensuring it injects cleanly into any third-party website (using Shadow DOM encapsulation) to capture user intent without breaking the host page.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Tech Stack We run a modern, type-safe stack designed for velocity and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Frontend: React, TypeScript, Next.js&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Styling: Tailwind CSS (with Shadow DOM handling)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;State: Zustand / TanStack Query (for high-frequency updates)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Protocol: Model Context Protocol (MCP), WebSockets, Chrome Extension APIs&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Who You Are A React Expert (2+ Years): You understand the React reconciliation algorithm inside out. You know why useEffect is dangerous for high-frequency data and how to use useRef or useSyncExternalStore to optimize performance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;TypeScript Native: You don't just use any. You write robust, generic types that mirror complex backend schemas. You are comfortable sharing types between the extension background script and the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A "Craftsperson": You care about micro-interactions. You understand that trust is built through UI feedback—a loading spinner, a hover state, a smooth transition. You take pride in building developer tools that feel like magic.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Systems Thinker: You can reason about asynchronous systems. You understand race conditions, websocket reconnections, and the complexity of communicating between a Content Script, a Background Worker, and a React UI.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;High Agency: In a small YC team, nobody will hand you a ticket. You will identify problems, design solutions, and ship them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Why Join 100x.bot? Work on the Bleeding Edge. You will be a pioneer in the space of AI Agents.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;YC Culture: We move fast. We ship daily. We value product instincts over bureaucracy. You will have significant ownership and equity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Complex Engineering: You won't be bored. You are building a browser automation engine, a recording studio, and an IDE—all in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Work directly with Shardul and Parth to shape the product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How to Apply Email me your GitHub and a link to a complex UI you have built.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: We value actual build history over resumes/degress. Show us something that proves you are a craftsperson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Almost everyone has a household appliance at home, whether it's a washing machine, dishwasher, or dryer. Despite their ubiquity, little is publicly documented about how these devices actually work or how their internal components communicate. This talk takes a closer look at proprietary bus systems, hidden diagnostic interfaces, and approaches to cloud-less integration of appliances from two well-known manufacturers into modern home automation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern home appliances may seem simple from the outside, but inside they contain complex electronic systems, proprietary communication protocols, and diagnostic interfaces rarely documented outside the manufacturer. In this talk, we'll explore the challenges of reverse-engineering these systems: from analyzing appliance control boards and internal communication buses to decompiling and modifying firmware to better understand device functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll also look at the security mechanisms designed to protect diagnostic access and firmware readout, and how these protections can be bypassed to enable deeper insight into device operation. Finally, this talk will demonstrate how the results of this research can be used to integrate even legacy home appliances into popular home automation platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This session combines examples and insights from the reverse-engineering of B/S/H/ and Miele household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why You Need To Ditch VS Code To Be a Better Programmer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Categories: [Terminal], [Programming]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last Update: January 20, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VS Code is holding you back as a programmer. I know that's a bold statement, but hear me out. After spending years in the terminal then a year with VS Code and then moving to terminal-based development, I've seen firsthand how relying on GUI-based IDEs can limit your effectiveness as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Hidden Cost of Convenience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VS Code's biggest selling point is convenience. This is exactly what's hurting your development as a programmer. When you rely on VS Code to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manage your Git workflow&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Handle file operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auto-complete your code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Format your documents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run your tests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debug your applications&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're letting the IDE think for you instead of building a deep understanding of these fundamental operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Understanding Your Tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you work directly in the terminal, you're forced to understand what's actually happening when you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stage and commit changes in Git&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Navigate and manipulate your file system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build your tools to fit your exact needs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debug your code without visual breakpoints&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write code without constant auto-completion&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This deeper understanding makes you a more capable programmer because you know exactly what's happening under the hood. No more blindly accepting VS Code's suggestions or clicking buttons without understanding the underlying commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Real-World Impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's where this really matters: when things break. I've seen countless junior developers freeze when their IDE isn't available or when they need to work on a remote server. They know how to code in VS Code, but they don't know how to code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider these scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your production server needs an emergency hotfix&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You're SSH'd into a cloud instance that needs debugging&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You're working with a minimal Docker container&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to develop on a resource-constrained device&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these situations, your VS Code knowledge won't help you. But if you're comfortable with terminal-based development, you can work effectively anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Breaking Free from the GUI Crutch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue isn't just about terminal vs. GUI. It's about understanding vs. abstraction. Every time VS Code handles something for you, you miss an opportunity to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When VS Code formats your code, you don't learn your language's style conventions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When it handles Git conflicts, you don't learn proper merge strategies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When it manages your build process, you don't learn your build tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When it auto-imports modules, you don't learn your project's structure&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Path to Better Programming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how ditching VS Code makes you a better programmer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Deeper Understanding&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;You learn how your tools actually work&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;You understand the commands behind each operation&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;You see the direct relationship between input and output&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Better Problem Solving&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;No more relying on IDE error messages&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Forced to understand error outputs&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Development of debugging intuition&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Increased Flexibility&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Ability to work in any environment&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Not tied to specific IDE features&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Portable knowledge across platforms&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Improved Efficiency&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Faster text manipulation with vim motions&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Direct command execution without menu diving&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Reduced context switching&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real Growth Requires Discomfort&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, leaving VS Code will feel uncomfortable at first. Your productivity will temporarily drop. But this discomfort is the price of growth. Every time you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Look up a Git command instead of clicking a button&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Navigate files with terminal commands instead of a GUI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write code without constant auto-completion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debug using logs and terminal output&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're building real, transferable skills that make you a better programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Challenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not saying you need to uninstall VS Code today. Instead, I challenge you to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start using the terminal for Git operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learn basic vim motions for text editing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try debugging without breakpoints&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write code without relying on auto-completion&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give it a month. Push through the initial discomfort. I guarantee you'll come out a stronger, more capable programmer on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: VS Code isn't bad - it's just a crutch that's preventing you from developing crucial skills. The sooner you break free from that dependency, the sooner you'll grow into a more complete programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ready to take your programming skills to the next level? Open your terminal and start the journey today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy coding, J.R.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At Netflix, we are always exploring ways to make our content look and sound even better. To provide a common reference for prototyping bleeding-edge technologies within entertainment, technology and academic circles without compromising the security of our original and licensed programming, we've developed test titles oriented around documentary, live action, and animation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many open source assets are available from each project listed below. Our hope is this will encourage more experimentation, learning, and discovery that will benefit the whole industry. Many of these titles are also streaming on Netflix and are best enjoyed with any HDR configured device with your Premium subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can download single files directly through your web browser, but for large files and long frame sequences, you may wish to use command line tools. Guidance is included below. Ad Blockers may cause errors in your downloading process, so try turning it off if you have issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our open source content is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve had great success remastering titles like Knights of Sidonia, Flavours of Youth and Godzilla from SDR to HDR over the last few years. But what if we increase the resolution and create anime with HDR in mind from conception? Working with Japan's Production I.G, we set out to create the first 4K HDR Atmos anime short and discover what would need to change in anime workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read more about Sol Levante in the Netflix Tech Blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HDR10 2020 ST2084 UHD 24fps 1000nit&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DolbyVision PQ/P3 D65 UHD 24fps IMF&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atmos ADM and DAMF files&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ProTools Final Mix Session and Mastered Session&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4K HDR 16bit P3/PQ D65 Dolby Vision 2.9 XML + VDM&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Animatics, storyboard, selected After Effects projects, PSDs, and TGA in-betweens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A live action test piece, Nocturne was shot at 120fps and sought to investigate footage with spatially complex scenes that mimic other professionally generated content to challenge codecs on both the encoding and decoding sides. This piece was also mastered in Dolby Vision and Atmos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;120fps Video Display Master&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;60fps Video Display Master&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ADM WAV File&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon noticing the contrast in dark shadows against the bright sky and sparks from a welder working on a new Netflix building, the encoding team acquired a Sony PMW-F55 and the AXS-R5 RAW recorder to shoot 16-bit RAW SQ and produce Sparks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparks was shot 4K HFR and finished at 4000 nits using ACES. Read more about Sparks on the Netflix Tech Blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4K P3 PQ 4000nits Dolby Vision IMF&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HDR10 1000nit PQ 2020 image sequence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4K P3/PQ 4000nits EXR&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4K P3/PQ 4000nits EXR Dolby Vision metadata&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ACES 59.94fps image sequence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original Camera Files&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the industry shift from “more pixels” to “better pixels,” we produced Meridian, our first test title to tell a story. Meridian was mastered in Dolby Vision high dynamic range (HDR) with a P3-D65 color space and PQ (perceptual quantizer) transfer function. It also contained a Dolby Atmos mix, multiple language tracks, and subtitles. You can read more about Meridian on Variety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UHD IMF&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zipped UHD VDM&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UHD 4k 5994 HDR P3/PQ (mp4)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UHD VDM Image Sequence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dolby Atmos Metadata File&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atmos BWAV ADM&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TIFF Sequence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We felt a need to include animated content in our test title library, so we partnered with Blender Foundation and Fotokem’s Keep Me Posted to re-grade Cosmos Laundromat, an award-winning short film in Dolby Vision HDR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cosmos Laundromat is an Open Movie project created by Blender Studio and directed by Mathieu Auvray. The film was made entirely in Blender, an open source 3D content creation tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2k 24p HDR P3/PQ (mp4)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EXR to TIFF Nuke Script File&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EXR Sequence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chimera is technically comparable to El Fuente, but its scenes are more representative of existing titles on Netflix. The dinner scene attempts to recreate a codec-challenging sequence from House of Cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to Chimera, there wasn’t any open source 4K test material that exhibited real world live action material.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DCI 4k 2398p HDR P3/PQ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DCI 4k 5994p HDR P3/PQ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TIFF Sequence: DCI 4k 2398p&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TIFF Sequence: DCI 4k 5994p&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the demand for more pixels increased, so did appropriate test content. Documentary short El Fuente was shot in Mexico by a local DP at 4K at both 48 and 59.94 fps to meet increasing resolution and frame rate requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boat: 4096x2160 60fps 10bit 420 (YUV4Mpeg format)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FoodMarket: 4096x2160 60fps 10bit 420 (YUV4Mpeg format)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can download single files directly through your web browser on each page, but for large files and long frame sequences, you may wish to use command line tools such as aws cli. Instructions are posted on their website. After installation, you should be able to download the public assets. Try running these sample commands. If the download is interrupted, you can run the same command immediately and aws cli will resume the download where it left off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download a single file (0.7 kB):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usage: aws s3 cp --no-sign-request &amp;lt;s3 URI&amp;gt; &amp;lt;local destination&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example: aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://download.opencontent.netflix.com/TechblogAssets/Sparks/sparks_license.txt .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sync entire directory (1406.1 MB):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usage: aws s3 sync --no-sign-request &amp;lt;s3 URI&amp;gt; &amp;lt;local destination&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example: aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://download.opencontent.netflix.com/TechblogAssets/CosmosLaundromat/encodes/ .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The download links on this page will bring you to the root directory for that title's assets. You may need to navigate around to find the folder you want.&lt;/p&gt;
