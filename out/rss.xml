    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Writing code is easy. Once you have a solution in mind, and have mastered the syntax of your favorite programming language, writing code is easy. Having an LLM write entire functions for you? Even easier. But the hard part isn’t the writing. It’s the reading. It’s the time it takes to load the mental model of the system into your head. That’s where all the cost really is.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A mental model is the thing you build when you read code. It’s your internal map of how the system works, where the tricky parts are, what depends on what. Without it, you’re just staring at lines of text.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When I worked as a contractor, most of my jobs started the same way. I’d get a task to fix a bug or add a new feature in an application I’d never seen before. My mental model was clean and empty at first. To start filling it, I’d check the homepage to see what it looked like. I’d look at the page source: is this React? jQuery? A third-party plugin? I’d scan the codebase to see if the carousel they are requesting on the front page was used elsewhere. I’d check their build process, their testing setup, the tools they leaned on. Every little detail I discovered got appended to the model in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It was like moving into a new city. You start at the foot of your apartment, wander a few streets, notice which roads lead to the freeway, where the grocery store is, and slowly you start to orient yourself. That’s what reading code feels like: you’re building a mental map so you don’t get lost every time you move around.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Say you need to understand a simple function like &lt;code&gt;getUserPreferences(userId)&lt;/code&gt;. To build your mental model, you need to trace:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Where is this function defined?&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;What does it return? Is it a Promise? What's the shape of the data?&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Does it hit a database directly or go through an API?&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Are there caching layers involved?&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;What happens if the user doesn't exist?&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Who else calls this function and in what contexts?&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Are there side effects?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Understanding that one function means jumping between database schemas, API definitions, error handling middleware, and multiple call sites. Only after building this web of relationships do you have enough context to safely modify anything.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And it’s slow. Reading code is harder than writing it. Much harder. Writing code is forward motion: you’re laying down fresh pavement. Reading code means retracing someone else’s steps, which usually means jumping between files, chasing function calls, inferring side effects, and deciphering intentions that aren’t written down. Understanding one function often means looking at five other files. Only after all that do you have enough of a map to even begin.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s the same reason debugging is harder than coding. On Stack Overflow, one of the most common comments you’ll see under a bad question is: “Can you show us what you did?” Without seeing the steps, no one can load the right model in their head to help. It’s also why the XY problem keeps coming up. People ask about a symptom without giving the context that would let others reconstruct the whole picture.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm still fascinated by the lawyer who used ChatGPT in court. He filed a brief that cited six cases which turned out not to exist. Everyone asked: why didn’t he read them? The answer is the same: it takes time and effort to build the model. He would have had to chase down each case, read them, and slot them into a broader understanding of legal precedent. Reading is the hard part. Generating is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reading isn't just about going through the code and examining it line by line. It's also about going through the documentation, code reviews, and peer programming. In fact, these are solutions for accelerating the process of building our mental model. But with that in mind, you still have to, well, read and understand. You'll notice that programmers often want to rewrite things from scratch, because "the old code sucks". What sucks is taking the time to read and understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And this is what makes LLMs both powerful and dangerous in programming. Whether the AI generates perfect code or complete hallucinations, you still have to read it. You still have to trace through what it’s supposed to do, how it interacts with the rest of the system, and what the side effects are. The longer the generated code, the longer it takes to build your mental model. And only once you’ve done that can you spot the issues, the places where the generated code doesn’t quite fit, or quietly breaks something else.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When an LLM can produce an infinite amount of code or text, it tempts us to skip the reading. But you can’t skip the model. You wouldn’t want to load someone else’s saved game and be dropped in the middle of a boss fight. That’s what it feels like to inherit or generate code you don’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is why the real bottleneck in software development isn’t writing, it’s understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For now, we don't have the LLM equivalent for understanding. Something that could instantly transfer a complete mental model from the system to your head. Until we do, the bottleneck hasn't moved. We've solved the "typing speed" problem. We can generate more code than we could ever hope to read. But until we solve the "understanding" problem, the cost of software development remains the same: the time it takes for someone to make sense of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This has real implications for how we use AI tools. Instead of asking AI to generate large blocks of code, we might be better off asking it to help us understand existing code. Instead of measuring productivity by lines of code written, we should measure it by how quickly teams can build accurate mental models of their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The future of programming might not be about generating more code faster. It might be about generating understanding faster. And that's a much harder problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;ICEBlock handled my vulnerability report in the worst possible way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, I wrote about how Joshua Aaron's ICEBlock app, which allows people to anonymously report ICE sightings within a 5-mile radius, is – unfortunately, and despite apparent good intentions – activism theater. This was based on Joshua's talk at HOPE where he made it clear that he isn't taking the advice of local community groups, that ICE sightings aren't verified in any way, and that he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that post, in the section about his "HIGHLY secure" server that he kept mentioning, I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Without providing more details, I also discovered that his server is running outdated software with known vulnerabilities.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was intentionally vague because I knew that his server was vulnerable at the time of writing, and I didn't want anyone to exploit one of these vulnerabilities before he had a chance to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ICEBlock has been downloaded over one million times from the App Store. I don't know whether Joshua's server stores data related to these users or the reports they submit, but it might, and he certainly bragged about the security of it in his HOPE talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm publishing this because it's important for people who are trusting ICEBlock to know that the developer is careless about computer security, even when people specifically point out security issues and give him time to fix them. Hopefully his server doesn't have any user data. Hopefully no one will hack his server despite the fact that he's making it easy for them to. And hopefully this blog post will compel him to finally fix the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: It worked! Hours after I published this, Joshua has updated Apache in his server, fixing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joshua runs two Bluesky accounts: @iceblock.app, the account of the ICEBlock app, and @joshua.stealingheather.com, Joshua's personal account. His personal account had DMs closed, but the ICEBlock account had DMs open, so I sent him DMs there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 1, I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Hey Joshua, I'm one of the people who saw your HOPE talk and asked some of the questions. I'm giving you a heads up that I'm preparing to publish a blog post about the app and your talk that isn't very flattering. But also, I wanted to give you notice that you're running a vulnerable version of Apache on your linode server. I'm not mentioning this specifically, but you should install updates&lt;lb/&gt;You seem to be running Apache httpd 2.4.57. See https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html for more details, but this version of Apache has multiple critical CVEs which could take over your server. Like for example, this one https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38476&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, an hour and a half later, I published my blog and sent him my Bluesky post about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He didn't respond from the @iceblock.app account other than blocking me. (Which, honestly, isn't very fair, since I'm not ICE.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He did, however, send me a DM from his @joshua.stealingheather.com account, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;It would be so great if you could stop lying about me and ICEBlock. You are doing nothing to help. You don’t know me, my history, my knowledge, or anything more than hearing me at Hope.&lt;lb/&gt;Don’t bother responding because this will be my last and only communication with you. Do better.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To which I replied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;If I got anything wrong in my blog post, please let me know and I’d be happy to post a correction&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a screenshot of the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days later, on September 3, I decided to check again. His server was still running Apache 2.4.57, which has multiple vulnerabilities. He ignored my report and didn't fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And just so you know, fixing this problem is extremely easy. He just needs to SSH in and run something like &lt;code&gt;sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade&lt;/code&gt;, wait for the Apache updated package to install, and his server would no longer be vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeing that he wasn't taking this seriously, I decided to give him a deadline to patch his server before I publicly disclosed the vulnerability. I sent his @joshua.stealingheather.com account these messages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Hey Joshua, I noticed that you still haven't updated Apache on your server. I disclosed that you're running Apache 2.4.57, which has known critical vulnerabilities, on September 1. I don't know what data (if any) related to [ICEBlock] and its users that you store on your server. But until you update Apache, it might be trivial for anyone to hack your server and steal all of it. So, please install updates.&lt;lb/&gt;I'm giving you a week from when I first disclosed this before I write about it (so, September 8), which should give you more than enough time to update a package.&lt;lb/&gt;Just so you're aware, I determined the version of Apache using nmap's version detection feature. You can run&lt;code&gt;nmap -p443 -sV iceblock.app&lt;/code&gt;to test the version yourself, and it should show you this:&lt;lb/&gt;PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION&lt;lb/&gt;443/tcp open ssl/http Apache httpd 2.4.57 ((Unix) OpenSSL/3.0.9)&lt;lb/&gt;As a reminder, you can find the known vulnerabilities for this version of Apache here: https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html&lt;lb/&gt;And, as I showed you before, just one of the vulns is CVE-2024-38476, which you can read about here: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38476. This is a "critical" vulnerability that could potentially be used to execute scripts on your server. Please get back to me.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He didn't get back to me. And an hour and a half later, he blocked me from this account too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's now been a week, and I checked again: Joshua's "HIGHLY secure" server is still running a version of Apache with multiple known critical vulnerabilities. And even with plenty of time to fix the issue, he still hasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope he isn't storing any ICEBlock-related data on there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Experimenting with local LLMs on macOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;September 08, 2025 · 9 minutes to read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, this blog post will be about LLMs, and everyone has opinions about that. To be upfront about it, I’m a skeptic (bordering on hater), yet I like experimenting with stuff so I download and run them locally on my Mac. And I’ll teach you how to do it too, if you’d like!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some call them fancy autocomplete, some argue that they are sentient and should have rights. The truth is somewhere in between. Yes, they perform next word prediction, but it’s so complex that there’s nontrivial emergent behavior. No, they don’t have creativity or a mind. I believe one day we can create sentient machines, but not in this current iteration, maybe not before we go extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we’re out of the science fiction territory, let’s talk about their strengths. Laurie has a great post about it, which I highly recommend, but in summary they are generally good at summarizing text, regurgitating home maintenance advice from reddit, or telling you that you have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also use them for brain-dumping. I find it hard to keep a journal, because I find it boring, but when you’re pretending to be writing to someone, it’s easier. If you have friends, that’s much better, but some topics are too personal and a friend may not be available at 4 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mostly ignore its responses, because it’s for me to unload, not to listen to a machine spew slop. I suggest you do the same, because we’re anthropomorphization machines and I’d rather not experience AI psychosis. It’s better if you don’t give it a chance to convince you it’s real. I could use a system prompt so it doesn’t follow up with dumb questions (or “YoU’Re AbSoLuTeLy CoRrEcT”s), but I never bothered as I already don’t read it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I’m interested in them because it’s tech and I like tech. I don’t believe they make you that much productive, and I never let them write for me. When I ask it something, I always fact-check, they are known to hallucinate (or bullshit, if you prefer) and I’ve experienced this too many times to trust it. Most importantly, just avoid asking questions that can’t be easily verified, there’s enough fake news around anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may be asking, “Well I can do everything you said with ChatGPT free tier, why bother running them locally?” There are a few reasons, and I’ve already mentioned them briefly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I like experimenting with things. It’s marvelous that you can download this 12 GB file and your computer talks to you marginally better than ELIZA! Joking aside, we accepted the concept of LLMs too quickly, when the truth is that we never expected computers to figure out human speech before robots were walking among us. So it feels a bit magical when my computer has better grammar than I do, and I can summon one whenever I want without a supercomputer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;People have secrets and some secrets shouldn’t leave your computer. Companies are not well equipped to keep your sensitive data, and current trends show that they can retain your data or use it for training. I feel like a local LLM is a better choice for these use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I don’t feel comfortable giving money to the AI companies. Every single one of them has done some kind of unethical thing, and the way the AI race is going, a hypothetical ethical one will be left behind. They intentionally hype AI, destroy the environment, and plagiarize people’s hard work. I’m thankful for the open-weight models they provide and will keep using them, luckily they can’t take that away from me.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you still want to run an LLM on your macOS1, let’s get started. There are two options that I recommend, one is open-source and the other is easier to use, as all things are. I only cover macOS because that’s what I have; if that’s not your platform, you can still follow this guide with platform-specific tweaks, or find another guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Llama.cpp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s created by Georgi Gerganov and works really well with a ton of configuration options. It supports a lot of platforms, can download models, and has a basic web UI for convenience. You can install it with Nix using the following command: &lt;code&gt;nix profile install nixpkgs#llama-cpp&lt;/code&gt;. For other installation methods, check their instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To download and run a small and good enough model for experimentation, I recommend Gemma 3 4B QAT, which you can do with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ llama-server -hf ggml-org/gemma-3-4b-it-qat-GGUF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you open your web browser and navigate to &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8080&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll see a very bare bones web UI that’s eerily similar to ChatGPT, but that should be enough. You can experiment with it and exit the server once you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;LM Studio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the closed-source but easier to use one. It has a superb UI that lets you browse models, manage downloads, organize chats, and even tells you if a model can run on your machine. It has guardrails so you don’t crash your system by loading a model that’s too large. I like using it a lot, but enshittification is always a risk with closed-source for-profit software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can download a DMG from its website and install it as usual. LM Studio has two runtimes on macOS, &lt;code&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/code&gt; which we covered earlier, and MLX, which is an ML engine developed by Apple and runs a bit faster, but offers less configuration in the UI. (I didn’t try running MLX directly, maybe it’s configurable but not exposed.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not provide a walkthrough because this is not a product tour and the UI is pretty user-friendly anyway. I can give you some tips and tricks though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can switch the model mid-conversation, it won’t have any problem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can branch off the current conversation, which is good for experimentation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can regenerate the assistant message, like ChatGPT&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can edit your own messages, also like ChatGPT, but you can also edit assistant messages, which allows you to put words into its mouth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can create presets for system prompts and reuse them for different personas&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are a lot of model settings you can configure; for example, you can customize the context overflow behavior when the context grows larger than the context window (the default is to truncate the middle, so first and last messages are kept, which is a good default)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to choose a good LLM for your use case&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now there are a lot of open-weight models around, almost all AI companies have released one. There are a few things you need to pay attention to when choosing a model. These things take a lot of disk space so be mindful of filling your disk!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Model size&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have plenty of free space on your drive, but for the LLM to work you need to load it into memory. So your RAM is the bottleneck. Since the operating system also needs memory to work, if you have 16 GB RAM, like me, then models should be less than 12 GB. Loading larger models may cause you to run out of memory, your system will be unresponsive, and you’ll have to perform a hard reboot. Larger models will also run slower.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Runtime&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re using &lt;code&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/code&gt; directly, or as the runtime in LM Studio, you need GGUF models. If you’re using the MLX runtime in LM Studio, you need MLX models. As mentioned before, MLX models run slightly faster, but GGUF models provide more configuration, and since they can run on many platforms they are ubiquitous and better tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Quantization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most LLMs are trained at 16-bit precision, but you can downcast (or quantize) the weights to lower precision and they still perform well up to some point. The sweet point is around 4 bits, which is noted as &lt;code&gt;Q4&lt;/code&gt;. LM Studio defaults to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantization is a rabbit hole; different kernels are used for quantization, which is included in the notation, such as &lt;code&gt;Q4_K_M&lt;/code&gt;, which is a bit too much for me and I decided against learning it. Just download the default and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Vision models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some models can tokenize image inputs and can “see” what’s inside them. This feels pretty magical; they can read text, recognize objects, and determine the mood or art style. You can use them as basic OCRs but in my experience dedicated OCRs perform better at serious tasks, LLMs tend to make shit up when they can’t read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reasoning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some models can “think” before generating an answer, which is sometimes called “inference time scaling”3. The general wisdom is that smaller reasoning models can compete with larger non-reasoning models, which is reflected in benchmarks. The downside is that it takes longer to get an answer. So you need to decide if you want a larger but smarter model, or a smaller one that reasons. Keep in mind that reasoning sometimes takes minutes, and fills up the context pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tool use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some models are taught to emit special tokens that can call tools specified in the system prompt with the correct arguments. LM Studio has a UI for adding MCP servers and managing the capabilities provided by them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, LM Studio asks you to confirm each tool call request, which is great for security. Tool calls are commonly used for data exfiltration attacks, which is as bad as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LM Studio by default comes with a JavaScript MCP, powered by Deno, which provides the LLM the ability to execute code in a sandbox. This is really powerful, you can make it perform hard calculations, analyze data, even generate random numbers. I created a number guessing game, which works better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also plug in a web search MCP to give it up-to-date knowledge retrieval capabilities. Since small models have limited world knowledge, this makes them work remarkably well for applicable use cases. I have used Exa’s free tier for this, which worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you want a model to have long-term memory, there are a ton of MCPs that can do that. But keeping with the theme of keeping things local, I found MCP server for Obsidian to be a good candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind regarding MCPs is that since they have to teach the model about themselves, they pollute the context pretty quickly, so be sure to only enable those you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Aside: Agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Agents are models using tools in a loop.” So a model that has both reasoning and tool use capabilities hits a sweet spot, and is commonly called an “agent”. These can call tools repeatedly while reasoning, and provide a complete answer. The truth is far from perfect, in my experience, but it’s still a cool concept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Finding a good model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LM Studio has a built-in UI for finding models, which shows runtime, quantization, model capabilities, and size in a user-friendly way. For &lt;code&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/code&gt;, you can check Hugging Face for GGUF models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may not find a model that hits all the capability boxes, so it’s better to download a variety of models and experiment with them. Here are some of my favorites, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gemma 3 12B QAT: for visual intelligence and it’s generally a good non-reasoning model that’s fast and produces good text&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Qwen3 4B 2507 Thinking: This is the updated version of Qwen3 4B, which also has a non-reasoning variant; it’s really small, fast, and good quality for its size&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPT-OSS 20B: The largest and most capable model that can run on my machine, has three levels of reasoning; it’s rather slow but very capable, smartest of all&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Phi-4 (14B): It was my favorite before GPT-OSS, now has reasoning and reasoning plus variants, but I haven’t used it lately&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small models may not replace frontier models in terms of speed or quality, but I still see utility in them. Running them locally is also a good test bed for understanding how they work and learning to work around their weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me part with a final tip: LM Studio shows you how much of the context window is being used. So you may find it useful to ask for it to summarize the conversation so far, when the context window gets close to being filled. This way you can help it remember important information that it would otherwise forget.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have fun with your brand new genie in your computer!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Jull for reviewing an early draft, and my girlfriend for the leekspin hero image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With an M-series, Apple Silicon chipset, Intel chips are pretty old at this point and wouldn’t run LLMs well↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You may be wondering about performance and if it will be usable. When you generate a model response, two things happen in sequence; prompt processing and token generation. Prompt processing is tokenizing the entire chat history, is done in parallel, and compute bound. Token generation is sequential, and is memory bandwidth bound. Both of these things get slower as the context size increases. &lt;lb/&gt;Also, counterintuitively, these models don’t run on the Neural Engine. Both&lt;code&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/code&gt;and MLX run on the GPU, using Metal shaders. I’m not entirely sure why though.↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s called that because the common wisdom is that models reason with tokens, and a smaller model can generate a higher quality response if it generates more tokens. To protect the user from the burden of reading through more slop, these reasoning tokens are usually hidden from the user.↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is called compaction and, coding tools such as Claude Code can do this automatically, or provide a command for you to trigger it manually.↩&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Experimenting with local LLMs on macOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;September 08, 2025 · 9 minutes to read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, this blog post will be about LLMs, and everyone has opinions about that. To be upfront about it, I’m a skeptic (bordering on hater), yet I like experimenting with stuff so I download and run them locally on my Mac. And I’ll teach you how to do it too, if you’d like!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some call them fancy autocomplete, some argue that they are sentient and should have rights. The truth is somewhere in between. Yes, they perform next word prediction, but it’s so complex that there’s nontrivial emergent behavior. No, they don’t have creativity or a mind. I believe one day we can create sentient machines, but not in this current iteration, maybe not before we go extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we’re out of the science fiction territory, let’s talk about their strengths. Laurie has a great post about it, which I highly recommend, but in summary they are generally good at summarizing text, regurgitating home maintenance advice from reddit, or telling you that you have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also use them for brain-dumping. I find it hard to keep a journal, because I find it boring, but when you’re pretending to be writing to someone, it’s easier. If you have friends, that’s much better, but some topics are too personal and a friend may not be available at 4 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mostly ignore its responses, because it’s for me to unload, not to listen to a machine spew slop. I suggest you do the same, because we’re anthropomorphization machines and I’d rather not experience AI psychosis. It’s better if you don’t give it a chance to convince you it’s real. I could use a system prompt so it doesn’t follow up with dumb questions (or “YoU’Re AbSoLuTeLy CoRrEcT”s), but I never bothered as I already don’t read it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I’m interested in them because it’s tech and I like tech. I don’t believe they make you that much productive, and I never let them write for me. When I ask it something, I always fact-check, they are known to hallucinate (or bullshit, if you prefer) and I’ve experienced this too many times to trust it. Most importantly, just avoid asking questions that can’t be easily verified, there’s enough fake news around anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may be asking, “Well I can do everything you said with ChatGPT free tier, why bother running them locally?” There are a few reasons, and I’ve already mentioned them briefly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I like experimenting with things. It’s marvelous that you can download this 12 GB file and your computer talks to you marginally better than ELIZA! Joking aside, we accepted the concept of LLMs too quickly, when the truth is that we never expected computers to figure out human speech before robots were walking among us. So it feels a bit magical when my computer has better grammar than I do, and I can summon one whenever I want without a supercomputer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;People have secrets and some secrets shouldn’t leave your computer. Companies are not well equipped to keep your sensitive data, and current trends show that they can retain your data or use it for training. I feel like a local LLM is a better choice for these use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I don’t feel comfortable giving money to the AI companies. Every single one of them has done some kind of unethical thing, and the way the AI race is going, a hypothetical ethical one will be left behind. They intentionally hype AI, destroy the environment, and plagiarize people’s hard work. I’m thankful for the open-weight models they provide and will keep using them, luckily they can’t take that away from me.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you still want to run an LLM on your macOS1, let’s get started. There are two options that I recommend, one is open-source and the other is easier to use, as all things are. I only cover macOS because that’s what I have; if that’s not your platform, you can still follow this guide with platform-specific tweaks, or find another guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Llama.cpp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s created by Georgi Gerganov and works really well with a ton of configuration options. It supports a lot of platforms, can download models, and has a basic web UI for convenience. You can install it with Nix using the following command: &lt;code&gt;nix profile install nixpkgs#llama-cpp&lt;/code&gt;. For other installation methods, check their instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To download and run a small and good enough model for experimentation, I recommend Gemma 3 4B QAT, which you can do with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ llama-server -hf ggml-org/gemma-3-4b-it-qat-GGUF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you open your web browser and navigate to &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8080&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll see a very bare bones web UI that’s eerily similar to ChatGPT, but that should be enough. You can experiment with it and exit the server once you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;LM Studio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the closed-source but easier to use one. It has a superb UI that lets you browse models, manage downloads, organize chats, and even tells you if a model can run on your machine. It has guardrails so you don’t crash your system by loading a model that’s too large. I like using it a lot, but enshittification is always a risk with closed-source for-profit software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can download a DMG from its website and install it as usual. LM Studio has two runtimes on macOS, &lt;code&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/code&gt; which we covered earlier, and MLX, which is an ML engine developed by Apple and runs a bit faster, but offers less configuration in the UI. (I didn’t try running MLX directly, maybe it’s configurable but not exposed.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not provide a walkthrough because this is not a product tour and the UI is pretty user-friendly anyway. I can give you some tips and tricks though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can switch the model mid-conversation, it won’t have any problem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can branch off the current conversation, which is good for experimentation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can regenerate the assistant message, like ChatGPT&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can edit your own messages, also like ChatGPT, but you can also edit assistant messages, which allows you to put words into its mouth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can create presets for system prompts and reuse them for different personas&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are a lot of model settings you can configure; for example, you can customize the context overflow behavior when the context grows larger than the context window (the default is to truncate the middle, so first and last messages are kept, which is a good default)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to choose a good LLM for your use case&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now there are a lot of open-weight models around, almost all AI companies have released one. There are a few things you need to pay attention to when choosing a model. These things take a lot of disk space so be mindful of filling your disk!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Model size&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have plenty of free space on your drive, but for the LLM to work you need to load it into memory. So your RAM is the bottleneck. Since the operating system also needs memory to work, if you have 16 GB RAM, like me, then models should be less than 12 GB. Loading larger models may cause you to run out of memory, your system will be unresponsive, and you’ll have to perform a hard reboot. Larger models will also run slower.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Runtime&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re using &lt;code&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/code&gt; directly, or as the runtime in LM Studio, you need GGUF models. If you’re using the MLX runtime in LM Studio, you need MLX models. As mentioned before, MLX models run slightly faster, but GGUF models provide more configuration, and since they can run on many platforms they are ubiquitous and better tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Quantization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most LLMs are trained at 16-bit precision, but you can downcast (or quantize) the weights to lower precision and they still perform well up to some point. The sweet point is around 4 bits, which is noted as &lt;code&gt;Q4&lt;/code&gt;. LM Studio defaults to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantization is a rabbit hole; different kernels are used for quantization, which is included in the notation, such as &lt;code&gt;Q4_K_M&lt;/code&gt;, which is a bit too much for me and I decided against learning it. Just download the default and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Vision models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some models can tokenize image inputs and can “see” what’s inside them. This feels pretty magical; they can read text, recognize objects, and determine the mood or art style. You can use them as basic OCRs but in my experience dedicated OCRs perform better at serious tasks, LLMs tend to make shit up when they can’t read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reasoning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some models can “think” before generating an answer, which is sometimes called “inference time scaling”3. The general wisdom is that smaller reasoning models can compete with larger non-reasoning models, which is reflected in benchmarks. The downside is that it takes longer to get an answer. So you need to decide if you want a larger but smarter model, or a smaller one that reasons. Keep in mind that reasoning sometimes takes minutes, and fills up the context pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tool use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some models are taught to emit special tokens that can call tools specified in the system prompt with the correct arguments. LM Studio has a UI for adding MCP servers and managing the capabilities provided by them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, LM Studio asks you to confirm each tool call request, which is great for security. Tool calls are commonly used for data exfiltration attacks, which is as bad as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LM Studio by default comes with a JavaScript MCP, powered by Deno, which provides the LLM the ability to execute code in a sandbox. This is really powerful, you can make it perform hard calculations, analyze data, even generate random numbers. I created a number guessing game, which works better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also plug in a web search MCP to give it up-to-date knowledge retrieval capabilities. Since small models have limited world knowledge, this makes them work remarkably well for applicable use cases. I have used Exa’s free tier for this, which worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you want a model to have long-term memory, there are a ton of MCPs that can do that. But keeping with the theme of keeping things local, I found MCP server for Obsidian to be a good candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind regarding MCPs is that since they have to teach the model about themselves, they pollute the context pretty quickly, so be sure to only enable those you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Aside: Agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Agents are models using tools in a loop.” So a model that has both reasoning and tool use capabilities hits a sweet spot, and is commonly called an “agent”. These can call tools repeatedly while reasoning, and provide a complete answer. The truth is far from perfect, in my experience, but it’s still a cool concept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Finding a good model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LM Studio has a built-in UI for finding models, which shows runtime, quantization, model capabilities, and size in a user-friendly way. For &lt;code&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/code&gt;, you can check Hugging Face for GGUF models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may not find a model that hits all the capability boxes, so it’s better to download a variety of models and experiment with them. Here are some of my favorites, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Will Amazon S3 Vectors Kill Vector Databases—or Save Them?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, AWS dropped something new: S3 Vectors. It’s their first attempt at a vector storage solution, letting you store and query vector embeddings for semantic search right inside Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a glance, it looks like a lightweight vector database running on top of low-cost object storage—at a price point that is clearly attractive compared to many dedicated vector database solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;amazon s3 vectors.png&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this sparked a lot of hot takes. I’ve seen folks on social media and in engineering circles say this could be the end of purpose-built vector databases—Milvus, Pinecone, Qdrant, and others included. Bold claim, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the engineering architect of Milvus and someone who’s spent way too many late nights thinking about vector search, I have to admit that: S3 Vectors does bring something interesting to the table, especially around cost and integration within the AWS ecosystem. But instead of “killing” vector databases, I see it fitting into the ecosystem as a complementary piece. In fact, its real future probably lies in working with professional vector databases, not replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll walk you through why I think that—looking at it from three angles: the tech itself, what it can and can’t do, and what it means for the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Surprising Fact: Vector Storage Can Cost More Than LLM Calls&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vector search is powerful, but it comes with a serious catch: it’s expensive. The computational demands are often one to two orders of magnitude higher than what you’d see in a typical NoSQL database. That gap isn’t just theoretical—it shows up in real bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke with the CTO of a popular AI note-taking app who told me something surprising: they spend twice as much on vector search as they do on OpenAI API calls. Think about that for a second. Running the retrieval layer costs them more than paying for the LLM itself. That flips the usual assumption on its head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 ChatGPT boom only made this more obvious. Suddenly, embeddings were everywhere, and vector data became the fastest-growing data type on the public cloud. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was the driver—and with it came three challenges that reshaped what a vector database like Milvus had to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massive data explosion: Workloads jumped from tens of millions to tens of billions of vectors almost overnight. That’s not linear growth—it’s a quantum leap, and it broke the old ways of handling data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latency tolerance shifted: Since LLMs take time to generate responses anyway, users became more forgiving of slightly slower retrieval. The “sub-10ms recall at all costs” mindset suddenly mattered less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost sensitivity skyrocketed: Doubling or tripling data volume wasn’t just a storage problem; it became a financial crisis if you tried to scale using traditional compute-heavy designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short: vector databases had to evolve fast, not because the technology didn’t work, but because the economics of retrieval were suddenly front and center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Evolution of Vector Storage: From Memory to Disk, and Now to Object Storage&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressure around cost and scale forced one conclusion: vector databases couldn’t stay memory-only forever. They had to evolve—first to disk, and now to object storage like S3. This wasn’t a choice; it was an industry inevitability. And if you’ve been following the space, you’ve probably noticed the same trend I have over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen vector databases go through three distinct stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase I (2018–2022): The Pure Memory Era: In the early Milvus days, we leaned on memory indexes like HNSW and IVF. The performance and recall were fantastic—but the costs were brutal. Memory doesn’t scale cheaply, and everyone paying those cloud bills knew it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase II (2022–2024): The Disk Index Revolution: To break the memory bottleneck, we pioneered a disk-based approach using DiskANN along with our proprietary Cardinal index (exclusive to Zilliz Cloud, the managed Milvus). With tricks like asynchronous I/O (AIO) and io_uring, we managed to squeeze real performance out of disks. The result? A 3–5x cost reduction. Our capacity-optimized compute units (CUs) quickly became bestsellers in Zilliz Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase III (2024– ): The Tiered Storage Era: The next step was obvious: push vector indexes onto cheap object storage. New players like TurboPuffer went all-in on S3, dropping storage costs to ~$0.33/GB/month—a 10x reduction. But the trade-off was just as clear: cold query latency in the 500ms–1s range, and weaker recall precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Zilliz, we’ve been working on tiered storage for a while, but we held back release until we could tame cold query performance. Next month, we’ll be rolling out our upgraded extended-capacity CUs with true hot/cold separation in Zilliz Cloud. That means stable cold query latency under 500ms, paired with ultra-high QPS for hot queries. In other words, the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Amazon S3 Vectors Arrives Right on Cue&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;With tiered storage already proving itself, it’s no surprise that AWS jumped in with S3 Vectors. In fact, the release feels like a natural extension of what was already happening across the industry. Amazon had been expanding S3’s role with features like S3 Tables, evolving it from “just object storage” into a multi-modal cold storage backbone. Vectors are simply the next modality in that evolution—and it probably won’t stop there. Graphs, key-value, and time series data could all follow the same path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Amazon brings three undeniable advantages to the table:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower cost: among the lowest storage pricing in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massive scale: AWS’s machine pools can absorb almost any query load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microservice-native architecture: perfectly aligned with vector indexing’s write–build–query workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put together, these give S3 Vectors the makings of an ultra-low-cost, highly scalable cold storage solution for vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;S3 Vectors is A True Price Killer, But With Clear Limits&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as S3 Vectors was announced, our team put it through comprehensive tests. The results were eye-opening—not just in terms of how cheap it is, but also where the cracks start to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;S3 Vectors is A True Price Killer&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying it: S3 Vectors is incredibly cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storage runs at just $0.06/GB, roughly 5 times cheaper than most serverless vector solutions. For a representative workload—say 400 million vectors plus 10 million queries per month—the bill comes out to about $1,217/month. That’s more than a 10x reduction compared to traditional vector databases. For low-QPS, latency-tolerant workloads, it’s almost unbeatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But Performance Has Real Constraints&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection size limits: Each S3 table maxes out at 50M vectors, and you can only create up to 10,000 tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold queries: Latency comes in at ~500ms for 1M vectors and ~700ms for 10M vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot queries: Latency stays under 200ms at 200 QPS, but pushing beyond that 200 QPS ceiling is tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write performance: Capped at under 2MB/s. That’s orders of magnitude lower than Milvus (which handles GB/s), though to its credit, writes don’t degrade query performance. Translation: it’s not designed for scenarios with large, frequently changing datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Precision and Functionality Trade-Offs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precision story is where things get tricky. Recall hovers at 85–90%, and you don’t get knobs to tune it higher. Layer on filters, and recall can drop below 50%. In one test where we deleted 50% of data, TopK queries asked for 20 results but could only return 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functionality is also pared down. TopK queries max out at 30. Metadata per record has strict size limits. And you won’t find features like hybrid search, multi-tenancy, or advanced filtering—all of which are must-haves for many production applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dissecting S3 Vectors: The Likely Architecture&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After running tests and mapping them against familiar AWS design patterns, we’ve formed a pretty good hypothesis of how S3 Vectors works under the hood. While Amazon hasn’t published full details, the performance characteristics point to five core technologies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPFresh Dynamic Indexing: Instead of rebuilding entire indexes after each write, S3 Vectors seems to update only the affected portions. This design keeps write costs low and availability high, but it comes at a price: recall rates slip by a few percentage points after updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep Quantization (4-bit PQ): To cut down on S3’s I/O overhead, embeddings are likely compressed using 4-bit product quantization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upside: storage is cheap, and queries stay fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downside: recall flatlines around ~85%, and there are no knobs for developers to tune it higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-Filter Mechanism: Filtering looks to be applied after coarse retrieval. That keeps the index unified and simple, but it struggles with complex conditions. In our tests, when we deleted 50% of data, TopK queries requesting 20 results returned only 15—classic signs of a post-filter pipeline. This also suggests Amazon leaned heavily on existing open-source index designs rather than building a custom one from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-Tier Caching: Hot queries behave much faster, likely thanks to an SSD/NVMe cache sitting in front of S3. But when a query misses the cache, latency jumps significantly. That pattern fits a multi-tier cache hierarchy built to mask object storage’s inherent slowness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large-Scale Distributed Scheduling: AWS has no shortage of machine pools. S3 Vectors appears to spread the workload across microservices, pipelining the read → decompress → search flow. The result is what we observed in tests: a remarkably stable latency distribution, even under heavy load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where S3 Vectors Fits: The Right Tool for Specific Jobs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After putting S3 Vectors through its paces, it’s clear that it shines in some scenarios and falls short in others. Like most infrastructure tools, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution—it’s the right tool for the right job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Where It Works Well&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold data archiving: Perfect for storing history datasets that are rarely accessed. If you can live with 500ms+ query times, the cost savings are unbeatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-QPS RAG queries: Think of small internal tools or chatbots that run only dozens of queries per day, staying under 100 QPS. For these use cases, latency isn’t a dealbreaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-cost prototyping: Great for proof-of-concept projects where the goal is to test an idea without spending heavily on infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Where It Struggles&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-performance search and recommendation: If your application needs sub-50ms latency, S3 Vectors simply isn’t built for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-volume writes or frequent updates: Performance degrades quickly, and recall precision drops noticeably under heavy churn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex query workloads: There’s no support for hybrid search, aggregations, or other advanced querying features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-tenant production apps: With a hard cap of 10,000 buckets, it’s not designed for large-scale multi-tenant deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, S3 Vectors is excellent for cold, cheap, low-QPS scenarios—but it’s not the engine you want to power a recommendation system, a real-time search app, or any high-scale production system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Future is Tiered Vector Storage&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;S3 Vectors doesn’t spell the end of vector databases—it confirms something many of us have been seeing for a while: the future is tiered storage. Instead of keeping every vector in expensive memory or fast disk, workloads will naturally spread across hot, warm, and cold tiers based on how often it’s accessed and what kind of latency the application can tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what that looks like in practice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot Data Layer (&amp;lt;50ms) – This is where real-time search, recommendations, and targeted ads live. Latency needs to be under 50ms, which means specialized vector databases are still the best option. They’re optimized for both blazing speed and high query throughput.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warm Data Layer (50–500ms) – Many RAG-based applications and multi-tenant shared services fall here. These workloads don’t need ultra-low latency, but they do need predictable performance at lower cost. S3 Vectors and Milvus’s tiered storage instances fit this middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold Data Layer (&amp;gt;500ms) – Historical archives and offline analysis don’t require real-time responses, so latency in the hundreds of milliseconds is acceptable. What matters here is cost efficiency at massive scale. This is where solutions like S3 + Spark/Daft or the Milvus vector data lake shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hot–warm–cold split balances latency, cost, and scale in a way that no single storage tier can cover on its own. It’s a pattern we’ve seen before in relational databases, data warehouses, and even CDNs—and vector storage is now following the same trajectory. This three-tier architecture also lines up closely with the roadmap we’ve been building for Milvus and Zilliz Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. A Unified Online + Offline Processing Architecture&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI applications don’t live neatly in separate “online” and “offline” worlds. In reality, data moves constantly between the two. That’s why with the upcoming Milvus 3.0, we will introduce a vector data lake, designed to support both real-time retrieval and offline processing from the same dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means one dataset can power your live RAG and search queries, while also feeding into Spark-based offline analysis—for example, curating training data for LLMs. No duplication, no juggling two different pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also roll out the StorageV2 format for the vector data lake, which takes the economics to another level:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 100x cheaper for cold data storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 100x faster than brute-force Spark queries on hot data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a unified system that minimizes redundancy, keeps costs under control, and makes working with vector data a lot less painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Building Features AI Developers Actually Need&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, AI applications have been moving fast—and so have the requirements for the infrastructure behind them. At Zilliz, we’ve pushed Milvus forward in step with those needs, shipping capabilities like BM25 + vector hybrid search, multi-tenant isolation, hot–cold tiered storage, and MinHash deduplication, along with a long list of developer-focused improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our philosophy has been simple: when you combine deep understanding of business use cases with the latest technology, you unlock entirely new infrastructure possibilities. That’s the mindset shaping Milvus 3.0, which will bring a new wave of AI-native features designed directly for real-world applications. Among them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyword weighting in search – So a query like “red phone” can prioritize red appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geolocation support – Store and query location-aware vectors to handle prompts like “find nearby coffee shops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-vector support for RAG – Attach multiple embeddings to each text, improving recall and accuracy in complex retrieval tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexible UDF processing – User-defined functions for richer, customizable data processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual analytics tools – Deeper offline mining and data exploration at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s just the start. The bigger point is that Milvus is evolving into a system that’s not only efficient and scalable, but AI-native at its core—purpose-built for how modern applications actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Engineering for Scale Without the Price Tag&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Zilliz, we believe that: a 10x cost reduction opens the door to 100x more application use cases. That principle has guided every big milestone in Milvus. Since 2022, we’ve introduced disk-based indexes, GPU acceleration, and RabitQ quantization—all of which have pushed query performance up by orders of magnitude while driving costs down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, our focus is on squeezing even more efficiency out of the stack:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deeper hardware optimization – Tuning for raw compute power and IOPS performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smarter compression and quantization – Making vectors lighter without giving up accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early termination for index queries – Cutting off wasted computation as soon as we have confident results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined tiered indexing – Better cache utilization for faster access to cold data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end goal hasn’t changed: build infrastructure that just works out of the box, scales on demand, and stays both fast and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why the Advent of S3 Vectors Is Good News for Everyone&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people worry that S3 Vectors will make traditional vector databases obsolete. My take is the opposite: its release is good news for the entire industry. In fact, I see three big benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It validates demand. No one can claim vectors are just a fad anymore. If AWS is building a product around it, that’s proof positive that vector storage is a real necessity—not just “indexes wrapped in a database.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It educates the market. With AWS’s reach, more enterprises are now aware of vector databases, which expands the boundaries of what applications can be built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It drives innovation. Competition pushes all of us—Milvus included—to optimize harder, cut costs further, and find differentiated strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a positioning standpoint, S3 Vectors looks less like a complete vector database and more like the cold tier of vector storage. Its low cost makes it especially attractive for scenarios that were previously priced out: small teams building RAG apps, individual developers experimenting, or organizations indexing massive datasets with only basic retrieval needs. That’s a real unlock for the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I also want to acknowledge the AWS engineering team. They’ve been steadily improving their platform—from Lambda debugging to cold start performance—and S3 Vectors is another example of thoughtful product innovation. I’m genuinely curious to see what developers will build now that the economics are this favorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So no, the vector database market isn’t being disrupted—it’s maturing into a tiered ecosystem where different solutions serve different performance and cost needs. That’s good for enterprises, good for developers, and good for the overall AI infrastructure stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The golden age of vector databases isn’t over—it’s just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;A Surprising Fact: Vector Storage Can Cost More Than LLM Calls&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Evolution of Vector Storage: From Memory to Disk, and Now to Object Storage&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Amazon S3 Vectors Arrives Right on Cue&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;S3 Vectors is A True Price Killer, But With Clear Limits&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Dissecting S3 Vectors: The Likely Architecture&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Where S3 Vectors Fits: The Right Tool for Specific Jobs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Future is Tiered Vector Storage&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Why the Advent of S3 Vectors Is Good News for Everyone&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Content&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Start Free, Scale Easily&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try the fully-managed vector database built for your GenAI applications.&lt;/p&gt;Try Zilliz Cloud for Free&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Keep Reading&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Similarity Metrics for Vector Search&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring five similarity metrics for vector search: L2 or Euclidean distance, cosine distance, inner product, and hamming distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bringing AI to Legal Tech: The Role of Vector Databases in Enhancing LLM Guardrails&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover how vector databases enhance AI reliability in legal tech, ensuring accurate, compliant, and trustworthy AI-powered legal solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Vector Databases vs. Hierarchical Databases&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a vector database for AI-powered similarity search; use a hierarchical database for organizing data in parent-child relationships with efficient top-down access patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at September 8th, 13:16 UTC, our Aikido intel feed alerted us to a series packages being pushed to npm, which appeared to contains malicious code. These were 18 very popular packages,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;backslash (0.26m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chalk-template (3.9m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;supports-hyperlinks (19.2m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;has-ansi (12.1m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;simple-swizzle (26.26m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color-string (27.48m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;error-ex (47.17m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color-name (191.71m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;is-arrayish (73.8m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;slice-ansi (59.8m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color-convert (193.5m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;wrap-ansi (197.99m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ansi-regex (243.64m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;supports-color (287.1m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;strip-ansi (261.17m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chalk (299.99m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;debug (357.6m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ansi-styles (371.41m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All together, these packages have more than 2 billion downloads per week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The packages were updated to contain a piece of code that would be executed on the client of a website, which silently intercepts crypto and web3 activity in the browser, manipulates wallet interactions, and rewrites payment destinations so that funds and approvals are redirected to attacker-controlled accounts without any obvious signs to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid being compromised by packages like this, check out Aikido safe-chain!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What happened?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above packages all started having new versions released, an example here being is-arrayish:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see that the index.js file is modified, and contains obfuscated code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After applying a bit of deobfuscation to it, we get a fairly complex piece of code still:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This malware is essentially a browser-based interceptor that hijacks both network traffic and application APIs. It injects itself into functions like &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;, and common wallet interfaces, then silently rewrites values in requests and responses. That means any sensitive identifiers, such as payment destinations or approval targets, can be swapped out for attacker, controlled ones before the user even sees or signs them. To make the changes harder to notice, it uses string-matching logic that replaces targets with look-alike values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes it dangerous is that it operates at multiple layers: altering content shown on websites, tampering with API calls, and manipulating what usersâ apps believe they are signing. Even if the interface looks correct, the underlying transaction can be redirected in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Stays stealthy&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If a crypto wallet is detected, it avoids obvious swaps in the UI to reduce suspicion.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Keeps silent hooks running in the background to capture and alter real transactions.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The domain was registered just three days ago on September 5th, 2025:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After Aikido notified the maintainer on Bluesky, he replied at 15:15 UTC that he was aware of being compromised, and starting to clean up the compromised packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The author also shared that the phishing email was sent from &lt;code&gt;support [at] npmjs [dot] help&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The author appears to have deleted most of the compromised package before losing access to his account. At the time of writing, the package &lt;code&gt;simple-swizzle&lt;/code&gt; is still compromised&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Job Mismatch and Early Career Success&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does being over- or underqualified at the beginning of a worker's career affect skill acquisition, retention, and promotion? Despite the importance of mismatch for the labor market, self-selection into jobs has made estimating these effects difficult. We overcome endogeneity concerns in the context of the US Air Force, which allocates new enlistees to over 130 different jobs based, in part, on test scores. Using these test scores, we create simulated job assignments based on factors outside of an individual's control: the available slots in upcoming training programs and the quality of other recruits entering at the same time. These factors create quasi-random variation in job assignment and hence how cognitively demanding an individual's job is relative to their own ability. We find that being overqualified for a job causes higher attrition, both during technical training and afterward when individuals are working in their assigned jobs. It also results in more behavioral problems, worse performance evaluations, and lower scores on general knowledge tests about the military taken by all workers. On the other hand, overqualification results in better performance relative to others in the same job: job-specific test scores rise both during technical training and while on the job, and these individuals are more likely to be promoted. Combined, these patterns suggest that overqualified individuals are less motivated, but still outperform others in their same job. Underqualification results in a polar opposite set of findings, suggesting these individuals are motivated to put forth more effort, but still struggle to compete when judged relative to others. Consistent with differential incentives, individuals who are overqualified are in jobs which are less valuable in terms of outside earnings potential, while the reverse is true for those who are underqualified.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm the founder and original developer of Nova Launcher. I've been the only one working on Nova for the past year. I needed to let you know that I have left Branch and am no longer involved with Nova Launcher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past several months I have been preparing the Open Source release of Nova Launcher. This work included cleaning up the codebase, reviewing licenses, removing or replacing proprietary code, and coordinating with legal to ensure a proper release. When Branch acquired Nova in 2022, Branch then-CEO and founder Alex Austin made several public commitments to the community about Nova's future, including statements about open sourcing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However I was ultimately asked to stop working on Nova Launcher and the open sourcing effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nova Launcher has been an incredible project and has an incredible community. I'm grateful for the years of support, feedback, and enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past, if you broke or lost your phone, your Signal message history was gone. This has been a challenge for people whose most important conversations happen on Signal. Think family photos, sweet messages, important documents, or anything else you don’t want to lose forever. This explains why the most common feature request has been backups; a way for people to get Signal messages back even if their phone is lost or damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After careful design and development, we are now starting to roll out secure backups, an opt-in feature. This first phase is available in the latest beta release for Android. This will let us further test this feature in a limited setting, before it rolls out to iOS and Desktop in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, we’ll outline the basics of secure backups and provide a high-level overview about how they work and how we built a system that allows you to recover your Signal conversations while maintaining the highest bar for privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secure Backups 101&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure backups let you save an archive of your Signal conversations in a privacy-preserving form, refreshed every day; giving you the ability to restore your chats even if you lose access to your phone. Signal’s secure backups are opt-in and, of course, end-to-end encrypted. So if you don’t want to create a secure backup archive of your Signal messages and media, you never have to use the feature.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do decide to opt in to secure backups, you’ll be able to securely back up all of your text messages2 and the last 45 days’ worth of media3 for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to back up your media history beyond 45 days4, as well as your message history, we also offer a paid subscription plan for US$1.99 per month.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first time we’ve offered a paid feature. The reason we’re doing this is simple: media requires a lot of storage, and storing and transferring large amounts of data is expensive. As a nonprofit that refuses to collect or sell your data, Signal needs to cover those costs differently than other tech organizations that offer similar products but support themselves by selling ads and monetizing data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Anatomy of Secure Backups: Privacy First, Always&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Signal, our commitment to privacy informs which features we build and the ways that we build them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the same zero-knowledge technology that enables Signal groups to work without revealing intimate metadata, backup archives are stored without a direct link to a specific backup payment or Signal user account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the core of secure backups is a 64-character recovery key that is generated on your device. This key is yours and yours alone; it is never shared with Signal’s servers.6 Your recovery key is the only way to “unlock” your backup when you need to restore access to your messages. Losing it means losing access to your backup permanently, and Signal cannot help you recover it. You can generate a new key if you choose. We recommend storing this key securely (writing it down in a notebook or a secure password manager, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These choices are part and parcel of Signal’s guiding mission to collect as close to no data as possible, and to make sure that any information that is required to make Signal robust and usable cannot be tied back to the people who depend on Signal.7 This is why wherever there’s a choice between security and any other objective, we’ve prioritized security.8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enabling Secure Backups&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to opt in to secure backups, you can do so from your Signal Settings menu. For now, only people running the latest beta version of Signal on Android will be able to opt in. But soon, we’ll be rolling this feature out across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve enabled secure backups, your device will automatically create a fresh secure backup archive every day, replacing the previous day’s archive.9 Only you can decrypt your backup archive, which will allow you to restore your message database (excluding view-once messages and messages scheduled to disappear within the next 24 hours). Because your secure backup archive is refreshed daily, anything you deleted in the past 24 hours, or any messages set to disappear are removed from the latest daily secure backup archive, as you intended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Backing up, moving forward&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to introduce secure backups, making sure you can retain access to your Signal messages even when your phone is lost or destroyed. But secure backups aren’t the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technology that underpins this initial version of secure backups will also serve as the foundation for more secure backup options in the near future. Our future plans include letting you save a secure backup archive to the location of your choosing, alongside features that let you transfer your encrypted message history between Android, iOS, and Desktop devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure backups are available in today’s Android beta release. A full public release, along with iOS and Desktop support, is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Someone you’re chatting with could choose to back up your conversation even if you haven’t activated the feature. These chats will continue to be protected in ways that we explain in this post, ensuring that your Signal conversations are only accessible to you and the people you are communicating with. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The free tier includes 100 MiB of message storage. Messages are compressed and stored in a secure backup archive, and we think 100 MiB will be large enough for even heavy Signal users to back up the text of all of their messages. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Media comprises things like photos, videos, GIFs, files, and any attachments. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The storage size limit for paid backups is 100 GB. ↩&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another example: We have also taken extra steps to protect media by encrypting the already-encrypted files a second time with a key unique to your backup and adding padding to obscure their true size. This prevents malicious actors from comparing encrypted files to identify users who are in the same groups, in the unlikely instance that they gain access to the backup files. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For instance, a catastrophic failure could render the most recent daily backup archive unrecoverable until the next backup cycle completes (which should occur within one day). While we believe such data loss is highly unlikely, this approach ensures that your message history remains protected against even the most sophisticated threats while smoothly recovering within 24 hours. ↩&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used Apple Configurator to turn my iPhone into a dumb phone. I can only access the apps and websites I want to use, and it’s feeling great!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to when I started I’m saving about 2 hours of screen time a day. If I kept this up for a month I promised to write a post about this setup. It’s now two months so here’s my post. What follows is a backstory, observations, and a how-to-guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get straight to the how-to-guide, click here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s common to rack up 4 hours or more of screen time a day on your phone. Here’s one way to see the cost of that: every 20 years, you lose 5 years of your waking time looking at your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what had me dreaming about the 2000s and old Nokia phones. But I couldn’t just go back to Nokia. My iPhone gave me Google Maps, Spotify, Uber and Waymo, Kindle and Audible, ChatGPT and Claude, Whatsapp, Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s real utility to iPhones. If only access to utilities didn’t mean I’d also have access to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I often regretted my time on Twitter and Instagram. It would interrupt my flow states at work and detract from quality time with the people I loved. Even alone time suffered: instead of solitude I found myself checking for notifications. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried and failed to fix this problem three times. Let me enumerate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried self-control but I found myself outmatched. On the surface the solution feels simple: why not just stop using distracting apps? For me using self-control here was like a hunter-gatherer using a club in open battle with a nuclear society. Social media companies spent centuries of human effort figuring out ways to get me to check my phone. If I wanted to win, I would need to use guerrilla methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried Screen Time but it was too easy to ignore. Apple comes with Screen Time. You can set limits, but I found them useless. Once a limit runs out all you need to unlock your distracting app is to press a button. Do this a few times and you no longer notice the button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried switching phones, but couldn’t let go of the long-tail of iPhone apps. There are lots of interesting dumb phones out there. There’s some with e-ink screens that are really cool. But they only have a few apps. There was always some app that I missed. Even with recent Android-based dumbphones, there were still apps that were only available on the iPhone (I am looking at you Things 3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If only I could keep my iPhone, but choose just the apps and the websites that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s where I discovered Apple Configurator. Apple Configurator lets organizations deploy specific restrictions onto iPhones. This is what lets Apple Stores restrict the iPhones on display, so you can’t change their wallpaper to something humorous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configurator is meant for businesses, but nothing stops us from using it personally. And it’s free too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found three advantages to using Configurator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is that there is real friction to making changes. In order to adjust restrictions, you have to physically connect your iPhone to your laptop and open up a kludgy piece of software. This is cumbersome enough that if you have enough willpower to go through with it, you’ll be level-headed enough to not want too. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second is that you can actually disable the App Store! This is a marvelous win. Having an App Store in your home screen is like being dieter with a pastry shop in your kitchen. It’s not a good idea. So no more App Store. And combine that with content filters for websites, and you can really lock down your phone. When you are at your weakest, there’s effectively no way to hack around the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the final win, it’s still an iPhone. This means you can make a dumbphone that fits your needs exactly. There are some apps that sound distracting on the surface, that I just needed plain and simple. For example, my startup uses Discord to talk to users; I want to have it. I want the GitHub app. I want Things3 and Waymo. I want to access specific websites. I can set it all up so my phone is exactly the utility I need it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re getting excited, let me prepare you with two cons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is that you have to factory reset your iPhone. You can only set up Apple Configurator with a completely reset phone. This means the initial setup is annoying and will take you a few hours. But perhaps this a good thing too. If you go through this trouble, you’ll be even more motivated to stick with your choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second is that getting the right setup takes a few weeks, and you may need to rely on others. When you start out you may forget an app or two (or a lot more). For example, I went to my gym the day after I set my restrictions, only to remember that they have a special iPhone to check in. You’ll have lots of little frictions like this. As you do, you’ll improve your configuration so this happens less. It’ll get better but there will still be a long-tail. Maybe you’re at a restaurant and they need you to open a website for example. You may end up having to bug some people around you for their phone. It can be annoying but I haven’t found this to be too troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, it’s 2 months in. Here’s my experience so far:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels great. My phone feels like a utility. I think this is the same kind of change in feeling I would have had if I shifted from eating junk food to healthy food. My phone used to have this gravity: like invariably my attention would shift towards it. Now it just feels like a very useful rock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found ChatGPT and Claude critically useful. Whenever I need some information, I can just ask my LLM, and it can give me a distraction free summary. It helps the long-tail of weird situations too: for example if someone asks me to take a look at a website, I can ask my LLM to scrape it and summarize the details for me. It’s pretty hard to get distracted this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in the the last 2 months I have not felt the desire to remove the restrictions. This wasn’t the case with any previous setup I tried. I think it’s because the friction feels just right. I feel like I can control exactly how my phone should work; there’s just a day or two delay. The delay keeps me level-headed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far the only real unsolved issue I have are related to “semi-important” apps. Consider email. I still need to have access to email, and I want to have notifications enabled so I don’t miss something truly important. But 90% of the emails I get aren’t important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not sure what the solution is to these kind of apps. Maybe I can find a special mail app, that only shows you important emails. If I had something like this I think I would just be over the moon with this setup. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to spend about 4 hours a day on my phone. I’m now down to about 2 hours a day. Looking at the stats, it’s 1 hour of reasonably productive apps, mixed with communication apps (my family lives in a different country, so I make long calls). Overall I don’t regret this time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to do this yourself, it’s going to take a 2-hour initial commitment, and about 2 weeks of tweaks to get everything set up just right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first 2 hours, you will factory reset your phone, and set up Apple Configurator. As those two weeks progress, you’ll tweak your restrictions so you have just the apps and the websites you actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s get into those first 2 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to reset your iPhone. Go to Settings → General → Transfer or Reset iPhone → Erase all content and settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first, and the scariest step. Do it, and you are on the journey 🫡&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now head on over to the Apple and install Apple Configurator. Open the app and click ‘Get Started’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can then prepare your device for configurator. Connect your iPhone to your laptop. You should see it show up in Configurator. Once you do, Right click and click “Prepare”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select “Manual Configuration”, with “Supervise devices” like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can skip “Sign in to Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager”. Just press Next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now enter an “Organization”. Since this is just for yourself, you are an organization of one : ). I use my name:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Configure iOS Setup Assistant”, select “Don’t show any of these steps”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click “Prepare”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aand you’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your phone is now ready for Configurator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we start adding restrictions, let’s set your phone up. Go through Apple’s setup, and make sure you do not restore your iPhone from an iCloud backup. This will undo the supervision stuff we just did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you set things up, go ahead and install all the apps that you’ll need. As a way to jog your memory, here are the apps that I ended up installing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;## Reading/Learning

    &lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to set up your restrictions! You’ll create a new Configurator ‘Profile’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click ‘File’ → ‘New Profile’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll make three changes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under ‘General’: For ‘Security’ and ‘Automatically Remove Profile’, set ‘Never’:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Head on over to ‘Content Filter’, and click ‘Configure’. For ‘Filter Type’, select “Specific Websites only”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter some of the sites you want to use. To jog your memory, here are some sites I added:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;## Google Auth

- https://accounts.google.com

## Docs

- https://dropbox.com

## Modern databases with real-time sync

- https://instantdb.com&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Restrictions’ are where we will disable the App Store. Click on ‘Restrictions’ → ‘Configure’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep everything as it is, just uncheck ‘Allow Installing Apps’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that, save your profile. Once we install this profile on your phone…you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s install this profile to your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right click your phone on Configurator, hit ‘Add’ → ‘Profiles’, pick your profile, and you’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you load your phone, you should no longer see an App Store!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a while you may realize you need to install some new apps. When you want to do that, connect your phone, ‘Right click’ → ‘Remove’ → ‘Profile’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you remove your profile, you’re back to a restrictionless world. Make all the changes you need, and then add it back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with that, you have an iPhone dumbphone! I hope it’s as useful for you as it has been for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you follow the instructions and have any issues or changes to make, please send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Ilia Parunashvili for trying the original instructions I wrote out and providing screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Chat Control Must Be Stopped, Act Now!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Illustration: Em / Privacy Guides | Photo: Ramaz Bluashvili / Pexels&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've heard of Chat Control already, bad news: it's back. If you haven't, this is a pressing issue you should urgently learn more about if you value privacy, democracy, and human rights. This is happening this week, and we must act to stop it right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a minute to visualize this: Every morning you wake up with a police officer entering your home to inspect it, and staying with you all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent checks your bathroom, your medicine cabinet, your bedroom, your closets, your drawers, your fridge, and takes photos and notes to document everything. Then, this report is uploaded to the police's cloud. It's "for a good cause" you know, it's to make sure you aren't hiding any child sexual abuse material under your bed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every morning. Even if you're naked in bed. Even while you're having a call with your doctor or your lover. Even when you're on a date. Even while you're working and discussing your client's confidential information with their attorney. This police officer is there, listening to you and reporting on everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the in-person equivalent of Chat Control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Act now!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is happening this week. European governments will be finalizing their positions on the regulation proposal on Friday, September 12th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are not located in Europe: Keep reading, this will affect you too.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are still unconvinced: Keep reading, we discuss Chat Control in more details below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are located in Europe: You must act now to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to stop this? Contact your MEPs before September 12th&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use this website to easily contact your government representatives before September 12th, and tell them they should oppose Chat Control. Even if your country already opposes Chat Control, contact your representatives to tell them you are relieved they oppose, and support them in this decision to protect human rights. This will help reinforce their position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if your country supports Chat Control, or is undecided, it is vital that you contact your representatives before this deadline. To support your point, you can share this article with them or one of the many great resources listed at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, the list of countries to contact is:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Spain&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Slovenia&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ireland&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sweden&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Italy&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image: Patrick Breyer / chatcontrol.eu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is Chat Control?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The push for Chat Control started in 2021 with the approval of a derogation to the ePrivacy Directive by the European Parliament. This derogation escalated to a second proposal for mandatory scanning a year later, which was rejected in 2023. Nevertheless, lawmakers and lobbyists determined to undermine our safety and civil liberties are bringing it back again two years later, literally trying to wear you down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We cannot let authoritarians wear us down until we lose all our privacy rights. Our privacy rights are fundamental to so many other human rights, to civil liberties, to public safety, and to functioning democracies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chat Control undermines all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cryptography professor and cybersecurity expert Matthew Green described the 2022 proposal document for Chat Control as "the most terrifying thing I've ever seen".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And terrifying, it is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most recent proposal for Chat Control comes from the EU Council Danish presidency pushing for the regulation misleadingly called the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (CSAR). Despite its seemingly caring name, this regulation will not help fight child abuse, and will even likely worsen it, impacting negatively what is already being done to fight child abuse (more on this in the next section).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CSAR proposal (Chat Control) could be implemented as early as next month, if we do not stop it. Chat Control would make it mandatory for all service providers (text messaging, email, social media, cloud storage, hosting services, etc.) to scan all communications and all files (including end-to-end encrypted ones), in order to supposedly detect whatever the government deems "abusive material."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is this: Chat Control will not work, it is unreliable, it will escalate in scope, and it will endanger everyone (including the children).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you are not in Europe, know that Chat Control will affect everyone inside and outside of Europe one way or another. Regardless of where you are, you should be concerned and pay attention, and there are things you can do to fight back. This is important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still image from video: Stop Scanning Me / EDRi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why is this bad?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea that it's possible to somehow magically protect information properly while giving access to unquestionably well-intended law enforcement comes from either extreme naivety, lack of information, and plain dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal would effectively break any end-to-end encryption protections, and potentially expose all your files and communications to not only law enforcement, but eventually also to criminals of all sorts (with the data breaches, data leaks, and corruption that will inevitably follow).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a summary of some dangers this regulation would create if approved:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Breaking end-to-end encryption: Removing crucial protections for all sensitive files and communications of vulnerable populations, victims, whistleblowers, journalists, activists, and everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mission creep: Once this mass surveillance system is in place, authorities can decide to add more criteria such as searching all communications for references to drug use, protest attendances, political dissidence, or even negative comments about a leader. Europol (the EU law enforcement agency) has already called for expanding the program.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image: Lorna SchÃ¼tte / chatcontrol.eu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Criminal attacks: Each time a backdoor exists, it doesn't take long for criminals to find access and steal our information. This could include criminals finding access to each service independently or to the entire database authorities would keep. A database that would be filled with material tagged as sexually explicit text or photos of children. This could even create new Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) for criminals. For example, consenting teenagers innocently sexting together could have their photos collected in this database, after being wrongly flagged by the automated system. Then, criminals could steal their intimate photos from the governments.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;False positives: With a mass surveillance system this large, moreover a system with no transparency and little oversight, false positives are inevitable. Despite marketing promises from the organizations lobbying government officials, we all know AI technologies regularly misfire and cannot be reliable for anything of such importance. Loving parents could get flagged as pedophiles just for innocently uploading a photo of their child in the bathtub on their private cloud. Teenagers exploring their sexuality consensually with each other could get tagged as sexual predators (a label that might stick on them decades later). The police could receive reports for breastfeeding mothers. The list is infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image: Lorna SchÃ¼tte / chatcontrol.eu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Overwhelming resources: The inevitable false positives will completely overwhelm the agencies responsible for investigating flagged material. This will cost them precious time they will not have to investigate actual abuse cases. Organizations fighting child sexual abuse are already overwhelmed and lack resources to prosecute real criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hurting victims: Such system of mass surveillance could prevent victims of child sexual abuse (and other crimes) to reach out for help. Knowing that all their communications would be scanned, they would lose all confidentiality while reporting crimes. The evidences they share could even be tagged by Chat Control, as if they were the perpetrator rather than the victim. Sadly, many will likely decide it's safer not to report at all.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Self-censorship: With Chat Control in place, not only victims might censor themselves and stop reaching out for help, but everyone else as well. When people know they are being observed, they feel less free to be themselves and to share openly. This is doubly true for anyone who is part of a marginalized group, such as LGBTQ+ people, or anyone who is being victimized or at risk of victimization.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image: Lorna SchÃ¼tte / chatcontrol.eu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Undermining democracy: This surveillance system would allow governments to spy on opposition. Chat logs from opposing candidates, activists, and journalists could all be accessed by authorities in order to silence opponents or blackmail candidates. Even if you trust your government to not do this now, this doesn't mean it could not be used in this way by the next government. We have all seen how fast the political landscape can change.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Violating the GDPR (and other laws): The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) offers wonderful protections to Europeans. Sadly, Chat Control would make a complete farce of it. The Right to Erasure (right to delete) could be reduced to ashes by Chat Control, including for any highly sensitive information wrongly caught in the CSAR net. Moreover, it would violate Article 7 and Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protecting the children is only the excuse used in hope of convincing a misinformed public. Chat Control is authoritarian mass surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Authorities understand well how important protecting communication and information is. This is why they included an exemption to protect their own communications, but not yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Would this protect the children?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This cannot be stressed enough: This regulation would not protect the children, it would harm the children, and everyone else too, worldwide. Claiming otherwise is either naivety, or misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, the civil and human rights association European Digital Rights (EDRi) put together a joint statement from 48 organizations for children's protection, digital rights, and human rights, demanding that the European Parliament invest instead in proven strategies to fight child abuse. This appeal to reason does not seem to have been heard by most EU Member States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many things we can do as a society to increase protections for children and fight abusers and criminals, but Chat Control is far from it all. Protection of the children is clearly only an excuse here, and a very misleading one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image: Stop Scanning Me / EDRi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mislabelling children as criminals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, this automated system is flawed in many ways, and the false-positive rate would likely be high. But let's imagine that, magically, the system could flag CSAM at an accuracy rate of 99%. This still means 1% of reports would be false. Expanded to the size of Europe Union's population of approximately 450 million people, exchanging likely billions of messages and files every day, this still means millions could be falsely tagged as sexual predators, with all the consequences this implies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worse, the Swiss federal police reported that currently about 80% of all automated reports received were false-positives. This means in reality, the error rate is likely far higher than 1%, and actually closer to an 80% error rate. Of the approximate 20% of positive reports, in Germany, over 40% of investigations initiated targeted children themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, flagged content is simply teenagers innocently sexting each other consensually. Not only would they be wrongly tagged as criminals under Chat Control, but they'd be triggering an investigation that would expose their intimate photos to others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in a magical world where Chat Control AI is 99% accurate, it would still wrongly tag and expose sensitive data from millions of children. In reality, no AI system is even remotely close to this accuracy level, and proprietary algorithms are usually opaque black boxes impossible to audit transparently. The number of children Chat Control would harm, and likely traumatize for life, would be disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Exposing children's sensitive and sexual information&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any content that could be deemed suspicious or explicit by the system, accurately or not, would be flagged and reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When this content is reported, it will likely be uploaded to a database for human review. This means that if a teenager was sending an intimate photo of themselves to another consenting teenager, they could be flagged as sharing CSAM, even if it's their own photo. Then, their photo would be sent to the police for review. Information that should very much have stayed protected and private between these two teenagers is now exposed to strangers. This is wrong, and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even innocuous communications such as daily conversations, teenagers chatting with each other, parents reporting information about their child to a doctor, and therapists talking with their patients, could all inadvertently expose children sensitive information. This is information that should have remained private, and would now be uploaded to a police database, likely stored there forever with few recourses to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more we collect sensitive information about children (photos, faces, locations, identifications, medical information, private chats, experiences, etc.), the more we risk exposing children to harm. This includes systems used by authorities and governments. Even if everyone with legitimate access to this data is miraculously 100% exemplary and incorruptible citizens, the databases and scanning systems will still be vulnerable to attacks from criminals and hostile governments alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only way to protect children's information properly is to 1) not collect it, and 2) use end-to-end encryption to protect it when we cannot avoid collecting it. Spying on everyone and every child is the opposite of that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Authorities' databases will be attacked&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's impossible to perfectly secure information online. There is a lot we can do to improve security (much more than is done now), but data breaches will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If governments mandate a backdoor to have access to all our online communication and stored files, it's inevitable that at least some criminals will eventually get access to it as well. This is even truer if this system is closed-source, privatized, and isn't subjected to frequent independent audits with strong accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a vulnerability is found by criminals, they will have the same access as authorities have to our data. With Chat Control, this means pretty much all our data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, Chat Control could facilitate the proliferation of even more spyware and stalkerware on the market, thriving on the vulnerabilities found in the powerful system. This would allow anyone to purchase access to spy on anyone, including databases of identified children. It could give a direct backdoor-access to pedophiles. How could this be helping to protect the children?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The danger is inside&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if the idea of online strangers accessing children's sensitive data is terrifying, the worse danger in often much closer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, we already know that the vast majority of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by adults close to the child, not strangers, and that two-thirds of CSAM images appear to have been produced at home. Chat Control would do nothing to fight this. In fact, it could facilitate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Child abuse is an incredibly important topic to discuss and to fight against as a society. Utilizing this issue as an excuse to pass a surveillance law that would endanger everyone, including the victims, is despicable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When children are living with the abuser, the only escape is outside the home, and sometimes this means online. Abusers often use spying technologies to control and restrict access to help for their victims. If we make mass surveillance mandatory and normalized, this risks aggravating the stalkerware problem by obligating providers to implement backdoors in their systems. We would effectively be helping abusers at home to restrict access to help for their victims, including victims of CSAM. This is completely unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How to actually help the children&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the politicization of this issue to manipulate the public opinion in accepting mass surveillance, there are actually proven solutions to help to protect the children, online and offline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, governments should listen to organizations already doing the work. Most are understaffed and under-resourced to properly support the victims and prosecute the criminals. Thousands of more reports every day would not help them do any effective work. More capacity to conduct targeted investigation and arrest criminals, and more capacity to create safe spaces to support the victims and witnesses will help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy should be the default, for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If all our services were using end-to-end encryption when possible, and implemented proper security and privacy features and practices, this would effectively help to protect the children as well. Abusers and criminals are looking for leaked and stolen data all the time. When a cloud photo storage gets hacked, your photos are up for grabs online, including the photos of your children. When parents upload photos of their children and their address online, and this data gets exposed (leaked, breached, AI-scraped, etc.), this data then becomes accessible to criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better privacy protections also means better protections for the children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Children themselves should receive better education on how their data is used online and how to protect it. Additionally, it is vital to provide better education on what behaviors aren't normal coming from an adult, and how to reach out for help when it happens. Children should have access to safe and confidential resources to report abuse, whether it's happening outside or inside their home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parents should be careful when sharing information about their children. And when they have to, they should benefit from complete confidentiality, knowing their communication is fully end-to-end encrypted and not shared with anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is so much we can do to help to protect better the children online, surveillance is the opposite of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How would this affect me?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this regulation is approved on October 14th, 2025 (the date for the final vote), the consequences would be devastating for everyone, even outside the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have seen how platforms implemented better privacy practices and features after the GDPR became effective in 2018, features that often benefited people worldwide. This could have the same effect in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every platform potentially handling data of people located in the EU would be subjected to the law. Platforms would be obligated to scan all communications and all files of (at least) data subjects located in the EU, even data currently protected with end-to-end encryption. This would affect popular apps and services like Signal, Tuta, Proton, WhatsApp, Telegram, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Outside of Europe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This would not only affect Europeans' data, but also the data of anyone outside communicating with someone located in the European Union. Because end-to-end encryption can only work if both ends are protected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Chat Control gets approved and applied, it will become very difficult to communicate with anyone located in the EU while keeping strong protections for your data. Many people might just accept the surveillance passively, and as a result lose their rights, their protections, and compromise their democratic processes. Overtime, this will likely lead to a slippery slope towards dystopian authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outside of Europe, you could expect to see services removing some privacy-protective features, downgrading encryption, blocking European countries that are subjected to the law, or moving outside of Europe entirely. If localization-based scanning is too complicated to handle for an application, some companies might just decide it's simpler to scan communications for all users, worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Five Eyes countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have already expressed support for Chat Control, and might be keen to try the same at home, if this gets approved and tested in Europe first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Inside of Europe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without using tools that would be now deemed illegal, you would lose any protections currently granted by end-to-end encryption. It would become impossible for you to send an email, a text message, or a photo without being observed by your government, and potentially also by criminals and foreign governments, following the inevitable data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You would have to constantly self-censor to avoid triggering the system and getting reported to the authorities. At first, you would probably just have to stop sending nudes, sexting, or sending photos of naked children in the bathtub or playing at the beach. Then, this would escalate to never mentioning drug or anything that could sound like drug, even as a joke. Later, you might have to stop texting about going to a protest, and stop organizing protests online. Further down the line, you might even have to self-censor to make sure you are not saying anything negative about a leader, or a foreign politician even. This isn't that hypothetical, this sort of oppressive surveillance already exists in some countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many services you currently rely on right now would simply shut down, or move away from Europe entirely. Businesses might also move outside of Europe if they worry about protecting their proprietary information. This could cause massive layoffs, while organizations move to jurisdictions where they are allowed to keep their data protected and unobserved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, even if this doesn't affect you personally, or you don't believe it will, this isn't just about you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data of vulnerable people would be exposed and their safety put at risk. Victims might decide to stop reaching out for help or reporting crimes. Sources requiring anonymity might decide the risk isn't worth reporting valuable information to journalists. Opponents of governments in power could be silenced. Every democracy in the European Union would suffer greatly from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chat Control is completely antithetical to the values the European Union has been presenting to the world in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image: Stop Scanning Me / EDRi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What can I do about it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if the landscape seems dismal, the battle isn't over. There are many things you can do, right now, to fight against this authoritarian dystopia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;For Europeans, specifically&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Contact your country representatives TODAY. Contact them before this Friday, September 12th, 2025. The group Fight Chat Control has put together an easy tool making this quick with only a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After September 12th, the battle isn't over. Although governments will finalize their positions on that day, the final vote happens on October 14th, 2025. If you missed the September 12th deadline, keep contacting your representatives anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tell your family and friends to contact their representatives as well, talk about it, make noise.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;For Everyone, including Europeans&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;World Nuclear Association Welcomes Microsoft Corporation as Newest Member&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LONDON, UK –World Nuclear Association is proud to announce that Microsoft Corporation, one of the world's leading technology companies, has officially joined as our newest member. This landmark membership underscores the growing recognition of nuclear energy as an essential foundation for powering the digital economy and achieving ambitious climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Transformative Partnership for Clean Energy Leadership&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to meet growing electricity demand globally, the world not only needs to continue to invest in renewables, but also advanced carbon-free technologies. Microsoft has emerged as a leader in securing reliable, carbon-free electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's membership with the Association is a game-changing moment for our industry," said Dr Sama Bilbao y León, Director General of World Nuclear Association. "When one of the world's most innovative technology companies recognizes nuclear energy as essential to their carbon-negative future, it sends a powerful signal to markets, policymakers, and industry leaders worldwide. This partnership will accelerate nuclear deployment at the scale needed to meet both climate goals and the growth in energy demand from data centres."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will participate in the global nuclear industry’s premier gathering in London - World Nuclear Symposium - taking place 3-5 September. This year will include an Energy Users summit where the nuclear, tech and other energy-intensive sectors will explore bold new partnerships, tackle shared challenges, and unleash opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Microsoft's Nuclear Vision: From Commitments to Action&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft joins World Nuclear Association with an already impressive portfolio of initiatives that demonstrate the company's commitment to firm, reliable, carbon-free power, including Long-Term Agreements. The company has signed long-term agreements including a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center, formerly known as the Three Mile Island Unit 1, and signed one of the first deals with fusion energy technology company Helion, through a long-term power purchase agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Microsoft's Carbon-Free Vision: From Commitments to Action&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's membership comes at a critical juncture for the nuclear industry, as data centre electricity demand is projected to grow over the next decade. The company joins World Nuclear Association alongside other technology leaders who recognize nuclear power's ability to provide continuous, high-capacity, carbon-free electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key areas of collaboration will include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Advanced Nuclear Technologies: Supporting the development and deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) and next-generation reactors, including breakthrough fusion energy systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regulatory Efficiency: Advocating streamlined licensing processes that maintain safety while reducing deployment timelines.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supply Chain Resilience: Strengthening global nuclear supply chains to meet accelerating demand.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's membership will be spearheaded by its world-class Energy Technology team, bringing unparalleled expertise to World Nuclear Association 's working groups and initiatives. The team is led by Dr Melissa Lott and includes Todd Noe and Archie Manoharan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This exceptional team, combining cutting-edge technology innovation with deep nuclear industry expertise with will work directly with the Association’s technical working groups to accelerate nuclear deployment, streamline regulatory processes, and develop new commercial models that can scale nuclear energy to meet the demands of the digital economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's entry into World Nuclear Association’s membership reflects the strategic moment that our industry is working in as we work to meet our carbon-free energy goals," said Dr Melissa Lott, reflecting on the agreement’s significance for advancing carbon-free energy solutions. "When you combine Microsoft's technological capabilities with the nuclear industry's proven track record of delivering reliable, carbon-free baseload power, you create the foundation for unprecedented innovation in carbon-free energy technology deployment."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Nuclear energy isn't just part of the technology sector’s energy strategy—it's essential to it," said Dr Sama Bilbao y León, Director General of World Nuclear Association. "Microsoft joining the Association allows greater collaboration between one of the major energy users and the nuclear industry to address the regulatory, technical, and financial challenges to accelerate nuclear deployment. The global nuclear industry isn’t just generating electricity; we're energizing technology."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A former top cybersecurity executive at WhatsApp filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging that parent company Meta disregarded internal flaws in the app’s digital defenses and exposed billions of its users. He says the company systematically violated cybersecurity regulations and retaliated against him for reporting the failures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attaullah Baig, who served as head of security for WhatsApp from 2021 to 2025, claims that approximately 1,500 engineers had unrestricted access to user data without proper oversight, potentially violating a US government order that imposed a $5bn penalty on the company in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He also claimed the company failed to remedy the hacking and takeover of more than 100,000 accounts each day, ignoring his pleas and proposed fixes and choosing instead to prioritize user growth. The lawsuit, filed in US federal court in San Francisco, alleges Facebook-owner Meta failed to implement basic cybersecurity measures, including adequate data handling and breach detection capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the 115-page complaint, Baig discovered through internal security testing that WhatsApp engineers could “move or steal user data” including contact information, IP addresses and profile photos “without detection or audit trail”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The filing claims Baig repeatedly raised concerns with senior executives, including the WhatsApp head, Will Cathcart, and Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. Meta acquired Whatsapp for $19bn in 2014. The app now boasts three billion users, according to Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp’s vice president of communications Carl Woog wrote in a statement, “Sadly this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baig alleges he faced escalating retaliation after his initial reports in 2021, including negative performance reviews, verbal warnings and ultimately termination in February 2025 for apparent “poor performance”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company emphasized that Baig left due to poor performance, with multiple senior engineers independently validating that his work was below expectations. Meta noted in a statement that the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration dismissed Baig’s initial complaint, finding that it had not retaliated against him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before joining Meta, Baig worked in cybersecurity roles at PayPal, Capital One and other major financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He filed complaints with federal regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission before pursuing the current litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The case adds to ongoing scrutiny of Meta’s data protection practices across its platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, serving billions of users globally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta agreed to the 2020 government settlement following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved improper harvesting of data from 50 million Facebook users. The consent order remains in effect until 2040.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his whistleblower complaint, Baig is requesting reinstatement, back pay and compensatory damages, along with potential regulatory enforcement action against the company.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EV battery giant is unlocking more driving range and faster charging, but without the hefty price tag. CATL launched its new Shenxing Pro on Monday, the world’s first LFP battery with over 470 miles (558 km) WLTP driving range and ultra-fast charging in 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CATL launches world’s first LFP battery with more range&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the Munich Motor Show, the global leader in electric vehicle batteries made its presence known. CATL introduced its new Shenxing Pro, deeming it “the world’s first LFP battery to deliver a 758 km WLTP range.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extended driving range is only a piece of it, however. CATL’s new battery is safer and features a record-breaking 12-year, 1,000,000 km lifespan, all while promising to lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also now the fastest-charging battery in Europe, with 12C peak charging speeds. In just 10 minutes, the new battery can add nearly 300 miles (478 km) WLTP range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in frigid temperatures of –20°C (–4°F), CATL said its new battery can add over 250 miles (410 km) of driving range. When the battery is at a 20% state of charge (SOC), the Shenxing battery will deliver up to 830 kW, good for a 0 to 100 km/h sprint in just 2.5 secs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by Spec9&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And what does the USA do? Raid the factory of a foreign company trying to set up a battery factory in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the Hyundai/LG raid was a triple shot by Trump against hardworking immigrants, clean energy, and Georgia Governor Kemp that refused to corruptly "find" those needed votes in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CATL’s new LFP battery is built to last. After driving 200,000 km (125,000 miles), it only loses about 9% of its capacity. Plus, it’s covered by a 10-year/ 240,000 km warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new Shenxing battery is the first to use CATL’s new NP 3.0 (No Propagation) technology, which offers “the world’s best-in-class safety performance.” Featuring its new Wave Cells tech, CATL claims it’s also the world’s first LFP battery that allows cooling systems from any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;— CATL (@catl_official) September 8, 2025&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“With uncompromised range, charging, and durability, Shenxing Pro is the ultimate solution for electric mobility in Europe,” Dr. Lingbo Zhu, CTO of CATL’s International Business Unit, said at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new battery is part of CATL’s aggressive push into Europe. It’s already partnered with over 200 carmakers globally and more than 1,000 European suppliers, but it’s looking to play a bigger role. From simply exporting batteries, CATL aims to build them “in Europe, for Europe” in the early days, and eventually “of Europe,” it said, in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
