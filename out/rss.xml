    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;'Let them.' The small bit of advice that made a big difference to a grieving widow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;'Let them.' The small bit of advice that made a big difference to a grieving widow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Connie Sherburne's husband of 31 years, Peter, died in a crash while piloting their small plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sherburne, a practical person, immediately focused on what needed to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I went home that evening, and the next morning, I got up and I thought, 'Hit the ground running. You've got all this to take care of.'"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She drove to their insurance company in Escondido, Calif., to transfer the insurance for Peter's truck into her name. Because of the pandemic, the office was staffed by just one person. The woman opened the door to let Sherburne inside, and they sat across from each other at a desk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It didn't take her but a few minutes to take care of why I was there," Sherburne recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"When she got done, she stopped and she looked at me across her desk, and she made sure that I was looking at her — that she had my full attention."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And she said, 'OK, so now that we've finished with that, people are going to stop and ask you, "How can I help?"' And then she gave this pregnant pause, and she said, 'Let them.'"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sherburne took in the advice, absorbing the moment. She wasn't the kind of person to reach out to others for help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But because she said it with such force, it really, really made sense to me," Sherburne said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As soon as she got home, she realized that she did need help. The firewood she used to heat her home was running low, and winter was around the corner. Chopping wood was something Peter had always done. But this time, she asked a friend to take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"So many, many people did little things and big things to help me," Sherburne said. "One of the neighbors actually cooked for me for four years — dinners — and her husband delivered the dinners to me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sherburne says she would have never reached out for support if not for the advice of the woman at the insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"In the back of my mind, I kept hearing her voice, you know, 'Let them.'"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years later, Sherburne went back to the insurance office to tell the woman how deeply her words had affected her. But the agent didn't work there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"So I just wanted to tell her how much that meant to me," Sherburne said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It was such a little thing for this woman just to say that to me. But she didn't realize what a huge thing it was going to be to help me through all this."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;80386 Multiplication and Division&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Intel released the 80386 in October 1985, it marked a watershed moment for personal computing. The 386 was the first 32-bit x86 processor, increasing the register width from 16 to 32 bits and vastly expanding the address space compared to its predecessors. This wasn't just an incremental upgrade—it was the foundation that would carry the PC architecture for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The timing was significant. By the mid-1980s, the IBM PC had established x86 as the dominant PC architecture, but the 16-bit 8086/286 processors were hitting their limits. Memory was constrained to 1MB (or 16MB with the 286's limited protected mode). Competing 32-bit architectures like the Motorola 68020 threatened Intel's dominance. The 386 was Intel's answer: full 32-bit computing with backward compatibility for the massive library of existing DOS software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 386 introduced important and long-lasting x86 features: a flat 4GB address space, virtual memory with paging, and a protected mode that actually worked. It would go on to run Windows 3.0, Windows 95, early Linux, and countless other operating systems that shaped modern computing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Faster arithmetic&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to its architectural advances, the 386 delivered a major jump in arithmetic performance. On the earlier 8086, multiplication and division were slow — 16-bit multiplication typically required 120–130 cycles, with division taking even longer at over 150 cycles. The 286 significantly improved on this by introducing faster microcode routines and modest hardware enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 386 pushed performance further with dedicated hardware that processes multiplication and division at the rate of one bit per cycle, combined with a native 32-bit datapath width. The microcode still orchestrates the operation, but the heavy lifting happens in specialized datapath logic that advances every cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the actual cycle counts from the Intel 386 Programmer's Reference Manual:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Instruction&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;8-bit&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;16-bit&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;32-bit&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;MUL&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9-14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9-22&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9-38&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;IMUL&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9-14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9-22&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9-38&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;DIV&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;22&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;38&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;IDIV&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;19&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;27&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;43&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ranges for MUL/IMUL reflect an "early-out" optimization—the loop exits early when the remaining multiplier bits are all zeros (or all ones for signed). Division has no early-out, so cycle counts are fixed at roughly &lt;code&gt;width + overhead&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To save silicon, the 386 reuses the main ALU for the per-iteration add/subtract work rather than having a separate multiplier unit. The microcode controls the iteration, while dedicated datapath logic handles the shifting and loop termination. Let's look at how these algorithms work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Add-and-shift multiplication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The classic multiplication algorithm in processors is the Booth algorithm. However, the 80386 does not use that. Instead, an "add-and-shift" multiplication algorithm is used. This is similar to grade-school long multiplication. The difference is that instead of moving from lower digits to higher, we shift to the right. Here's the data layout:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three key internal registers participate in multiplication: MULTMP, TMPB, and SIGMA. A notable challenge is that x86 instructions support 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit operands. Consistent with the design philosophy of the 8086, the 386 achieves this flexibility by reusing the same registers and microcode routines for all operand sizes. In most cases, the identical hardware and microcode sequence accommodate different widths seamlessly. The diagram above shows how, for example, the result of multiplying two 16-bit numbers is arranged within a 32-bit product: it occupies the lower half of the SIGMA register and the upper half of TMPB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the multiplication algorithm in pseudocode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1: COUNTR = width-1
2: while (true):
3:   if (TMPB[0]) SIGMA &amp;lt;= SIGMA + MULTMP
4:   {SIGMA, TMPB} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= 1      // arithmetic shift for signed
5:   if (--COUNTR==0) break
6:   if (remaining TMPB bits are all 0 or all 1 for signed) break
7: {SIGMA, TMPB} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= COUNTR   // compensate for early exit
8: correction for signed multiplication
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shifting to the right rather than the left simplifies the hardware circuits. Line 6 implements the important "early-out" optimization, which means the loop can terminate early if the remaining multiplier bits are all zeros—or all ones, in the case of signed multiplication. When this happens, line 7 adjusts for the early exit by shifting the accumulated result right by the number of remaining COUNTR bits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lines 1–7 fully describe unsigned multiplication. To extend this to signed multiplication, only a few tweaks are needed: use arithmetic (not logical) shifts on lines 4 and 7, and, as a final correction in line 8, subtract the multiplicand from the upper product register (SIGMA) if the multiplier was negative. For a deeper dive into the mathematics, see college-level computer organization resources such as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 80386 multiplication microcode closely mirrors the algorithm described above, and shows both the timing and the likely underlying hardware involved. The microcode routine shown here handles register-based multiplication—both unsigned and signed—and supports all three operand sizes: 8, 16, and 32 bits. Other forms, such as multiplying with a memory operand, are implemented similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we examine the code, it’s helpful to quickly review the 80386’s microcode syntax and conventions. While the 8086 used 21-bit micro-operations, the 80386 expanded these to 37 bits, adding fields to control more complex hardware functionality. Moves are written as &lt;code&gt;src-&amp;gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;, which simply means copying data from one register to another. The &lt;code&gt;alujmp&lt;/code&gt; field directs either the ALU (using &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;alu_src&lt;/code&gt; as inputs) or the microcode control flow, handling everything from arithmetic to jumps to indirect operations (&lt;code&gt;alu_src&lt;/code&gt; as the jump target). Pay special attention to the &lt;code&gt;RPT&lt;/code&gt; keyword found on the third line of the upcoming listing: this signals the microcode sequencer to repeatedly execute a micro-instruction, decrementing the COUNTR register each time, and continuing until COUNTR reaches zero, i.e. looping for COUNTR+1 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; MUL/IMUL r
; src     dest    alu_src        alujmp  uop sub busop
DSTREG -&amp;gt; MULTMP  BITS_V         LDCNTR          ; MULTMP=r (multiplicand), COUNTR=width-1
eAX_AL -&amp;gt; TMPB    0              PASS2           ; TMPB=multiplier (AL/AX/EAX)
SIGMA             TMPB           IMUL3   RPT DLY ; hardware mult loop with early-out 
SIGMA                            PASS            ; pass through SIGMA
COUNTR -&amp;gt; TMPD                                   ; save remaining COUNTR
RESULT -&amp;gt; TMPC    TMPD           LDBSR8          ; load shift count: right shift, COUNTR
SIGMA  -&amp;gt; TMPD    TMPC           SHIFT           ; shift {SIGMA,RESULT} to get low result
SIGMA  -&amp;gt; eAX_AL  TMPD           MULFIX          ; write low result, set flags, signed mult correction
SIGMA             TMPD           SHIFT   RNI     ; shift {0,ProdU} to get high result
SIGMA  -&amp;gt; eDX_AH                                 ; write high result
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;RESULT&lt;/code&gt; register is used by both multiplication and division. For multiplication, it accumulates the lower half of the product as bits shift right out of TMPB during the loop. &lt;code&gt;MULFIX&lt;/code&gt; is the correction for signed multiplication on pseudocode line 8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Other variants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 386 introduced two new forms of IMUL beyond the original single-operand form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Two-operand: &lt;code&gt;IMUL reg, r/m&lt;/code&gt;- multiplies reg by r/m, stores in reg (single-width result)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Three-operand: &lt;code&gt;IMUL reg, r/m, imm&lt;/code&gt;- multiplies r/m by immediate, stores in reg (single-width result)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These variants are interesting because they only produce a single-width result (discarding the upper half), making them faster for common cases where overflow isn't expected. The microcode for these uses a slightly different entry point that skips writing the upper result to EDX/DX/AH.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Division&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;80386 uses the standard non-restoring division algorithm for division. Here's the data layout:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dividend is {SIGMA, DIVTMP} (max 64 bits), while the divisor is TMPB (max 32 bits). Each iteration shifts the dividend left by one bit and either adds or subtracts the divisor, building up the quotient in RESULT one bit at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1: do:                               // loop body is DIV7
2:     {SIGMA,DIVTMP} &amp;lt;&amp;lt;= 1;
3:     if (SIGMA &amp;lt; 0) SIGMA += TMPB;
4:     else           SIGMA -= TMPB;
5:     RESULT = (RESULT &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1) | (SIGMA &amp;gt;= 0 ? 1 : 0)
6:     COUNTR--;
7: while (COUNTR &amp;gt; 0)
8: if (SIGMA &amp;lt; 0) SIGMA += TMPB;     // DIV5
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's look at the division routine (&lt;code&gt;DIV r&lt;/code&gt; at F6.6/F7.6) directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; DIV r
eAX_AL -&amp;gt; DIVTMP  BITS_V         LDCNTR          ; DIVTMP = lower half of dividend, COUNTR=width-1
eDX_AH                           PASS            ; SIGMA = upper half of dividend
DSTREG -&amp;gt; TMPB                                   ; TMPB = divisor
SIGMA             TMPB            DIV7   RPT DLY ; Loop: dividend={SIGMA,DIVTMP}, divisor=TMPB
SIGMA             TMPB            DIV5           ; Final correction
SIGMA                            PASS            ; Preserve remainder through ALU
RESULT -&amp;gt; eAX_AL                         RNI     ; accumulator = quotient 
SIGMA  -&amp;gt; eDX_AH                                 ; upper-half reg = remainder
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DIV7 and DIV5 are both single-cycle micro-operations. DIV7 implements the core of the division loop, corresponding to pseudocode lines 2–5 (excluding the COUNTR decrement). With each iteration, DIV7 updates SIGMA (the remainder) and RESULT (the quotient accumulator). The loop is controlled by the RPT instruction, which keeps the sequencer repeatedly executing DIV7 for COUNTR+1 iterations—there’s no early exit for division. After completing the main loop, DIV5 performs the final correction required by the non-restoring division algorithm (pseudocode line 8).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Signed division (IDIV)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IDIV is more complex than DIV because it must handle signs. The approach is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Convert dividend and divisor to absolute values&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perform unsigned division&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adjust signs of quotient and remainder&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the IDIV microcode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; IDIV r
-1                BITS_V         ADD             ; COUNTR=width-2
SIGMA  -&amp;gt; COUNTR
eDX_AH                           PASS            ; SIGMA=upper dividend
eAX_AL -&amp;gt; DIVTMP                                 ; DIVTMP=lower dividend
DSTREG -&amp;gt; TMPB                                   ; TMPB=divisor
SIGMA             TMPB           PREDIV          ; |dividend|divisor|, save signs, first iteration
SIGMA             TMPB            DIV7   RPT DLY ; main division loop
SIGMA             TMPB            DIV5           ; non-restoring correction
SIGMA             TMPB           IDIV1           ; correct remainder sign
SIGMA                            PASS
SIGMA  -&amp;gt; TMPB                                   ; save remainder
RESULT                           IDIV2           ; correct quotient sign -&amp;gt; SIGMA
TMPB   -&amp;gt; eDX_AH                         RNI     ; write remainder
SIGMA  -&amp;gt; eAX_AL                                 ; write quotient
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key micro-ops are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PREDIV: Computes absolute values of dividend and divisor, saves their signs in internal flip-flops, and performs the first division iteration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IDIV1: Corrects the remainder's sign (remainder has same sign as dividend)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IDIV2: Corrects the quotient's sign (negative if operand signs differ)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This explains why IDIV takes 5 more cycles than DIV - the extra cycles handle sign computation and correction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Additional notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest hurdles in deciphering CPUs is interpreting the role and meaning of each micro-operation and constant. Their interdependence often makes the process both challenging and fascinating. Consider BITS_V: at first glance, seeing it used in LDCNTR and loop logic, you might assume it simply represents the instruction’s bit width—such as 8, 16, or 32—meaning the RPT instruction would run for that number of COUNTR cycles. This approach seems to suffice for MUL and DIV. However, when applied to IDIV and AAM, the microcode repeatedly failed to function as expected. After many hours spent troubleshooting, I finally came across a clue in a seemingly unrelated part of the microcode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; PUSHAd
ESP               BITS_V         SUB         DLY      0    
SIGMA     INDSTK  -1             ADD             IN=+      
...
SIGMA  -&amp;gt; eSP                                DLY           
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This finally gave me the hint that BITS_V is &lt;code&gt;width-1&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;. Here PUSHA pushes 8 registers to the stack, so SP should be subtracted by &lt;code&gt;8*2=16&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;8*4=32&lt;/code&gt; bytes. The existence of &lt;code&gt;SIGMA-1&lt;/code&gt; (SIGMA, -1, ADD) after &lt;code&gt;SIGMA=ESP-BITS_V&lt;/code&gt; (ESP, BITS_V, SUB) clearly indicates that BITS_V is one less than 16 or 32.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comparison with modern CPUs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 386's iterative approach to multiplication and division was state-of-the-art for its time, but modern x86 processors have moved far beyond it:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Era&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;32-bit MUL&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;32-bit DIV&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;38 cycles&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;10 cycles&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;41 cycles&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2000s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Core 2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3-4 cycles&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17-41 cycles&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2020s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zen 3/Alder Lake&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3-4 cycles&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13-19 cycles&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern CPUs use dedicated multiplier arrays (often Booth-encoded Wallace trees) that can multiply 64-bit numbers in just a few cycles. Division remains slower because it's inherently sequential - each quotient bit depends on the previous remainder. However, modern CPUs use radix-4 or radix-16 division (computing 2-4 bits per cycle) and sophisticated prediction to speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 386's "one bit per cycle" approach is elegant in its simplicity and its reuse of the main ALU. For an FPGA implementation, this microcode-driven design is actually quite practical - it minimizes hardware while still achieving reasonable performance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: None of this is written by AI, I’m still a real person writing my own blog like its 1999&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I finally figured out how to do Gigabit Ethernet over my existing phone wires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Powerline adapter and misery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve mostly lived with powerline adapters over recent years. Some worked well, some did not (try few and return what doesn’t work in your home). One I had for a while gave me stable 30 Mbps, which was little but good enough for internet at the time. I care very much about having stable low latency for gaming, more than bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to my current situation, that powerline adapter regularly lost connection which was a major problem. I got some new ones with the latest and greatest G.hn 2400 standard. The final contender served around 180 Mbps to my office (with high variance 120 to 280 Mbps), or around 80 Mbps to the top floor. It’s good enough to watch YouTube/TV yet it’s far from impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One peculiar thing from the UK: Internet providers don’t truly offer gigabit internet. They have a range of deals like 30 Mbps – 75 Mbps – 150 Mbps – 300 Mbps – 500 Mbps – 900 Mbps, each one costing a few more pounds per month than the last. This makes the UK simultaneously one of the cheapest and one of the most expensive countries to get Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long story short, new place, new hardware, new deals, the internet has been running at 500 Mbps for some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every 50 GB of Helldivers 2 update (because these idiots shipped the same content in duplicate 5 times) is a painful reminder that the setup is not operating at capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problem: How to get 500 Mbps to my room?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Fetish for Phone Sockets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been looking for a way to reuse phone wires for a while, because British houses are full of phone sockets. There are 2 sockets in my office room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough how much we love our phone sockets. It’s not uncommon to have a one bed flat with 2 phone sockets in the living room and 2 phone sockets in the bedroom and a master socket in the technical room. It’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new house bought today could have 10 phone sockets and 0 Ethernet sockets. There is still no regulation that requires new build to get Ethernet wiring (as far as I know).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s got to be a way to use the existing phone infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know the technology exists. It’s one of the rare cases where the technology exists and is mature, but nobody can be bothered to make products for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standards that run powerline adapters (HomePlug AV200, AV500, G.hn 2400) can work with any pair of wires. It should work ten times better on dedicated phone wires instead of noisy power wires, if only manufacturers could be bothered to pull their fingers out of their arse and make the products that are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After countless years of research, I finally found one German manufacturer that’s making what needs to be made https://www.gigacopper.net/wp/en/home-networking/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ordering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s made and shipped from Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was lazy so I ordered online in self-service (which is definitely the wrong way to go about it). It’s available on Ebay DE and Amazon DE, it’s possible to order from either with a UK account, make sure to enter a UK address for delivery (some items don’t allow it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The better approach is almost certainly to speak to the seller to get a quote, with international shipping and the import invoice excluding VAT (to avoid paying VAT on VAT).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Delivery Hell&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The package got the usual Royal Mail treatment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The package was shipped by DHL Germany&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The package was transferred to Royal Mail when entering the UK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After some days, the DHL website said they tried to deliver but nobody home, this is bullshit&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Royal website said the package reached the depot and was awaiting delivery, this is bullshit&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In reality, the package was stuck at the border, as usual&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Google to find “website to pay import fee on parcel”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;https://www.royalmail.com/receiving-mail/pay-a-fee&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Entered the DHL tracking number into the Royal Mail form for a Royal Mail tracking number&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The website said that the parcel had import fees to pay, this is correct&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Paid the fee online, 20% VAT + a few pounds of handling fees&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The package will be scheduled for delivery a few days later&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Royal Mail and DHL updated their status another two or three times with false information&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Royal Mail delivered a letter saying there was a package waiting on fees, though it was paid&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The package finally arrived&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, you need to follow the tracking regularly until the package is tagged as lost or failed delivery, which is the cue to pay import fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the normal procedure to buy things from Europe since Brexit 2020. It’s actually quite shocking that Royal Mail still hasn’t updated their tracking system to be able to give a status “waiting on import fees to be paid online”. They had 6 years!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Items&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the gigacopper G4201TM: 1 RJ11 phone line, 1 RJ45 gigabit Ethernet port, 1 power&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shopping list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A pair of gigacopper G4201TM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The device has a German power socket (expected)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It came with a German to UK power adapter (unexpected and useful)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It came with a standard RJ11 cable (expected and useless)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Found BT631A to RJ11 cables online (the standard UK phone socket)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Found Ethernet cables in my toolbox&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3M removable hanging strip to stick to the wall, the device is very light&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a gigacopper G4202TM: with an RJ45 to connect to the phone line instead of a RJ11 (not sure if it’s a newer model or just a variant, as that one has two gigabit Ethernet ports). Don’t be confused by having a RJ45 port that is not a RJ45 port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a gigacopper G4201C (1 port) and G4204C (4 port) for Ethernet over coaxial. Some countries have coax in every room for TV/satellite. This may be of interest to some readers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plugged it and it works!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full speed achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reminder, this is a 500 Mbps internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;InHome Variant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I discovered soon afterwards that I bought the wrong item. There is an InHome and a Client/Server variant of the product. Make sure to buy the InHome variant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The InHome variant can have up to 16 devices, communicating to any peer on the medium, with sub millisecond latency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The client-server variant is preconfigured as a pair, splitting the bandwidth 70% download / 30% upload, with few milliseconds latency. I think it’s a use case for ISP and long range connections.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully the difference is only the firmware. I spoke to the vendor who was very helpful and responsive. They sent me the firmware and the tools to patch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a fetish for low latency. This screenshot is oddly satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gigabit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The web interface says 1713 Mbps on the physical layer, the debugging tool says PHONE 200MHz – Connected 1385 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to verify whether the device can do a full Gigabit. Unfortunately I realized I don’t have any device that can test that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phones are wireless, which is too slow to test anything. I checked out of curiosity, my phone did 100 Mbps to 400 Mbps right next to the router. Grabbed two laptops only to realize they didn’t have any Ethernet port. I dug up an old laptop from storage with an Ethernet port. The laptop couldn’t boot, the CPU fan didn’t start and the laptop refused to boot with a dead fan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a hard lesson here: 1 Gbps ought to be enough for any home. Using the phone line is as good as having Ethernet wiring through the house if it can deliver a (shared) 1.7 Gbps link to multiple rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, I really wanted to verify that the device can do a full Gbps, I procured an USB-C to Ethernet adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full speed achieved, testing from a phone to a computer with iperf3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wiring&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some readers might wonder about the wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t check the wiring before buying anything because it’s pointless. British sockets are always daisy chained in an incomprehensible maze.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phone sockets need 2 wires and can be daisy chained. Ethernet sockets need 8 wires. They often use the same Cat5 cable because it’s the most widely available (8 wires cable, the 6 extra wires can remain unconnected).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible to swap the phone socket for an RJ45 socket, if you only have 2 sockets connected with the right cable. It’s not possible when sockets are daisy chained. (You could put a double or triple RJ45 socket with a switch to break a daisy chain, but it quickly becomes impractical in a British house with 5 to 10 sockets in an arbitrary layout.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I opened one socket in the office room. There are two Cat5 cables daisy chained. There are 3 wires connected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s probably daisy chained with the other socket in the room, or it’s daisy chained with the socket in the other room that’s closer. Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I opened the BT master socket in the technical room. It should have the cables coming from the other rooms. It should connect the internal phone wires with the external phone line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one single Cat5 cable. There are 4 wires connected. It’s definitely not a master socket. WTF?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that this socket has 4 wires connected but the socket in the office has 3 wires connected. The idiot who did the wiring was inconsistent. The gigacopper device can operate over 2 wires (200 MHz Phone SISO) or over 4 wires (100 MHz Phone MIMO). I can try the other modes if I finish the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The search for the master socket continues. The cables from the other floors should all be coming down somewhere around here. There is a blank plate next to it (right).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be the external phone line? A bunch of wires are crimped together, colours do not match. It’s the hell of a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only sure thing, they are different cables because they are different colours. They might be going to a junction box somewhere else. Probably behind a wall that’s impossible to access!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion: There is zero chance to get proper Ethernet wiring out of this mess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gigacopper device to do gigabit Ethernet over phone line is a miracle!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an enormous untapped market for gigabit Ethernet over phone sockets in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I estimate work as a staff software engineer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a kind of polite fiction at the heart of the software industry. It goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Estimating how long software projects will take is very hard, but not impossible. A skilled engineering team can, with time and effort, learn how long it will take for them to deliver work, which will in turn allow their organization to make good business plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is, of course, false. As every experienced software engineer knows, it is not possible to accurately estimate software projects. The tension between this polite fiction and its well-understood falseness causes a lot of strange activity in tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, many engineering teams estimate work in t-shirt sizes instead of time, because it just feels too obviously silly to the engineers in question to give direct time estimates. Naturally, these t-shirt sizes are immediately translated into hours and days when the estimates make their way up the management chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, software engineers who are genuinely trying to give good time estimates have ridiculous heuristics like “double your initial estimate and add 20%“. This is basically the same as giving up and saying “just estimate everything at a month”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should tech companies just stop estimating? One of my guiding principles is that when a tech company is doing something silly, they’re probably doing it for a good reason. In other words, practices that appear to not make sense are often serving some more basic, illegible role in the organization. So what is the actual purpose of estimation, and how can you do it well as a software engineer?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why estimation is impossible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I get into that, I should justify my core assumption a little more. People have written a lot about this already, so I’ll keep it brief.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m also going to concede that sometimes you can accurately estimate software work, when that work is very well-understood and very small in scope. For instance, if I know it takes half an hour to deploy a service1, and I’m being asked to update the text in a link, I can accurately estimate the work at something like 45 minutes: five minutes to push the change up, ten minutes to wait for CI, thirty minutes to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most of us, the majority of software work is not like this. We work on poorly-understood systems and cannot predict exactly what must be done in advance. Most programming in large systems is research: identifying prior art, mapping out enough of the system to understand the effects of changes, and so on. Even for fairly small changes, we simply do not know what’s involved in making the change until we go and look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pro-estimation dogma says that these questions ought to be answered during the planning process, so that each individual piece of work being discussed is scoped small enough to be accurately estimated. I’m not impressed by this answer. It seems to me to be a throwback to the bad old days of software architecture, where one architect would map everything out in advance, so that individual programmers simply had to mechanically follow instructions. Nobody does that now, because it doesn’t work: programmers must be empowered to make architectural decisions, because they’re the ones who are actually in contact with the code2. Even if it did work, that would simply shift the impossible-to-estimate part of the process backwards, into the planning meeting (where of course you can’t write or run code, which makes it near-impossible to accurately answer the kind of questions involved).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short: software engineering projects are not dominated by the known work, but by the unknown work, which always takes 90% of the time. However, only the known work can be accurately estimated. It’s therefore impossible to accurately estimate software projects in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Estimates do not come from engineers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates do not help engineering teams deliver work more efficiently. Many of the most productive years of my career were spent on teams that did no estimation at all: we were either working on projects that had to be done no matter what, and so didn’t really need an estimate, or on projects that would deliver a constant drip of value as we went, so we could just keep going indefinitely3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a very real sense, estimates aren’t even made by engineers at all. If an engineering team comes up with a long estimate for a project that some VP really wants, they will be pressured into lowering it (or some other, more compliant engineering team will be handed the work). If the estimate on an undesirable project - or a project that’s intended to “hold space” for future unplanned work - is too short, the team will often be encouraged to increase it, or their manager will just add a 30% buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One exception to this is projects that are technically impossible, or just genuinely prohibitively difficult. If a manager consistently fails to pressure their teams into giving the “right” estimates, that can send a signal up that maybe the work can’t be done after all. Smart VPs and directors will try to avoid taking on technically impossible projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another exception to this is areas of the organization that senior leadership doesn’t really care about. In a sleepy backwater, often the formal estimation process does actually get followed to the letter, because there’s no director or VP who wants to jump in and shape the estimates to their ends. This is one way that some parts of a tech company can have drastically different engineering cultures to other parts. I’ll let you imagine the consequences when the company is re-orged and these teams are pulled into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates are political tools for non-engineers in the organization. They help managers, VPs, directors, and C-staff decide on which projects get funded and which projects get cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Estimates define the work, not the other way around&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard way of thinking about estimates is that you start with a proposed piece of software work, and you then go and figure out how long it will take. This is entirely backwards. Instead, teams will often start with the estimate, and then go and figure out what kind of software work they can do to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose you’re working on a LLM chatbot, and your director wants to implement “talk with a PDF”. If you have six months to do the work, you might implement a robust file upload system, some pipeline to chunk and embed the PDF content for semantic search, a way to extract PDF pages as image content to capture formatting and diagrams, and so on. If you have one day to do the work, you will naturally search for simpler approaches: for instance, converting the PDF to text client-side and sticking the entire thing in the LLM context, or offering a plain-text “grep the PDF” tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is true at even at the level of individual lines of code. When you have weeks or months until your deadline, you might spend a lot of time thinking airily about how you could refactor the codebase to make your new feature fit in as elegantly as possible. When you have hours, you will typically be laser-focused on finding an approach that will actually work. There are always many different ways to solve software problems. Engineers thus have quite a lot of discretion about how to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How I estimate work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do I estimate, given all that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I gather as much political context as possible before I even look at the code. How much pressure is on this project? Is it a casual ask, or do we have to find a way to do this? What kind of estimate is my management chain looking for? There’s a huge difference between “the CTO really wants this in one week” and “we were looking for work for your team and this seemed like it could fit”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally, I go to the code with an estimate already in hand. Instead of asking myself “how long would it take to do this”, where “this” could be any one of a hundred different software designs, I ask myself “which approaches could be done in one week?“.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spend more time worrying about unknowns than knowns. As I said above, unknown work always dominates software projects. The more “dark forests” in the codebase this feature has to touch, the higher my estimate will be - or, more concretely, the tighter I need to constrain the set of approaches to the known work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I go back to my manager with a risk assessment, not with a concrete estimate. I don’t ever say “this is a four-week project”. I say something like “I don’t think we’ll get this done in one week, because X Y Z would need to all go right, and at least one of those things is bound to take a lot more work than we expect. Ideally, I go back to my manager with a series of plans, not just one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We tackle X Y Z directly, which might all go smoothly but if it blows out we’ll be here for a month&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We bypass Y and Z entirely, which would introduce these other risks but possibly allow us to hit the deadline&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We bring in help from another team who’s more familiar with X and Y, so we just have to focus on Z&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, I don’t “break down the work to determine how long it will take”. My management chain already knows how long they want it to take. My job is to figure out the set of software approaches that match that estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes that set is empty: the project is just impossible, no matter how you slice it. In that case, my management chain needs to get together and figure out some way to alter the requirements. But if I always said “this is impossible”, my managers would find someone else to do their estimates. When I do that, I’m drawing on a well of trust that I build up by making pragmatic estimates the rest of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Addressing some objections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many engineers find this approach distasteful. One reason is that they don’t like estimating in conditions of uncertainty, so they insist on having all the unknown questions answered in advance. I have written a lot about this in Engineers who won’t commit and How I provide technical clarity to non-technical leaders, but suffice to say that I think it’s cowardly. If you refuse to estimate, you’re forcing someone less technical to estimate for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some engineers think that their job is to constantly push back against engineering management, and that helping their manager find technical compromises is betraying some kind of sacred engineering trust. I wrote about this in Software engineers should be a little bit cynical. If you want to spend your career doing that, that’s fine, but I personally find it more rewarding to find ways to work with my managers (who have almost exclusively been nice people).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other engineers might say that they rarely feel this kind of pressure from their directors or VPs to alter estimates, and that this is really just the sign of a dysfunctional engineering organization. Maybe! I can only speak for the engineering organizations I’ve worked in. But my suspicion is that these engineers are really just saying that they work “out of the spotlight”, where there’s not much pressure in general and teams can adopt whatever processes they want. There’s nothing wrong with that. But I don’t think it qualifies you to give helpful advice to engineers who do feel this kind of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think software engineering estimation is generally misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common view is that a manager proposes some technical project, the team gets together to figure out how long it would take to build, and then the manager makes staffing and planning decisions with that information. In fact, it’s the reverse: a manager comes to the team with an estimate already in hand (though they might not come out and admit it), and then the team must figure out what kind of technical project might be possible within that estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is because estimates are not by or for engineering teams. They are tools used for managers to negotiate with each other about planned work. Very occasionally, when a project is literally impossible, the estimate can serve as a way for the team to communicate that fact upwards. But that requires trust. A team that is always pushing back on estimates will not be believed when they do encounter a genuinely impossible proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I estimate, I extract the range my manager is looking for, and only then do I go through the code and figure out what can be done in that time. I never come back with a flat “two weeks” figure. Instead, I come back with a range of possibilities, each with their own risks, and let my manager make that tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not possible to accurately estimate software work. Software projects spend most of their time grappling with unknown problems, which by definition can’t be estimated in advance. To estimate well, you must therefore basically ignore all the known aspects of the work, and instead try and make educated guesses about how many unknowns there are, and how scary each unknown is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edit: I should thank one of my readers, Karthik, who emailed me to ask about estimates, thus revealing to me that I had many more opinions than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone wincing at that time, I mean like three minutes of actual deployment and twenty-seven minutes of waiting for checks to pass or monitors to turn up green.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I write a lot more about this in You can’t design software you don’t work on.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, imagine a mandate to improve the performance of some large Rails API, one piece at a time. I could happily do that kind of work forever.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

I run projects, I ship code, I review PRs, and so on. But the most important thing I do - what I’m for - is to provide technical clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an organization, technical clarity is when non-technical decision makers have a good-enough practical understanding of what changes they can make to their software systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/quote&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I like GitLab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve been using GitLab for my private projects for years now. I just started using it at some point and never had a reason to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How I ended up here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back when GitHub still charged for private repositories, GitLab offered them for free. That was the initial hook. I had a bunch of small projects and experiments that I didnât want to publish but also didnât want to pay for. GitLab was the obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub eventually made private repos free too, but by then my workflow was already built around GitLab. All my CI pipelines, Docker images, deployment scripts - everything pointed there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Docker registry thing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every GitLab project comes with a Container Registry. This is probably the feature I use most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow is simple. Build an image locally or in CI, push it to the registry, pull it wherever you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No separate Docker Hub account. No thinking about pull rate limits (remember when Docker Hub introduced those and broke half the internetâs CI pipelines?). No managing access tokens for yet another service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my private projects this is perfect. I donât need the discoverability of Docker Hub. I just need a place to store images that integrates with my existing authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 10GB limit per project sounds small on paper but Iâve never come close to hitting it. Old tags get cleaned up, base layers are shared, and most of my images arenât that big anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CI/CD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitLab CI was one of the earlier âCI config as codeâ implementations that I used. You drop a &lt;code&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/code&gt; in your repo and things start happening. The config is versioned with everything else, which means you can see exactly what your pipeline looked like six months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing fancy. Build the image, push it, optionally deploy. The manual trigger on deploy is nice - I can build automatically but still control when things go to production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shared runners GitLab provides handle most of my workloads. Theyâre not fast, but theyâre free and reliable. For the times when I needed something specific - like a runner with more memory or access to my private network - setting up my own runner on a cheap VPS was straightforward. Install the runner, register it with a token, done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The documentation for CI/CD is extensive. Almost too extensive. There are so many features and options that finding what you need can take a while. But once you figure out your patterns, you mostly copy-paste from your own previous configs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The annoying parts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Letâs talk about whatâs not great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed. The GitLab web interface has always felt sluggish to me. Click on a merge request, wait. Switch to the pipeline view, wait. Open the job log, wait. Itâs not terrible, but thereâs this constant friction that adds up over a long session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve noticed improvements recently. Either they optimized things or Iâve just gotten used to it - hard to say. But itâs still not as snappy as GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feature overload. GitLab tries to be everything. Issue tracking, project management, wiki, snippets, package registry, container registry, security scanning, infrastructure management, monitoringâ¦ The sidebar menu goes on forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use maybe 10% of whatâs available. Repositories, merge requests, CI/CD, container registry. Thatâs pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a double-edged sword. On one hand, feature bloat. On the other, if I ever need something like a private NPM registry or security scanning, itâs already there. I just havenât needed it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The value proposition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run about a dozen private projects ranging from active side projects to abandoned experiments I keep around âjust in case.â None of this costs me anything. Itâs crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My workflow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All my private projects live on GitLab. Prototypes, experiments, half-finished ideas, things Iâm actively working on but not ready to share. Itâs my digital workshop where I can make a mess without anyone watching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub is different. Thatâs where I put things I want people to see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This split works well for me. I get the collaboration and visibility benefits of GitHub for public stuff while keeping my private mess organized on GitLab with proper CI/CD and container registries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people do everything on GitHub. Some do everything on GitLab. Having a foot in both camps might seem redundant but honestly, they serve different purposes in my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;200 SQL statements per webpage is excessive for client/server database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But with SQLite, 200 or more SQL statement per webpage is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite can also do large and complex queries efficiently, just like client/server databases. But SQLite can do many smaller queries efficiently too. Application developers can use whichever technique works best for the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Appropriate Uses For SQLite page says that dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL statements each. This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"[This is] bad design"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. In a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message round-trip from the application to the database server and back to the application. Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially, can be a serious performance drag. This is sometimes called the "N+1 Query Problem" or the "N+1 Select Problem" and it is an anti-pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite is not client/server, however. The SQLite database runs in the same process address space as the application. Queries do not involve message round-trips, only a function call. The latency of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite. Hence, using a large number of queries with SQLite is not the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dynamic webpages on the SQLite website are mostly generated by the Fossil version control system. A typical dynamic page would be a timeline such as https://sqlite.org/src/timeline. A log of all SQL used by the timeline is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first group of queries in the log are extracting display options from the "config" and "global_config" tables of the Fossil database. Then there is a single complex query that extracts a list of all elements to be displayed on the timeline. This "timeline" query demonstrates that SQLite can easily process complex relational database queries involving multiple tables, subqueries, and complex WHERE clause constraints, and it can make effective use of indexes to solve the queries with minimal disk I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the single big "timeline" query, there are additional queries for each timeline element. Fossil is using the "N+1 Query" pattern rather than trying to grab all the information in as few queries as possible. But that is ok because there is no unnecessary IPC overhead. At the bottom of each timeline page, Fossil shows approximately how long it took to generate the page. For a 50-entry timeline, the latency is usually less than 25 milliseconds. Profiling shows that few of those milliseconds were spent inside the database engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the N+1 Query pattern in Fossil does not harm the application. But the N+1 Query pattern does have benefits. For one, the section of the code that creates the timeline query can be completely separate from the section that prepares each timeline entry for display. This provides a separation of responsibility that helps keep the code simple and easy to maintain. Secondly, the information needed for display, and the queries needed to extract that information, vary according to what type of objects are to be shown. Check-ins need one set of queries. Tickets need another set of queries. Wiki pages need a different query. And so forth. By implementing these queries on-demand and in the part of the code dealing with the various entities, there is further separation of responsibility and simplification of the overall code base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, SQLite is able to do one or two large and complex queries, or it can do many smaller and simpler queries. Both are efficient. An application can use either or both techniques, depending on what works best for the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following is a log of all SQL used to generate one particular timeline (captured on 2016-09-16):&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Microsoft confirms it will give the FBI your Windows PC data encryption key if asked — you can thank Windows 11's forced online accounts for that&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 11's online Microsoft Account requirement means your PC is automatically backing up its data encryption key to the cloud, and Microsoft says it will hand those over to the FBI if requested via legal order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has confirmed in a statement to Forbes that the company will provide the FBI access to BitLocker encryption keys if a valid legal order is requested. These keys enable the ability to decrypt and access the data on a computer running Windows, giving law enforcement the means to break into a device and access its data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The news comes as Forbes reports that Microsoft gave the FBI the BitLocker encryption keys to access a device in Guam that law enforcement believed to have "evidence that would help prove individuals handling the island’s Covid unemployment assistance program were part of a plot to steal funds" in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was possible because the device in question had its BitLocker encryption key saved in the cloud. By default, Windows 11 forces the use of a Microsoft Account, and the OS will automatically tie your BitLocker encryption key to your online account so that users can easily recover their data in scenarios where they might get locked out. This can be disabled, letting you choose where to save them locally, but the default behavior is to store the key in Microsoft's cloud when setting up a PC with a Microsoft Account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"While key recovery offers convenience, it also carries a risk of unwanted access, so Microsoft believes customers are in the best position to decide... how to manage their keys,” Microsoft spokesperson Charles Chamberlayne said in a statement to Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft told Forbes that it receives around 20 requests for BitLocker encryption keys from the FBI a year, but the majority of requests are unable to be met because the encryption key was never uploaded to the company's cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is notable as other tech companies, such as Apple, have famously refused to provide law enforcement with access to encrypted data stored on their products. Apple has openly fought against the FBI in the past when it was asked to provide a backdoor into an iPhone. Other tech giants, such as Meta, will store encryption keys in the cloud, but use zero-knowledge architectures and encrypt the keys server-side so that only the user can access them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's frankly shocking that the encryption keys that do get uploaded to Microsoft aren't encrypted on the cloud side, too. That would prevent Microsoft from seeing the keys, but it seems that, as things currently stand, those keys are available in an unencrypted state, and it is a privacy nightmare for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see Microsoft so willingly hand over the keys to encrypted Windows PCs is concerning, and should make everybody using a modern Windows computer think twice before backing up their keys to the cloud. You can see which PCs have their BitLocker keys stored on Microsoft's servers on the Microsoft Account website here, which will let you delete them if present.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greetings, this is the official XHTML club (and blog)! This website is both a collection of XHTML valid websites and a simple blog; a lonely software developer screaming out into the abyss of the internet. Ranting and raving about the ever increasing bloat that is the "modern" web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simply put: it's a collection of XHTML valid websites. That's it. There's no "classic web" manifesto or any call to "return to the days of the old internet!". This is just a place where valid XHTML is respected, even if the rest of the internet has long since moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I fully understand how pointless this might seem to some people. XHTML has long been replaced, with HTML5 being the current king of the hypertext markup world. Validation is ignored, and most modern sites are built with little concern for structure or longevity. Today's web is severely lacking in quality craftsmanship. Still, there's value in doing things properly, even when it's scoffed at by modern age internet users. XHTML Club isn't here to shame or persuade, instead my hope is to make you more aware about the quality of your HTML. It's here to show that valid markup still exists and that some of us still care enough to build it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost all transactional emails are being marked as suspicious even when their SPF/DKIM records are fine and they’ve been whitelisted before. Did Google break something in gmail/spam filtering?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a great reminder of how good this feature is that we take for granted. I think this outage has actually improved my appreciation for Gmail (a service I normally only complain about).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seriously. I didn't even realize this was a wide issue, but I couldn't find a school enrolment email I was looking for this morning, and found it in the spam folder. The fact that I basically never have to do this is actually amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been “down” for me for a few months now, ever since Google tied this functionality to the same toggle that opts you in for using your email data for AI training. So now you can’t filter this stuff without also agreeing to a whole swath of unrelated and opt-ins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ive since gone on an unsubscribe campaign, and things seem bearable now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same here. Until recently I would get maybe 1-2 spams a month, and I just got 30 in the span of a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re the very obvious, very obnoxious kind of spam, and Gmail still correctly sends them to the junk bin, so I wonder if they were shadowbanned before and Google simply decided to make the process more explicit (which I don’t hate on principle).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either that or my address was scrapped from somewhere by a spam bot and the timing is coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, my Gmail inbox is full of regular senders being flagged as "possibly unsafe" and I need to click a button "Looks Safe" to accept them. They are not being spamboxed, but they are definitely flagged. Even official communications from the USPS!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason given is that "Gmail hasn't scanned this message", so I suppose the scanners are unavailable/disabled for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They should also be tagged as "Important" but they are not. I believe this is a heuristic-based designation, and it has not been working too great lately. My most important mail is coming through as "unimportant".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are not being marked as "Suspicious" but they are showing an infobox that explains they could not be scanned at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could click "Seems Safe" on these messages, but they are not scanned by Google, and they are simply adding a disclaimer that they currently can't vouch for the safety of a message that they couldn't scan. It seems to me that this is a prudent and helpful course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been happening for about a month for me. I had to start monitoring spam because legit emails end up there. Funnily enough I started having the opposite problem too - plenty of obvious spam and phishing attempt ending up in my mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't understand why spam detection is so complicated. I can tell with high accuracy if an email is spam just by the subject line. I'd think even basic ML could do this very reliably you don't need a bleeding-edge LLM to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phishing is tricker because it can be very deceptive especially if you're being targeted specifically. But also usually pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Are you available? * Paul, can we have a zoom meeting with you on Monday? * Assistance for donation * Greetings!!! * some ideas for you * Refund request * Somethings not working * Manuel Montoya for roof work contractor * proposals for print * Invite Connection&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Half of the above are actual spam, half are not. Tell me which is which ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been receiving a large number of spam emails in my "Important and Unread" areas which is anomalous. I was wondering exactly why and this helps. thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have an absurd and overwrought system involving Gmail, and client-side rspamd and SpamSieve on my Mac. Gmail is (was?) overly aggressive flagging things as spam, so I have the client-side Bayesian filter check Gmail’s spam folder and rescue good email, so long as rspamd also says it’s not phishing. And then add sender to a Gmail whitelisting rule. All rescued email is flagged such that if I later manually move any of it back to junk, it stays there as spam and updates the corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I now never get good email in the spam folder, and never get undetected spam in the inbox, and very occasionally get a spam erroneously rescued, but still visually flagged as iffy-but-maybe-ham.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Gmail has been lax at filtering spam lately, I haven’t noticed, but perhaps the Bayesian filter has been picking up the slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step zero. Never disclose your email address to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very easy and straightforward. I operate 6 Gmail accounts, and three are "alts" where I've basically never given the address out to anyone at all, and they receive zero spam, zero UCE, zero marketing emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, on my "main" I've disclosed the address to many entities and I use it for sign-in and shipping and many things. And yes, I do receive spam and scam emails there, but wcyd?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, spam is no big deal, and any scam that comes via email should not affect anyone who is educated and prepared for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, with a well-known email address, you could run a higher risk of credential stuffing, and an account takeover by someone who hijacks your email account, and then pivots from there to taking other accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this seems to be a risk we all take: email addresses are meant to be shared, to be public, and to be well-known to anyone to correspond with us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will say that disclosing my email address to certain parties has had noticeable effects. For example, I used "MYADDRESS+EchoVita@gmail.com" once, and only once. My godfather had passed away, and I ordered some flowers for his funeral. And I put that order through with that email address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, Echovita themselves had a data breach shortly afterwards, and I was inundated with scam emails. Just all sorts of attackers and they were basically all using the same M.O. But they were readily identifiable because I had used that "+Echovita" to identify it uniquely. And they really haven't stopped coming in. It's been 5 years since that breach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes, especially with untrusted parties, it may help to tag your email address. I don't worry about receiving spam anywhere. But like I said, since I've never ever disclosed the addresses of 2-3 of my "alt accounts" they simply never receive any mail at all, spam or no spam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently had a "role" Google account terminated because I was (paraphrasing) "violating Google policies" by having multiple accounts. I didn't know they were sticklers about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I don't much care because the account was just used for interacting with somebody else's Google-hosted junk but, if I had been using it for something serious, I have probably been frustrated.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no way, no possible way that Google prohibits the use of multiple accounts. They do not. They cannot. I just asked Gemini and I checked the actual TOS. It does not, in any way, prohibit these uses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, this is plainly evident by the way they give you tools to operate them in a systematic way. You can add multiple accounts to a single Android "user". You can add them to a single Google Chromebook account under one signed-in account. You can add multiple accounts separately to the same Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add multiple accounts with the same names, the same birthdates, and the same Driver License. I've validated at least two YouTube channels by showing exactly the same ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google did not terminate your account for the reason you state. You are not telling us all the background information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google may indeed terminate multiple accounts for the same person because of TOS violations. They will definitely link and associate your accounts, so making an "alt account" for misbehavior is not safe. If my "alt account" is compromised or violates TOS, then I can expect they will discipline all 6 equally, because they're all linked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But operating multiple accounts is very explicitly supported by Google, and by Microsoft as well, I will say. I don't know about Apple. Facebook definitely prohibited this in the past, although you can maintain multiple "profiles" and "pages" that have unique settings and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like an easier solution to having six different email addresses is to use Gmail aliases - I've caught a few less-than-honest companies either selling my email address, or been breached without disclosing such, simply by using an alias along the lines of '+service_name'. If any alias starts to receive spam you can setup rules to automatically delete everything that comes in with that. You also get the added benefit of significantly easier and more accurate search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think y'all understand why I have separate Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use them for different purposes. They are "role accounts" for projects I am doing, such as geneaology and astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to use YouTube sanely, and store different stuff in Drive, I separate them into unique accounts. I use those accounts for specific things, and my YouTube subscriptions, playlists, etc. are tailored for each role, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not about email at all. Obviously, I can access all those email accounts through the one app on my smartphone or the one PWA on my Chromebook. They are easily manageable but separate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also run 3 Outlook/Microsoft accounts, and for the same reason. (One of them is my academic account from community college, and the other two are personal.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't need to give out email addresses for the "role accounts" except where I "Sign In With Google" to various services. So I don't really send/receive email from them at all, except where I'm sharing links or documents with myself (the best way to do this cross-account is still by using email, oftentimes.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Gmail since the beta (I got invite from a googler) and I don't remember when they began adding spam control but in my experience the GMail spam check works usually exceptionally well: I very rarely need to add a custom filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My email, over two decades+ (2004?), hasn't been in a many public leaks (only one on https://haveibeenpwned.com/ ) but obviously has made its way to various spammy actors but thankfully nearly everything is caught by GMail's spam filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anything I'd say GMail's spam filter works too well: I get more legit emails in my spam folder than spam in my regular inbox. As in: one in a rare while vs about zero spam in my regular inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have seen a spam button show up I haven't seen in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be a new round of AI training featuring the labour of customers as free employees doing training. Every time we click, we consent to sharing private email data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's your confirmation, then. It must be either a localized failure to some subgroup of users, or triggered by some combination of settings, if some people are seeing it and others are not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its really slow. Too slow to use 2FA or in some cases, verify email addresses or recover passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people can't handle a notification on their watch every minute, or several spam every five minutes, so "large numbers of people" are shutting off notifications on their phones. And human nature being what it is, they're not going to be turned back on again. So the era of getting a notification when you get an email is coming to a close. "Important Immediate Attention Stuff" moved to text messages a long time ago anyway, at least for me. The list of technologies you can no longer reach me on, always increases over time...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Metriport is an open-source data intelligence platform that helps healthcare organizations access and exchange patient data in real-time. We integrate with all major US healthcare IT systems and tap into comprehensive medical data for 300+ million individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We've found product-market fit with multi-million ARR, 100+ customers (including Strive Health, Circle Medical, and Brightside Health), backing from top VCs, and years of runway. We're ready to scale. We're a tight-knit, high-performing team of mostly former founders (including two YC alumni). We're engineering-heavy, operate with minimal bureaucracy and high autonomy, and hire based on competence, not prestige. We push hard—founders work six days a week from our SF office—but give everyone freedom to craft their schedule. We measure output and we're committed to sustainable intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About us&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The following points are an assortment of the most relevant bits that will give you the gist of where we’re at, why we’ll win, and our company culture:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Well funded with a massive recent infusion of capital, found PMF, multi-million ARR, 80+ customers (including Strive Health, Circle Medical, and Brightside Health), funded by top VCs and angels, have years of runway - and we’re just getting started.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We’re a tight-knit, high performing, and passionate team - we work with a consistent intensity and have become a leader in our industry with a fraction of the resources of our competitors.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Consistency means we push as hard as humanly possible, while keeping our health and personal lives in check.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Meaningful work is what gets us out of bed, and we just wouldn’t be satisfied by building yet another CRM company.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;By pedigree, we’re a group of underdogs - we don’t hire based on prestige, but on demonstrated competence and perceived potential.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We’re engineering heavy, and most of our engineers are former founders (including 2 ex-YC founders).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We operate as a relatively flat structure with little red tape, forced structure, or bureaucracy. We just opt to get shit done and foster a collaborative environment with high autonomy - our GitHub commit history and product velocity is a testament to this.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;The founders set the pace by working 6 days a week in our SF office, but everyone is given full freedom to craft a schedule that’s best for both the team and themselves - team output is measured.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; About you&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, we're looking for a security engineer with the following specific qualities:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You’re entrepreneurial-minded, with an olympian-level work ethic (nearly our entire engineering team consists of former founders).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You are passionate about security and are excited to own security related projects within the company end-to-end.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You are confident in your ability to build scalable systems across the full stack, and people usually come to you for technical guidance.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You believe you can solve any problem that comes at you, and don't shy away from diving deep into areas where you may lack domain expertise.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You have a strong sense of ownership over your work, and have demonstrated ability to lead others.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You know how to move fast - while still maintaining a strong security posture.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You care more about the end result and delivering value, rather than what new and frilly tech is being used under the hood for a given feature.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;When someone scopes out a project with an ETA of 3 weeks, you ask yourself "why can't it be done in 3 days?".&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You’re a hacker at heart, and have a good sense of what rules should, and shouldn’t, be broken.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you'll be doing&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After quickly ramping up using our comprehensive onboarding materials to get familiar with our domain, product, and codebase, the goal would be to get you shipping product directly to customers as quickly as possible. Specifically, day to day, this looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Evangelizing security across Metriport’s growing team - we will look to you for guidance, and training.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Driving full-stack security projects , big and small, end-to-end from ideation to production rollout.These projects could include things like: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Implement an enterprise-grade audit logging solution for a new national healthcare network infrastructure stack.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Implement fine grained RBAC on the API key access layer, and more robust roles on our UIs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Help us revamp our internal security policies and put tools in place to keep the platform, and employees, secure while still allowing the team to be efficient.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Helping the engineering team with PR reviews with a security-focused lens.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Work with the Go to Market team to complete customer security assessments and questionnaires.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Work with the engineering team to harden security across the development lifecycle - think secret management, access controls, and vulnerability scanning.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Managing your own work in Linear.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Participating in bi-weekly sprint planning / retro sessions, and quarterly planning sessions.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Attending a daily 30 minute remote stand-up at 7:30am PST Mon-Fri (our only regular mandatory meeting).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Requirements&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You have 6+ years experience in security engineering and information security.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You’re located in San Francisco or the Bay Area (or willing to relocate).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Familiar with HIPAA compliant environments.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Experience rolling out and maintaining security frameworks like SOC 2, NIST, HITRUST, FedRAMP, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Experience rolling out data protection technologies like SSO, MFA, VPN, FIPS, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Experience with organizational secret management.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Experience implementing SCA, SAST, DAST in CICD workflows.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Experience with Mobile Device Management (MDM).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Proficiency in cloud security &amp;amp; networking on AWS - IAM, WAF, KMS, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Proficiency in authentication, cryptography, encryption, and security protocols such as: mTLS, RSA, SSL, HMAC, RBAC, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Bonus: experience with IHE profiles (ATNA, CT, XUA).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Competitive equity + compensation package 🚀&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Salary range: $160,000,00 - $220,000.00&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;item&gt;Healthy lunches are complimentary when working in-office (and breakfast + dinners as needed) 🍏&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Quarterly company off-sites with the team ⛷️&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;MacBook provided by us 💻&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Unlimited PTO (we work hard, but trust you to take time you need to be at your best) 🧘♂️&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Our tech&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On the frontend, we use React - on the backend, we rely on Node.js and TypeScript for writing core business logic. We deploy a wide range of AWS cloud services (ie ECS, Fargate, Lambda, etc), and manage our infrastructure as code with AWS CDK. Data lives in PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, S3, Snowflake, FHIR servers, and more. We use Oneleet for security and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Metriport provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo 0.0.4 and our December nightly builds now support multiple windows (@mrobinson, @mukilan, #40927, #41235, #41144)! This builds on features that landed in Servo’s embedding API last month. We’ve also landed support for several web platform features, both old and new:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;‘contrast-color()’ in CSS color values (@webbeef, #41542)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;partial support for &amp;lt;meta charset&amp;gt; (@simonwuelker, #41376)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;partial support for encoding sniffing (@simonwuelker, #41435)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;‘background’ and ‘bgcolor’ attributes on &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;tfoot&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;th&amp;gt; (@simonwuelker, #41272)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;tee() on readable byte streams (@Taym95, #35991)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For better compatibility with older web content, we now support vendor-prefixed CSS properties like ‘-moz-transform’ (@mrobinson, #41350), as well as window.clientInformation (@Taym95, #41111).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve continued shipping the SubtleCrypto API, with full support for ChaCha20-Poly1305, RSA-OAEP, RSA-PSS, and RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (see below), plus importKey() for ML-KEM (@kkoyung, #41585) and several other improvements (@kkoyung, @PaulTreitel, @danilopedraza, #41180, #41395, #41428, #41442, #41472, #41544, #41563, #41587, #41039, #41292):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Algorithm&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ChaCha20-Poly1305&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(@kkoyung, #40978, #41003, #41030)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;RSA-OAEP&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(@kkoyung, @TimvdLippe, @jdm, #41225, #41217, #41240, #41316)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;RSA-PSS&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(@kkoyung, @jdm, #41157, #41225, #41240, #41287)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(@kkoyung, @jdm, #41172, #41225, #41240, #41267)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using servoshell on Windows, you can now see &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; and log output, as long as servoshell was started in a console (@jschwe, #40961).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo diagnostics options are now accessible in servoshell via the &lt;code&gt;SERVO_DIAGNOSTICS&lt;/code&gt; environment variable (@atbrakhi, #41013), in addition to the usual &lt;code&gt;-Z&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;--debug=&lt;/code&gt; arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo’s devtools now partially support the Network &amp;gt; Security tab (@jiang1997, #40567), allowing you to inspect some of the TLS details of your requests. We’ve also made it compatible with Firefox 145 (@eerii, #41087), and use fewer IPC resources (@mrobinson, #41161).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve fixed rendering bugs related to ‘float’, ‘order’, ‘max-width’, ‘max-height’, ‘:link’ selectors, &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; layout, and getClientRects(), affecting intrinsic sizing (@Loirooriol, #41513), anonymous blocks (@Loirooriol, #41510), incremental layout (@Loirooriol, #40994), flex item sizing (@Loirooriol, #41291), selector matching (@andreubotella, #41478), replaced element layout (@Loirooriol, #41262), and empty fragments (@Loirooriol, #41477).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo now fires ‘toggle’ events on &amp;lt;dialog&amp;gt; (@lukewarlow, #40412). We’ve also improved the conformance of ‘wheel’ events (@mrobinson, #41182), ‘hashchange’ events (@Taym95, #41325), ‘dblclick’ events on &amp;lt;input&amp;gt; (@Taym95, #41319), ‘resize’ events on &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; (@tharkum, #40940), ‘seeked’ events on &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; (@tharkum, #40981), and the ‘transform’ property in getComputedStyle() (@mrobinson, #41187).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Embedding API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo now has basic support for HTTP proxies (@Narfinger, #40941). You can set the proxy URL in the &lt;code&gt;http_proxy&lt;/code&gt; (@Narfinger, #41209) or &lt;code&gt;HTTP_PROXY&lt;/code&gt; (@treeshateorcs, @yezhizhen, #41268) environment variables, or via &lt;code&gt;--pref network_http_proxy_uri&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now use the system root certificates by default (@Narfinger, @mrobinson, #40935, #41179), on most platforms. If you don’t want to trust the system root certificates, you can instead continue to use Mozilla’s root certificates with &lt;code&gt;--pref network_use_webpki_roots&lt;/code&gt;.
As always, you can also add your own root certificates via &lt;code&gt;Opts&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;certificate_path&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;--certificate-path=&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a new &lt;code&gt;SiteDataManager&lt;/code&gt; API for managing localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies (@janvarga, #41236, #41255, #41378, #41523, #41528), and a new &lt;code&gt;NetworkManager&lt;/code&gt; API for managing the cache (@janvarga, @mrobinson, #41255, #41474, #41386).
To clear the cache, call &lt;code&gt;NetworkManager&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;clear_cache&lt;/code&gt;, and to list cache entries, call &lt;code&gt;NetworkManager&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;cache_entries&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple dialogs – that is alert(), confirm(), and prompt() – are now exposed to embedders via a new &lt;code&gt;SimpleDialog&lt;/code&gt; type in &lt;code&gt;EmbedderControl&lt;/code&gt; (@mrobinson, @mukilan, #40982).
This new interface is harder to misuse, and no longer requires boilerplate for embedders that wish to ignore simple dialogs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web console messages, including messages from the Console API, are now accessible via &lt;code&gt;ServoDelegate&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;show_console_message&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WebViewDelegate&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;show_console_message&lt;/code&gt; (@atbrakhi, #41351).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Servo&lt;/code&gt;, the main handle for controlling Servo, is now cloneable for sharing within the same thread (@mukilan, @mrobinson, #41010).
To shut down Servo, simply drop the last &lt;code&gt;Servo&lt;/code&gt; handle or let it go out of scope.
&lt;code&gt;Servo&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;start_shutting_down&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Servo&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;deinit&lt;/code&gt; have been removed (@mukilan, @mrobinson, #41012).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several interfaces have also been renamed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Servo&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;clear_cookies&lt;/code&gt;is now&lt;code&gt;SiteDataManager&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;clear_cookies&lt;/code&gt;(@janvarga, #41236, #41255)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;DebugOpts&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;disable_share_style_cache&lt;/code&gt;is now&lt;code&gt;Preferences&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;layout_style_sharing_cache_enabled&lt;/code&gt;(@atbrakhi, #40959)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The rest of &lt;code&gt;DebugOpts&lt;/code&gt;has been moved to&lt;code&gt;DiagnosticsLogging&lt;/code&gt;, and the options have been renamed (@atbrakhi, #40960)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Perf and stability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can now evict entries from our HTTP cache (@Narfinger, @gterzian, @Taym95, #40613), rather than having it grow forever (or get cleared by an embedder). about:memory now tracks SVG-related memory usage (@d-kraus, #41481), and we’ve fixed memory leaks in &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; (@tharkum, #41131).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo now does less work when matching selectors (@webbeef, #41368), when focus changes (@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #40984), and when reflowing boxes whose size did not change (@Loirooriol, @mrobinson, #41160).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To allow for smaller binaries, gamepad support is now optional at build time (@WaterWhisperer, #41451).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve fixed some undefined behaviour around garbage collection (@sagudev, @jdm, @gmorenz, #41546, mozjs#688, mozjs#689, mozjs#692). To better avoid other garbage-collection-related bugs (@sagudev, mozjs#647, mozjs#638), we’ve continued our work on defining (and migrating to) safer interfaces between Servo and the SpiderMonkey GC (@sagudev, #41519, #41536, #41537, #41520, #41564).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve fixed a crash that occurs when &amp;lt;link rel=“shortcut icon”&amp;gt; has an empty ‘href’ attribute, which affected chiptune.com (@webbeef, #41056), and we’ve also fixed crashes in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;‘background-repeat’ (@mrobinson, #41158)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; layout (@Loirooriol, #41262)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;custom elements (@mrobinson, #40743)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AudioBuffer (@WaterWhisperer, #41253)&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re going to be taking a look at what almost 13 years of development has done for the Raspberry Pi. I have one of each generation of Pi from the original Pi that was launched in 2012 through to the Pi 5 which was released just over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll take a look at what has changed between each generation and how their performance and power consumption has improved by running some tests on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s my video of the testing process and results, read on for the write-up;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hardware Changes Through Each Generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the original Raspberry Pi, which was launched in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Pi has a Broadcom BCM2835 SOC which features a single ARM1176JZF-S core running at 700MHz along with a VideoCore IV GPU. It has 512 MB of DDR RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of connectivity, it only has 100Mb networking and 2 x USB 2.0 ports. Video output is 1080P through a full-size HDMI port or analogue video out through a composite video connector and audio output is provided through a 3.5mm audio jack. It doesn’t have any WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity but it does have some of the features that we still have on more recent models like DSI and CSI ports, a full size SD card reader for the operating system and GPIO pins, although only 26 of them at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Power is supplied through a micro USB port and it is rated for 5V and 700mA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was priced at $35 – which at the time was incredibly cheap for what was essentially a palm-sized computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 2 was launched 3 years later, in February 2015 and this Pi looked quite different to the original and similar to the Pi’s we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 2 has a significantly better processor than the original. The Broadcom BCM2836 SOC has 4 Cortex-A7 cores running at 900 MHz and it retained the same VideoCore IV GPU. RAM was also bumped up to 1GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It added another 2 x USB 2.0 ports alongside the 100Mb Ethernet port. The composite video port disappeared and the analogue video output was moved into the audio jack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GPIO pins were increased to 40 pins which has followed the same pin layout since – which has really helped in maintaining compatibility with hats and accessories. The SD card reader was also changed to a microSD card reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuitry was bumped up to 800mA to accommodate the more powerful CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 3&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 3 was launched just a year later, in February 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 3’s new Broadcom BCM2837 SOC retained the same 4-core architecture but these were changed to 64-bit Cortex A53 cores running at 1.2Ghz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RAM was kept at 1GB but was now DDR2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was no change to the USB or Ethernet connectivity on the original Pi 3 but we did see WiFi and Bluetooth added for the first time. WiFi was single band 2.4GHz and we had Bluetooth 4.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The version that I have is actually the 3B+, which was launched a little later. The main improvements over the original Pi 3 were a 0.2GHz boost to the clock speed and the upgrade to Gigabit networking with PoE (Power over Ethernet) support and dual-band WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuitry was again improved, still running at 5V but now up to 1.34A, which was almost double the Pi 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next came the Pi 4 in June 2019. This Pi came at one of the worst times for global manufacturing and was notoriously difficult to get hold of due to the impact of COVID on the global supply chain. Quite ironically, this hard-to-get Pi is the one that I’ve got the most of, mainly due to my water-cooled Pi cluster build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 4 has a Broadcom BCM2711 SOC with 4 Cortex-A72 cores running at 1.5GHz. So again a slight clock speed increase over the Pi 3 but still retaining 4 cores. It also includes a bump up to a VideoCore VI GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the first model to feature different RAM configurations. It was originally available in 1, 2, 4GB variants featuring LPDDR4 RAM and in March of 2020 an 8GB variant was added to the linup as well. This obviously resulted in a few different price points but impressively they still managed to keep a $35 offering 7 years after the launch of the first Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It retained the same form factor as the Pi 3 but with the network and Ethernet ports switched around. Notably, two of the USB ports were upgraded to USB 3.0, networking was now gigabit ethernet like the 3B+, WiFi was dual-band and it had Bluetooth 5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also changed the single full-size HDMI port to two micro HDMI ports. Most people I know don’t like this change and find it annoying to have to use adaptors to work with common displays and these micro HDMI ports are prone to breaking when they are used often. I think general hobbyists and makers would prefer this to still be a single full-size port but Pi’s are often used in commercial display applications so I guess that’s why they went with this dual micro HDMI configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuit was actually reduced in this model, from 1.34 down to 1.25A and the port was changed to USB C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly and most recently we have the Pi 5 which was launched in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Pi features a Broadcom BCM2712 SOC with 4 Cortex A76 cores running at a significantly faster 2.4Ghz and a VideoCore VII GPU running at 800MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So quite a bump up in CPU and GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is offered in 3 RAM configurations but the drop in a 1GB offering means that they’re no longer available at the $35 price point. There is a fairly significant increase in price up to $50 for the base 2GB variant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some other notable changes are the inclusion of a PCIe port which enables IO expansion and a much improved power circuit. The PCIe port is quite commonly used to add an NVMe SSD instead of a microSD card for the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuit was upgraded to handle the PCIe port addition, now stepping up to 5V at up to 5A, along with a power button for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change in power supply requirements to 5V and 5A is a bit annoying as most power delivery capable supplies cap out 2.5 or 3A at 5V. It would have been more universal to require a 9V 3A supply to meet the Pis power requirements. I assume they steered away from this because the Pi’s circuitry runs at 5V and 3.3V and they would have then needed to add another onboard DC-DC converter which increases complexity, size and potentially the cost, it would also have made it a bit less efficient. But this does mean that you most likely need to buy a USB C power supply that has been purpose-built for the Pi 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 5 is also the first Pi to have its own dedicated fan socket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that’s a summary of the hardware changes, now let’s boot them up and take a look at their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing The Performance Of Each Generation Of Pi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compare the performance between the Pi’s, I’m going to run the following tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I’m going to attempt to playback a 1080P YouTube video in the browser, although I expect we’ll have problems with this up to the Pi 4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ll then run a Sysbench CPU benchmark which I’ll do both for a single-core and multicore.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then we’ll run a GLMark2 GPU benchmark.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then test the storage speed using James Chambers Pi Benchmark script.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then we’ll run an iPerf3 Network Speed test.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lastly, we’ll look at Power Consumption, both at idle and with the CPU maxed out.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And then use that data to determine each Pi’s Performance per Watt.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep things as consistent as possible I’m going to be running the latest available version of Pi OS from Raspberry Pi Imager for each Pi. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can still flash an OS image for the original Pi in their latest version of Imager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll be testing them all running on a 32GB Sandisk Ultra microSD card. I’ll also be using an Ice Tower cooler on each to ensure they don’t run anywhere near thermal throttling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1080P YouTube Video Playback&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started with the original Pi and its first boot and setup process was a lesson in patience. It took me the best part of two hours to get the first boot complete, the Pi updated and the testing utilities installed but I got there in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even once set up it takes about 8 minutes to boot up to the desktop and the CPU stays pegged at 100% for another two to three minutes before dropping down to about 20% at idle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Pi refused to open up the browser, so that’s where my YouTube video playback test ended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 2 managed to open the browser and actually started playing back a 1080P video, which was surprising, but playback was terrible. It dropped pretty much all of the frames both in the window and fullscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 3 played video back noticeably better than the Pi 2, but it’s still quite a long way away from being usable and still drops a lot of frames.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 4 handled 1080P video reasonably well. It had some initial trouble but then settled down. Fullscreen is also a bit choppy but is also usable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 5 handled 1080P playback well without any significant issues both in the window and fullscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sysbench CPU Benchmark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next was the Sysbench CPU benchmark. I ran three tests on each and averaged the scores and I did this for both single-core and multicore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In single core, the Pi 1 managed a rather dismal score of 68, the Pi 2 got a bit more than double this score but the real step up was with the Pi 3 which managed 18 times higher than the Pi 2. The Pi 4 and Pi 5 also offered good improvements on the previous generations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly in multicore, the Pi 3 scored over 18 times the score of the Pi2 and the Pi 4 and 5 provided good improvements on the Pi 3’s score.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the combined multicore score of the Pi 5 to what the single core on the Pi 1 can do, the Pi 5 is a little over 600 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GLmark2 GPU Benchmark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I tried running a GLMark2 GPU benchmark on them. I used the GLMark2-es2-wayland version which is designed for OpenGL ES so that the Pi 1 was supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was surprised that the Pi 1 was even able to run GLMark2 – it did complete the benchmark, although the score wasn’t all that impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results really show how the Pi’s GPU has improved in the last two generations. Prior to these tests, I had never seen a score below 100 and the Pi 1, 2 and 3 managed to fall short of triple digits. Pi 5 scored over 2.5 times higher than the Pi 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Storage Speed Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next was the storage speed test using James Chambers Pi Benchmarks script. The bus speed has increased over the years from 25MHz on the Pi 1 to 100MHz on the Pi 5, so I expect we’ll see these reflected in the benchmark scores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The storage speed test’s results aren’t as dramatic as the CPU and GPU results but show a steady improvement between generations. The Pi 3 did a bit worse than the Pi 2 but this small difference is likely just due to variability in the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;iPerf Network Speed Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I ran the iPerf network speed test on each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 1 doesn’t quite get close to its theoretical 100Mbps but the Pi 2 does. The Pi 3 B+ although having Gigabit Ethernet is limited by this running over USB 2.0 which only has a theoretical maximum of 300MBps, so it came quite close. Both the Pi 4 and 5 expectedly come close to theoretical Gigabit speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Power Consumption Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I tested the power consumption of each Pi at idle and under load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used the same Pi 5 power adaptor to test all of the Pis to keep things consistent and I just used a USB C to micro USB adaptor for the Pi 1, 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idle results were closer than I expected. The Pi 2 had the lowest idle power draw and the Pi 5 the highest, but all were within a watt or two of each other. At full load, you can see the increase in CPU power draw more physical power with the Pi 5 drawing almost three times the Pi 1 and Pi 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Converted to performance per watt using the Sysbench results, we can again see how much better the Pi 4 and 5 are over the Pi 1 and 2. There is a clear improvement in the performance that each generation of Pi is able to get per watt of power, which is essentially its efficiency. Although the Pi 5 draws more power than the Pi 1 under full load, you’re getting almost 200 times more power out of it per watt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts On The Drag Race And Future Pis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed working through this project to see how much Pi’s have changed over the years, particularly in terms of performance. I still remember being amazed at the size and price of the original Pi when it came out and it’s great that they’re still fully supported and can still be used for projects – albeit with less CPU-intensive projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think has been the biggest improvement to the Pi over the years and what you’d still like to see added to future models in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I personally really like the addition of the PCIe port on the Pi 5 and I’d like to see 2.5Gb networking and a DisplayPort or USB C with DisplayPort added to a future generation of Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;BirdyChat becomes the first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 14, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we are excited to share a big milestone. BirdyChat is now the first chat app in Europe that can exchange messages with WhatsApp under the Digital Markets Act. This brings us closer to our mission of giving work conversations a proper home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp is currently rolling out interoperability support across Europe. As this rollout continues, the feature will become fully available to both BirdyChat and WhatsApp users in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, you could only message people who already had a BirdyChat account. If someone was not on the app, they had to download it before you could talk. It slowed down adoption and made it harder to move real work conversations into BirdyChat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the new WhatsApp interface mandated by the DMA, any BirdyChat user in the EEA will be able to start a chat with any WhatsApp user in the region simply by knowing their phone number. Your contacts keep using WhatsApp. You stay on BirdyChat. Messages flow both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This removes a big barrier to adopting BirdyChat for work. You no longer need to ask people to switch apps. You can keep work neatly organised in BirdyChat while staying connected to everyone who still relies on WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What interoperability lets you do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interoperability lets you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start 1:1 chats with WhatsApp users using their phone number&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Send messages, photos and files&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Communicate over an encrypted connection&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use your work email as your identity instead of a personal phone number&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes it much easier to keep work and personal life separate while staying fully reachable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the integration works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp introduced Third-Party Chats in Europe earlier this year. BirdyChat connects through this official DMA interface and does not use any workarounds. All communication between BirdyChat and WhatsApp users is end-to-end encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, BirdyChat supports 1:1 chats, with group chat interoperability coming in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Availability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature will roll out gradually to BirdyChat users across the European Economic Area. For interoperability to work, both you and your WhatsApp contacts need to be based in the EEA. Since WhatsApp is releasing interoperability as part of a gradual rollout, availability may differ slightly from country to country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get early access&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BirdyChat is invite-only while we scale access. Join the waitlist with your work email to be among the first to try WhatsApp interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Productively yours,&lt;lb/&gt;Team BirdyChat&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
