  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Deno Sandbox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve seen a shift in what Deno Deploy customers are building: platforms where users generate code with LLMs, and that code runs immediately without review. That code frequently calls LLMs itself, which means it needs API keys and network access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the traditional “run untrusted plugins” problem. It’s deeper: LLM-generated code, calling external APIs with real credentials, without human review. Sandboxing the compute isn’t enough. You need to control network egress and protect secrets from exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deno Sandbox provides both. And when the code is ready, you can deploy it directly to Deno Deploy without rebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sandboxes?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t want to run untrusted code (generated by your LLMs, your users LLMs, or even hand written by users) directly on your server. It will compromise your system, steal your API keys, and call out to evil.com. You need isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deno Sandbox gives you lightweight Linux microVMs (running in the Deno Deploy cloud) to run untrusted code with defense-in-depth security. You create or programmatically via our JavaScript or Python SDKs, and they boot in under a second. You can also interact with them via SSH, HTTP, or even open a VS Code window directly into the sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Sandbox } from "@deno/sandbox";

await using sandbox = await Sandbox.create();
await sandbox.sh`ls -lh /`;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secrets That Can’t Be Stolen&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is more. In Deno Sandbox, secrets never enter the environment. Code sees only a placeholder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Sandbox } from "@deno/sandbox";

await using sandbox = await Sandbox.create({
  secrets: {
    OPENAI_API_KEY: {
      hosts: ["api.openai.com"],
      value: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    },
  },
});

await sandbox.sh`echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`;
// DENO_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER_b14043a2f578cba75ebe04791e8e2c7d4002fd0c1f825e19...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real key materializes only when the sandbox makes an outbound request to an approved host. If prompt-injected code tries to exfiltrate that placeholder to &lt;code&gt;evil.com&lt;/code&gt;? Useless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Network Egress Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also restrict which hosts the sandbox can talk to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;await using sandbox = await Sandbox.create({
  allowNet: ["api.openai.com", "*.anthropic.com"],
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any request to an unlisted host gets blocked at the VM boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both features are implemented via an outbound proxy similar to coder/httpjail. This gives us a chokepoint for policy enforcement. We plan to add more capabilities here: analytics for outbound connections and programmatic hooks for trusted code to inspect or modify requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re running untrusted JavaScript or TypeScript, combine this with Deno’s &lt;code&gt;--allow-net&lt;/code&gt; flag for defense in depth: VM-level network restrictions plus
runtime-level permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sandbox to Production&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sandbox.deploy()&lt;/code&gt; deploys code from your sandbox directly to Deno Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const build = await sandbox.deploy("my-app", {
  production: true,
  build: { mode: "none", entrypoint: "server.ts" },
});

const revision = await build.done;
console.log(revision.url);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One call to go from sandbox to production deployment. No rebuilding in a different CI system, no re-authenticating with a different tool. Just turn your dev environment directly into a production ready, auto-scaling serverless deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Persistence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sandboxes are ephemeral by default, but when you need state we have you covered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Volumes: read-write storage for caches, databases, user data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshots: read-only images for pre-installed toolchains and volume base&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;apt-get install&lt;/code&gt; once, snapshot it, and every future sandbox boots with
everything already installed. Create read-write volumes from the snapshots to
create a fresh development environment in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical Details&lt;/head&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;768 MB - 4 GB&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Lifetime&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ephemeral or timeout (supports extending on demand)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Max lifetime&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;30 minutes&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Boot time&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt; 1 second&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perfect for AI agents executing code, vibe-coding environments, secure plugin systems, ephemeral CI runners, and customer-supplied code.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Tractor&lt;/head&gt;Mon 19 January 2026&lt;p&gt;Tagged: cad, metalwork&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The electric tractor is finished! I have been working on this on and off for about 6 months. It is a toy for children (and me) to drive around the garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building the tractor has been fun for both me and Lucy. On many occasions she has asked "can we go and work on the tractor? right now?" and the two of us would go out to the garage and tinker with whatever was in progress at the time. Often she would get bored and go back in the house quite quickly, but that's par for the course for a 3-year-old. With any luck some of the philosophy of creation will rub off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Specs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tractor is powered by a 350W brushed DC motor with a 36v Li-ion ebike battery. You may be thinking that 350 watts doesn't sound very powerful, and you're right. It is a toy for children to drive around the garden, being slow is a feature not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rear axle is solid, meaning the two rear wheels always turn together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front axle pivots around a pin in the centre, which keeps all 4 wheels on the ground when driving over uneven terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has a cable-operated disc brake on the rear axle which is very ineffective, but slightly better than not having a brake at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seat position is adjustable, so that adults can just about squeeze on to it and toddlers can just about reach the pedals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the tractor has very poor handling characteristics if you're an adult, because all of your weight is over the solid rear axle and the rear tyres have much more grip than the front, so you have to lean forwards to make it steer. For a while I had one of the rear wheels free-wheeling, which makes it steer better, but means it sometimes gets stuck on hills where you can't drive forwards, you can only wheelie to the side, which on balance is worse. I expect it's not as bad for small children because they're a.) not as heavy, and b.) sitting further forwards anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chassis&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of the chassis is a plywood box which is open at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this picture you can see the pin that the front axle pivots on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you can see the pencil lines that roughly show the limits of motion of the lower edge of the axle beam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe the front wheels are for a sack truck, this sort of thing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are very cheap, a pair of wheels with tyres and hubs and bearings (brand new) on eBay is only Â£12 including postage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Steering&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to copy the steering arrangement from a Ferguson TE20, which originally was my reference design for the canonical tractor, although I obviously went over to the dark side with the colour scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TE20 steering wheel goes down to a gearbox quite near the driver, a shaft comes out each side, one turning clockwise and the other anticlockwise (as viewed from one fixed reference side), an arm off each shaft holds one end of a track rod, and the other end of the track rod is connected to an arm on the stub axle kingpin thing. Highlighted in red here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To replicate this I made a steering gearbox using angle grinder gears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The yellow one is a test print - the final one is in black Polymaker PC-Max material with heavy wall thickness and lots of infill).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angle grinder gears are available cheaply and are a good way to buy high-quality bevel gears in about a 3:1 ratio, if you don't need them to be particularly heavy duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One issue with my steering gearbox is that there is no way to install it in the chassis because the shafts stick out the sides. This was an oversight, in CAD there is no difficulty. The solution is to assemble the parts in place inside the chassis. This is inconvenient in the extreme and if I were to do it again I would try to make it removable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arms that mount on the shafts are made of 3mm thick mild steel flat bar, bent around a rod, and then drilled for a mounting hole for the rod end, and drilled and cut to make a split-clamp for the steering shaft and kingpin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is effective and relatively easy to make, doesn't even require any machining, I'd do this again. The only drawback is that there's not a convenient way to key it to the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally I was planning to figure out a way to key it to the shaft after I had got the steering geometry sorted out, and therefore after I knew the angle that it wanted to be keyed at, but I have since realised that having these joints able to slip in the event of a crash is an "engineered failure" that prevents destroying the plastic gearbox. So I'm leaving it as it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made the steering wheel myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It consists of 2 CNC aluminium parts, one is just a ring, and the other is the 3-pronged part for the centre of the wheel. The 3-pronged part is then bent so that the prongs sit at the right diameter, and then the 3d-printed grips are added each side, with a bolt on each prong holding the whole stack together. It is relatively flimsy, I probably wouldn't do it this way again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rear axle&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rear wheels are ride-on lawnmower rear wheels. They fit a 19mm axle, which annoyingly is not a size that I was able to buy cheap pillow block bearings for. In hindsight, maybe they actually fit a 3/4" axle and it would have been easy? In any case, I don't want to deliberately construct objects with imperial measurements, that's just trouble for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So instead I went with a 20mm axle, and 20mm pillow block bearings, but turned the ends down to 19mm to suit the wheels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this would be easy because I was labouring under the misapprehension that a 20mm shaft would fit through the spindle bore on my mini lathe. It does not! It's very close, but it doesn't fit. Possibly you could bore out the spindle bore slightly so that it would fit, but I didn't think of that at the time, and probably it is hardened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it can't go through the spindle bore. And the axle is too long to support the loose end with the tailstock on my lathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my solution was to support the loose end with a plastic bush in a piece of wood clamped in the vice, and kick the tail end of the lathe around to square it up until it's not turning a taper. This actually worked very well and I ended up with a taper going from 18.94mm to 18.97mm over 150mm length, which for all I know is as parallel as I turn anything at the best of times. See this video clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the only part I can't turn down to 19mm is the tiny bit at the headstock end which is clamped in the collet, which I filed down to match the 19mm diameter after I was finished with the rest of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rear wheels have 2 flats in their bores to key them to the axle. I machined matching flats on the axle with my homemade CNC machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wheels are kept from sliding off the axle by split pins, one just outside each wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the axle also has carriers for the sprocket and the brake disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I originally mounted both of these by making an M6 tapped cross-drilled hole in the axle, and making a hub with a 6mm cross-drilled hole through it, and then bolting the hub to the axle. This provides both axial location and torque transmission so I thought it was a simple and effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the head of the bolt fixing the sprocket carrier to the axle in this pic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately fixing a hub to the axle with a single bolt through a hole is not adequate because the shear force is very large. Eventually the bolt holding the sprocket on snapped. I replaced it with a new bolt and it snapped again, so then I welded the carrier to the axle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It hasn't snapped yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Countershaft&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally I thought it would work if the motor drove the rear axle with just a chain and sprockets, but I had missed out a factor of Pi in my calculation. Having the motor drive the rear axle requires about a 30:1 reduction, which is far too extreme, would require a rear sprocket with about 300 teeth. So I added a countershaft to gain back the factor of ~3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the countershaft in this pic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is supported by a couple of small pillow block bearings on a big piece of steel box section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shaft is simply an M12 bolt. The large sprocket is bolted to a big piece of aluminium, which is keyed to the bolt with a hexagon machined into the centre, which the bolt head is hammered into. And the small sprocket has a couple of flats on it, rather like the rear wheels, and I filed matching flats onto the threads at the end of the bolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reverse&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motor controller that I got doesn't have a way to reverse the motor, so I implemented reverse by putting an "on-off-on" DPDT switch in the wires that go to the motor, so that in one position positive and negative connect to the motor one way, in the middle position it's disconnected, and in the third position the polarity is reversed. This works fine but you need to make sure your switch can handle the current. In my case it's not too hard because 350W at 36V is only 10 amps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the switch sticking up from underneath the chassis here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(It has a black rubbery cover).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I later added a lever so that it is easier to switch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lever has no actual bearings, it just rides in holes drilled in the wood. This is more than adequate for the kind of speeds and loads that a gear lever experiences, which are basically zero. The holes just need to constrain its location. A bonus is that the natural friction in the holes prevents the lever from rattling around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did add a gate to indicate the selection, and constrain the movement to prevent damaging the switch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text is done with multicolour printing on the Bambu X1 Carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Brake&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the brake is from a mini moto. It doesn't work very well and I haven't done a very good job of fitting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can pretty much see how it works in this pic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pedal on the left-hand side (right-hand side in pic) pulls on the cable, which then pulls on the lever on the caliper, which presses the pads against the disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the gear lever, the shaft is not on any sort of bearing, it just pivots in holes drilled in the wood. I think this is also fine for the brake, because it doesn't get much use, although the force on the brake pedal is much higher than on the gear lever. If the pivots do get worn out then they can easily be drilled out and bushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonnet&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put off making the bonnet for a good while because I originally wanted to do something like a Ferguson TE20 bonnet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I couldn't work out how to do all the curves. My best plan was to break up the design into large flat surfaces and small curved surfaces, and make the large flat parts out of plywood and 3d print the small curved parts and somehow join them together and body-fill over the crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Lucy acquired this toy tractor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I saw that there is no need for the complex compound curves. Just a single curve will do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I tried to form the curved part with "kerf bending", but:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It instantly snapped instead of bending. I think I had the grain in the outer layer of plywood running in the wrong direction. It might have bent nicely if it was the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In for a penny, in for a pound, I carried on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And actually that was starting to look like I might get away with it. So I filled the gaps with glue to make it hold its shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after a few rounds of body-filling and sanding, I was actually really pleased with the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Throttle conditioner&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The throttle response is very dissatisfying. It starts off from a standstill with quite a violent kick and then immediately tapers off into having hardly any power at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the plan was to make an Arduino project that would take the throttle position as input and output a "conditioned" throttle position as output, which would ramp up gradually as you initially apply the throttle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The throttle conditioner is in the yellow box here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it did work, it also somehow prevented the throttle from ever reaching 100%. The throttle position is transmitted as an analogue signal, and I think the analogue output of the Arduino topped out at a lower voltage than 100% throttle. I didn't care to fix it, and I realised that this was an unnecessary complexity, so I just removed the electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I even had a magnet and sensor to detect when it was changed between forwards and reverse so that it would instantly cut the throttle when you change direction to avoid damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is not the way. A machine should obey the will of its operator, not its constructor, and it is incumbent on the operator not to operate in a way that damages the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Painting&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I despise painting. It is one of those jobs that takes way longer than it feels like it ought to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1: disassemble the completed tractor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 2: brush paint white "knot-block" primer onto the chassis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 3: spray grey primer on everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 4: draw the rest of the owl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Welding&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a long time since I did a lot of welding, and my welds on this tractor are rather poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have experimented with the welder today and discovered that my prior mental model about how the welder works was totally wrong. I had thought that turning up the voltage would make it "hotter", and turning up the wire speed would make it "build up more material". As if it's a 3d printer extruder and voltage sets temperature and wire speed sets extrusion feed rate. But that's not how it works at all! In fact turning up the wire speed makes it hotter, and turning down the voltage makes it build up more material. I don't really understand the physics of why that is the case, but at least I know how to control the machine now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like my blog, please consider subscribing to the RSS feed or the mailing list:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I miss thinking hard.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you read this post, ask yourself a question: When was the last time you truly thought hard?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By “thinking hard,” I mean encountering a specific, difficult problem and spending multiple days just sitting with it to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a) All the time. b) Never. c) Somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your answer is (a) or (b), this post isn't for you. But if, like me, your response is (c), you might get something out of this, if only the feeling that you aren't alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a disclaimer: this post has no answers, not even suggestions. It is simply a way to vent something I've been feeling for the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Builder and The Thinker&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe my personality is built on two primary traits:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Builder (The desire to create, ship, and be pragmatic).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Thinker (The need for deep, prolonged mental struggle).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The builder is pretty self explanatory, it’s motivated by velocity and utility. It is the part of me that craves the transition from “idea” to “reality.” It loves the dopamine hit of a successful deploy, the satisfaction of building systems to solve real problems, and the knowledge that someone, somewhere, is using my tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explain the Thinker , I need to go back to my university days studying physics. Every now and then, we would get homework problems that were significantly harder than average. Even if you had a decent grasp of the subject, just coming up with an approach was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I observed that students fell into three categories when facing these problems (well, four, if you count the 1% of geniuses for whom no problem was too hard).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Type 1: The majority. After a few tries, they gave up and went to the professor or a TA for help.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Type 2: The Researchers. They went to the library to look for similar problems or insights to make the problem approachable. They usually succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Type 3: The Thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I fell into the third category, which, in my experience, was almost as rare as the genius 1%. My method was simply to think. To think hard and long. Often for several days or weeks, all my non-I/O brain time was relentlessly chewing on possible ways to solve the problem, even while I was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This method never failed me. I always felt that deep prolonged thinking was my superpower. I might not be as fast or naturally gifted as the top 1%, but given enough time, I was confident I could solve anything. I felt a deep satisfaction in that process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Conflict with AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That satisfaction is why software engineering was initially so gratifying. It hit the right balance. It satisfied The Builder (feeling productive and pragmatic by creating useful things) and The Thinker (solving really hard problems). Thinking back, the projects where I grew the most as an engineer were always the ones with a good number of really hard problems that needed creative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But recently, the number of times I truly ponder a problem for more than a couple of hours has decreased tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, I blame AI for this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently writing much more, and more complicated software than ever, yet I feel I am not growing as an engineer at all. When I started meditating on why I felt “stuck,” I realized I am starving The Thinker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Vibe coding” satisfies the Builder. It feels great to see to pass from idea to reality in a fraction of a time that would take otherwise. But it has drastically cut the times I need to came up with creative solutions for technical problems. I know many people who are purely Builders, for them this era is the best thing that ever happened. But for me, something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Trap of Pragmatism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know what you might be thinking: "If you can ‘vibe code’ your way through it, the problem wasn’t actually hard."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that misses the point. It’s not that AI is good for hard problems, it’s not even that good for easy problems. I’m confident that my third manual rewrite of a module would be much better than anything the AI can output. But I am also a pragmatist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I can get a solution that is “close enough” in a fraction of the time and effort, it is irrational not to take the AI route. And that is the real problem: I cannot simply turn off my pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I am a Builder. I like building things. The faster I build, the better. Even if I wanted to reject AI and go back to the days where the Thinker's needs were met by coding, the Builder in me would struggle with the inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though the AI almost certainly won't come up with a 100% satisfying solution, the 70% solution it achieves usually hits the “good enough” mark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So, what now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don’t know. I am still figuring it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if my two halves can be satisfied by coding anymore. You can always aim for harder projects, hoping to find problems where AI fails completely. I still encounter those occasionally, but the number of problems requiring deep creative solutions feels like it is diminishing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have tried to get that feeling of mental growth outside of coding. I tried getting back in touch with physics, reading old textbooks. But that wasn’t successful either. It is hard to justify spending time and mental effort solving physics problems that aren’t relevant or state-of-the-art when I know I could be building things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Builder side won’t let me just sit and think about unsolved problems, and my Thinker side is starving while I vibe-code. I am not sure if there will ever be a time again when both needs can be met at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People expect perfection. Consider the reaction when someone who has been vaccinated against a particular disease nevertheless dies of it. Mathematical proof carries the aura of perfection, but again people’s expectations will sometimes be dashed. As outlined in an earlier post, the verification of a real world system is never finished. We can seldom capture 100% of reality, so failure remains possible. Even in a purely mathematical proof, there are plenty of ways to screw up. Plus, proof assistants have bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Some badly broken proofs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I refereed a paper about the verification of some obscure application. I recall that the theoretical framework depended on several parameters, among them $z$, a nonzero complex number. This context was repeated for all the theorems in the paper: each included the assumption $\forall z.\, z\not=0$. Needless to say, that assumption is flatly false. The author of the paper had presumably intended to write something like $\forall z.\, z\not=0 \to \cdots$. The error is easy to overlook, and I only became suspicious because the proofs looked too simple. The entire development was invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle would have helped here. For one thing, Sledgehammer warns you if it detects a contradiction in your background theory. And also, when you have a series of theorems that all depend on the same context, you can prove them within a locale, with assumptions such as $z\not=0$ laid out clearly. Even without locales, the Isabelle practice of listing the assumptions separately in the theorem statement would have avoided the problem. Isabelle newbies frequently ask why we prefer inference rules with explicit premises and conclusions over formulas like $\forall x.\,P(x) \to Q(x)$. It is to avoid the confusing clutter of quantifiers and implications and the further clutter of the proof steps needed to get rid of them (&lt;code&gt;intros&lt;/code&gt; in Rocq).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in some cases, Isabelle itself can be the problem. Once, a student had proved some false statement and then used it to prove all the other claims (easily!). But how did he prove the false statement in the first place? Actually he didn’t: his proof was stuck in a loop. By a quirk of multithreading: when processing a theory file, If one Isabelle thread gets bogged down, other threads will still race ahead under the assumption that the bogged-down proof will eventually succeed. Such issues are easily identified if you run your theory in batch mode: it would simply time out. I have given an example of this error in another post. Experienced users know to be wary when proofs go through too easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to prove nonsense is getting your definitions wrong. With luck, the lemmas that you have to prove about your definitions will reveal any errors. Apart from that, you will be okay provided the definitions do not appear in the main theorem. Recently I completed a large proof where I was deeply unsure that I understood the subject matter. Fortunately, the headline result included none of the intricate definitions involved in the work. The key point is that making a definition in a proof assistant does not compromise its consistency. If the definition is wrong, theorems mentioning it will not mean what you think they mean, but you will not be able to prove $1=0$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also the answer to those who complain that $x/0=0$ in Isabelle (also, in HOL and Lean): if your theorem does not mention1 the division symbol then it doesn’t matter. And if it does mention division, then the only possible discrepancy between Isabelle’s interpretation and the traditional one involves division by zero; in that case, there is no traditional interpretation to disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Soundness bugs in proof assistants&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect proof assistants to be correct, but how trustworthy are they really? I spent a little time tracking down soundness errors in a few of them: first, naturally, Isabelle, where there has been one error every 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025 (last February), somebody showed how to prove false in Isabelle/HOL using normalisation by evaluation, which bypasses the proof kernel. This was not a kernel bug, and unlikely to bump into by accident, but it was obviously unacceptable and was fixed in the following Isabelle release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Ondřej Kunčar found a bug in Isabelle/HOL’s treatment of overloaded definitions. A particularly cunning circular definition was accepted and could be used to prove false. I recall arguing that this was not really a soundness bug. But just above, I have noted how important it is that definitions preserve consistency: in particular, that they can be eliminated (in principle) by substitution. Kunčar and Popescu put a great effort into not just fixing this bug but putting the definition mechanism onto a sound theoretical bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Obua discovered that essentially no checks were being performed on overloaded definitions. He discovered a not-quite-so cunning circular definition that could be used to prove false (details in the previous paper).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There must have been earlier soundness bugs in Isabelle, but I cannot remember any beyond those above. Definitions were not being checked for circularity because Isabelle was specialised research software and I couldn’t be bothered to stop people from hanging themselves: that old UNIX spirit. But good computer systems do protect users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early soundness bug in HOL88 also involved definitions. It was omitting to check that all the variables on the right hand side of the definition also appeared on the left-hand side. That leads to a contradiction trivially. A subtler error is to allow a definition where the right hand side is “more polymorphic” than the left and depends on some property of a type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can still remember a soundness bug that I introduced into LCF 40 years ago. I was coding 𝛼-conversion: a function to test whether two λ-expressions were equivalent up to renaming of bound variables. For example, $\lambda x.x$ and $\lambda y.y$ are 𝛼-equivalent. But I was coding in LISP and used a popular optimisation of testing for pointer equality, overlooking that it made no sense here. My code regarded $\lambda x.x$ and $\lambda y.x$ as equivalent. This sort of bug is particularly dangerous because it is in the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never heard of any soundness bug in Rocq, but fortunately, the Rocq team maintain a convenient list of critical bugs. It’s scary, and you have to wonder what they did wrong. After all, Lean is based on a similar calculus and seems to have a good soundness record. Another seriously buggy proof assistant is PVS; at least, it was 30 years ago. PVS has no proof kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My impression is that the LCF style systems, including the HOL family as well as Isabelle, have an excellent record for soundness, confirming Robin Milner’s conception from half a century ago – and with no countervailing penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So can we rely on machine proofs?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the woeful tales related above, I am not aware of any that had practical implications. Even soundness bugs seem to have a limited impact. Griffioen and Huisman wrote of PVS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious question thus arises, why use a proof tool that probably contains soundness bugs? … PVS is still a very critical reader of proofs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close examination of almost any proof published in a mathematics journal will identify errors. Most are easy to fix, but the persistence of errors must undermine our confidence in published mathematics. Let’s recall once again that remarkable group of footnotes from The Axiom of Choice, by T J Jech:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exact list was used by DeMillo et al. as evidence for the strength of the mathematical community and decades later, in my own grant proposal, as evidence for its weakness. In the case of machine proofs, with the crucial caveat that abstract models of the real world often turn out to be inadequate, we do not find errors. Evidence from testing suggests that verification works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my corner of the world of interactive theorem proving, we take soundness seriously. Mike Gordon strongly promoted a definitional approach: no axioms ever, all proof developments built upon pure higher-logic from definitions alone, to avoid any danger of inconsistency. Many of the variants of the HOL system owe their existence to a desire for ever greater rigour. For example, John Harrison writes “HOL Light is distinguished by its clean and simple design and extremely small logical kernel.” The HOL light kernel was later verified. The apotheosis of this project is the Candle theorem prover, created by porting HOL Light to the CakeML language. Candle has been proved to correctly implement higher-order logic, and moreover, this theorem has been established for its compiled machine code. We have no way of knowing whether higher-order logic is consistent, but if it isn’t, there will be nothing left of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, higher-order logic is remarkably self-contained. Over past decades, the HOL provers and Isabelle/HOL have gained numerous extensions: recursive datatypes, general recursive function definitions with pattern matching, inductive definitions and coinductive definitions. These are all definable within higher order logic, whereas similar capabilities in dependent type theories always seem to require extensions to the kernel. And that means, any bugs are kernel bugs.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Claude is a space to think&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The nature of AI conversations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Incentive structures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our approach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supporting commerce&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A trusted tool for thought&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We think Claude should work the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click Anywhere to see the faces rotate. Try not to scream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What: The thatcher effect, as you may have just experienced in the interactive examples above, shows that when a face is upside down, but its features (eyes and mouth in this case) are themselves upside down, thus appearing right side up, the brain has a hard time recognizing the face to be tampered with, or wrong at all. This is a great example of how the brain processes faces, and how it can be fooled by simple tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This effect was first documented by Peter Thompson in 1980 [1], and since then has spurred a series of experiments and studies on the topics of facial recognition and the brain’s ability to process faces. My favorite is this [2] paper from 2009, showing that monkeys experience the same effect. This again, does make sense, but the fact that they did the study itself is really the surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How To: Click anywhere on the image to see the faces rotate. Try not to scream. There’s no other special sauce here really, you know what the effect is going to be time and time again, so you can attempt to force your brain to do the calculations, and sometimes it feels like I can get close, but then after the flip, nope, still fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explain It: The brain is good at recognizing faces, and it does so by processing the features of the face in a routine manner, which happens… well, every time you see a face. When a face is shown upside down, the brain can’t really use its same mechanisms but instead will look at the individual features and process them as they are. By all accounts, they tend to look correct (As they would if the face was not upside down), so nothing seems odd at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, this can say a little about how our brain perceives the world around us, but there is without question a lot more to learn in the space, and as such, the studies keep on coming!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've researched these optical illusions in my spare time but am clearly not any kind of expert and my explainations are pretty smooth brained, if you find something mis-cited, earlier examples, or general mistakes please new let me know via toymaker@toms.toys, be kind!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A debilitating infection from the parasitic Guinea worm is inching closer to global eradication, with an all-time low of only 10 human cases reported worldwide in 2025, the Carter Center announced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If health workers can fully wipe out the worms, it will be only the second human disease to be eradicated, after smallpox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis) is a parasitic nematode transmitted in water. More specifically, it’s found in waters that contain small crustacean copepods, which harbor the worm’s larvae. If a person consumes water contaminated with Guinea worm, the parasites burrow through the intestinal tract and migrate through the body. About a year later, a spaghetti noodle-length worm emerges from a painful blister, usually in the feet or legs. It can take up to eight weeks for the adult worm to fully emerge. To ease the searing pain, infected people may put their blistered limbs in water, allowing the parasite to release more larvae and continue the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to being extremely painful, the disease (dracunculiasis) can lead to complications, such as secondary infections and sepsis, which in turn can lead to temporary or permanent disability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Guinea worm eradication program began in 1986, there were an estimated 3.5 million cases across 21 countries in Africa and Asia. To date, only six countries have not been certified by the World Health Organization as Guinea worm-free. In 2024, there were just 15 cases, and, according to the provisional tally for 2025, the number is down to just 10. It’s considered provisional until each country’s disease reports are confirmed, which occurs in a program meeting usually held in April.&lt;/p&gt;

It also provides rare insight into the apparent effectiveness of Lockdown Mode, or at least how effective it might be before the FBI may try other techniques to access the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;💡&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know anything else about phone unlocking technology?

In its standard form, self-attention incurs costs that increase with context length, driving demand for storage, compute, and energy that is now outstripping society's ability to provide them. To help address this issue, we show that self-attention is efficiently computable to arbitrary precision with constant cost per token, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in memory use and computation. We derive our formulation by decomposing the conventional formulation's Taylor expansion into expressions over symmetric chains of tensor products. We exploit their symmetry to obtain feed-forward transformations that efficiently map queries and keys to coordinates in a minimal polynomial-kernel feature basis. Notably, cost is fixed inversely in proportion to head size, enabling application over a greater number of heads per token than otherwise feasible. We implement our formulation and empirically validate its correctness. Our work enables unbounded token generation at modest fixed cost, substantially reducing the infrastructure and energy demands of large-scale Transformer models. The mathematical techniques we introduce are of independent interest.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.LG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A case study in PDF forensics: The Epstein PDFs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 22, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 22, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Peter Wyatt, PDF Association&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recent release of a tranche of files by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) under the “Epstein Files Transparency Act (H.R.4405)” has once again prompted many people to closely examine redacted and sanitized PDF documents. Our previous articles on the Manafort papers and the Mueller report, as well as a study by Adhatarao, S. and Lauradoux, C. (2021) “Exploitation and Sanitization of Hidden Data in PDF Files: Do Security Agencies Sanitize Their PDF files?,” in Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security, illustrate the importance of robust sanitization and redaction workflows when handling sensitive documents prior to release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article examines a small random selection of the Epstein PDF files from a purely digital forensic perspective, focusing on the PDF syntax and idioms they contain, any malformations or unusual constructs, and other technical aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PDFs are more challenging to analyze than many other formats because they are binary files that require specialized knowledge, expertise, and software. Please note that we did not analyze the contents of the PDF documents. Not every PDF was examined. Any mention of products (or appearance in screen-shots) does not imply any endorsement or support of any information, products, or providers whatsoever. We are not lawyers; this article does not constitute legal advice&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We offer this information, in part, as some of the Epstein PDFs released by DoJ are beginning to appear on malware analysis sites (such as Hybrid-Analysis) with various kinds of incorrect analysis and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;26 December 2025 update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After we'd completed our analysis the DoJ released a new dataset, DataSet 8.zip. This new ZIP file is 9.95 GB compressed and contains over 11,000 files, including 10,593 new PDFs totaling 1.8 GB and 29,343 pages (the longest document has 1,060 pages). DataSet 8 also contains many large MP4 movies, Excel spreadsheets, and various other files. The first PDF in the set of 10,593 PDFs is VOL00008\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00009676.pdf, and the last file is VOL00008\IMAGES\0011\EFTA00039023.pdf. A cursory analysis shows pdfinfo properties similar to those from the earlier datasets, but we have not otherwise analyzed this new dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since our original post, various social media and news platforms have also been announcing “recoverable redactions” from the “Epstein Files”. We stand by our analysis; DoJ has correctly redacted the EFTA PDFs in Datasets 01-07, and they do not contain recoverable text as alleged. As our article states, we did not analyze any other DoJ or Epstein-related documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the featured image in this Guardian news article (which was also picked up by the New York Times) corresponds to VOL00004\IMAGES\0001EFTA00005855.pdf, as can be easily determined by searching for the Bates Numbers in the EFTA “.OPT” data files. The information in this EFTA PDF is fully and correctly redacted; there is no hidden information. The only extractable text is some garbled text from the poor-quality OCR and, as expected, the Bates Numbers on each page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the few reports we investigated (including from Forbes and Ed Krassenstein on both X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram), these stories misrepresent other DoJ files that were not part of the major DataSets 01-07 release on December 19 under the EFTA. All PDFs released under EFTA have a Bates Number on every page starting "EFTA". These include “Case 1:22-cv-10904-JSR Document 1-1, Exhibit 1 to Government’s Complaint against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.” (see page 41) and “Case No: ST-20-CV-14 Government Exhibit 1” (see page 19). These PDFs, previously released by the DoJ, do contain incorrect and ineffective redactions, with black boxes that simply obscure text, making “copy &amp;amp; paste” easy to recover the text that's otherwise hidden. Clearly, DoJ processes and systems in the past have inadequately redacted information!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The files we examined&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tranche released by DoJ on Friday, December 19 is available as seven “data sets”, most easily downloaded as seven ZIP archives totaling just under 2.97 GB. Each ZIP file contains a similar folder structure, with DataSet 6 being the odd one out with an extra top-level folder. Once unzipped, the total size is 2.99 GB. The tranche contains 4,085 PDF files, a single AVI (movie) file (located in the folder VOL00002\NATIVES\0001), and 2 data files (.DAT and .OPT) for each ZIP archive. The “.OPT” files appear to be CSV (Comma-Separated Values) but lack a heading row, while the “.DAT” files contain information about the Bates numbering. The analysis we provide here is limited to the PDF files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PDF files are named and ordered sequentially within the folder structure, starting with “EFTA00000001.pdf” in VOL00001 and ending with “EFTA00009664.pdf” in VOL00007, indicating that at least 5,879 PDF files remain unreleased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A random sampling of the PDFs for visual review suggests that they are a mix of single and multi-page full-page photos and scanned content. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was used to provide some searchable and extractable text in at least some files. “Black box” style redactions (without text reasons) are apparent. When done correctly, this is the appropriate way to redact, far more robust than pixelating text. The PDFs we sampled did not include any obviously “born digital” documents. Various news sites are reporting very heavily redacted documents within this tranche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;File validity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A precursor to most forensic examinations is to establish whether the PDF files are technically valid (that is, conform to the rules of the PDF format), since analyzing malformed files can easily lead to incorrect results or wrong conclusions. Combining tools that use different methods provides the broadest possible information while ensuring that tooling limitations are fully understood. However, if the basic file structure or cross-reference information is incorrect, various software might then draw different conclusions and/or construct different Document Object Models (DOMs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to basic file structure, incremental updates (if any), and cross-reference information, PDF validity assessments include the objects that comprise the PDF’sDOM as well as the file structure, incremental updates, and cross-reference information. To assess relationships between objects in the PDF DOM, some forensic analysis tools leverage our Arlington PDF Data Model, while others use their own internal methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our analysis of file validity, using a multitude of PDF forensic tools, identified only one minor defect (invalidity); 109 PDFs had a positive FontDescriptor Descent value rather than a negative one. This is a relatively common (but minor) error, typically associated with font substitution and font matching, that does not affect the validity of the files overall. One specific forensic tool reported a PDF version issue with some files, related to the document catalog Version entry, which prevented the tool from further verifying those specific PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;PDF versions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve previously written about the unreliability of PDF version numbers. Still, for forensic purposes, they may provide insight into the DoJ’s software, and whether improved software could have performed better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used two different but commonly used PDF command-line &lt;code&gt;pdfinfo&lt;/code&gt; utilities on different platforms (Windows and Ubuntu Linux) to summarize information about these PDF files. When run against the full tranche of PDFs, I got two very different sets of answers! Immediately, my spidey senses started to tingle, and I was once again reminded of a key lesson in digital document forensics – you should never trust a single tool!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3,875&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;267&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;TOTAL (should be 4,085)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,085&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,085&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PDF version in the file header, “&lt;code&gt;%PDF-x.y&lt;/code&gt;”, is nominally the first line in every PDF file (based on the not-unreasonable assumption that the PDF files have no “junk bytes” before this PDF file identifier). Using the Linux command line, you can run in Linux “&lt;code&gt;head -n 1 file.pdf&lt;/code&gt;” to extract the first header line from each PDF and compare it with the reported results from each tool. Or run in Linux “&lt;code&gt;grep -P --text --byte-offset "%PDF-\d\.\d" *.pdf&lt;/code&gt;” to confirm that there are no junk bytes prior to the PDF header line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for the difference reported in the table above is that Tool B is not accounting for the Version entry in the document catalog of PDFs with incremental updates. We’ll next investigate whether this is due to malformed files or a programming error. When properly accounting for incremental updates, however, Tool A is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the same &lt;code&gt;pdfinfo&lt;/code&gt; output (and again comparing results from both tools), we can also quickly establish the following facts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF is tagged&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF is encrypted&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF is “optimized” (technically, Linearized PDF)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF has any annotations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF has any outlines (bookmarks)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF contains any embedded files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;None of the PDFs are forms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;None of the PDFs contains JavaScript&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Page counts range from 1 (in 3,818 PDFs) to 119 pages (in two PDFs), totaling 9,659 pages across all 4,085 PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Incremental updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PDF’s incremental updates feature allows multiple revisions of a document to be stored in a PDF file. As the name implies, each set of deltas is appended to the original document, forming a chain of edits. When read by conforming PDF software, a PDF is always processed from the end of the file, effectively applying the deltas to the original document and to any previous incremental updates. Both the original document and each incremental update can be recognized by their respective “&lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt;” and “&lt;code&gt;%%EOF&lt;/code&gt;” markers (assuming that the PDF files are structured correctly).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this investigation, we started by examining the very first PDF in the tranche: VOL00001\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00000001.pdf. This PDF had different PDF versions reported by different versions of &lt;code&gt;pdfinfo&lt;/code&gt;. A simple trick to check if a PDF contains incremental updates is to search for these special markers while treating the PDF as a text file (which it isn’t!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ grep -P --text -–byte-offset "(xref)|(%%EOF)" EFTA00000001.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;371340:xref&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; 371758:startxref&lt;lb/&gt; 371775:%%EOF&lt;lb/&gt; 372977:startxref&lt;lb/&gt; 372994:%%EOF&lt;lb/&gt; 373961:startxref&lt;lb/&gt; 373978:%%EOF&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results (sorted by byte offset) indicate that EFTA00000001.pdf contains two incremental updates after the original file. The lack of an “&lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt;” marker before the last two “&lt;code&gt;startxref&lt;/code&gt;” markers indicate that neither incremental updates uses conventional cross-reference data, but may use cross-reference streams (if any objects are changed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bates numbering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As referenced above, Bates numbering is the process by which every page is assigned a unique identifier. For this tranche of Epstein PDF files, Bates numbers were added to each page via a separate incremental update, as shown below in Visual Studio Code with my pdf-cos-syntax extension. Note that DoJ’s PDFs are primarily text-based internally, making forensic analysis a lot easier - and the files a lot bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2984 is the end-of-file marker for the file version, and line 2985 starts a new incremental update section.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lines 2985-2987 define object 26, the unembedded Helvetica font resource used by the Bates number.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lines 2997-3020 are the modified page object (object 3), replacing the page object in previous revisions of the file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2999 is the page Contents array, comprising five separate content streams, with the 3rd stream (object 29) being the Bates numbering added in this incremental update. Object 30 is an empty content stream that could have been removed by an optimization process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 3034 sets the Helvetica font to 12 point.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 3037 uses a hexadecimal string to paint the Bates number onto the page.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idiom for this final incremental update, which adds the Bates number to every page, appears in all the PDF files we selected at random for investigation. This specific incremental update always uses a cross-reference stream (&lt;code&gt;/Type /XRef&lt;/code&gt;) and relies on the previous incremental update, in which the document catalog Version entry is set to PDF 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The first incremental update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VSCode pdf-cos-syntax extension also indicates (correctly!) that the original PDF is missing the required (when the PDF contains binary data, which most do) comment as the second line of the file that indicates to software that the PDF file needs to be treated as binary data (ISO 32000-2:2020, §7.5.2). Although the missing comment does not make the PDF invalid per se, without such a marker close to the top of each PDF, software may think the PDF is a text file, and thus potentially corrupt the PDF by changing line endings, which would break the byte offsets in the cross-reference data. In this PDF, the first incremental update adds this marker comment after a lot of binary data, which is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the first incremental update changed the document catalog Version entry to PDF 1.5, as we see in this next screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lines 2953-2984 are the incremental update section.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2954 is a PDF comment. PDF comments always start with a PERCENT SIGN (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) and may occur in many places in PDF files. Effective sanitization and redaction workflows typically remove all comments from PDFs because they may inadvertently disclose information, but this exact comment appears in 3,608 other PDF files. The origin or meaning of this comment was not further investigated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2964 upgrades the PDF version to 1.5. At first glance, this may appear to be perfectly valid PDF, but it is technically incorrect because the file header is &lt;code&gt;%PDF-1.3&lt;/code&gt;yet the Version key was only added in PDF 1.4 - this is what the strict file validation tool mentioned above had noticed. As object 24 is a compressed object stream (lines 2966-2973) and object 25 is a compressed cross-reference stream (lines 2974-2981), the indicated version should be PDF 1.5. As a practical matter, however, this level of technical detail does not impact operation or behavior of PDFs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2984 is the end-of-section “&lt;code&gt;%%EOF&lt;/code&gt;” marker for this incremental update section.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As this section of the PDF uses compressed object streams, specialized PDF forensic tools must be used… simple search methodologies, such as those mentioned above, may not identify everything!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that there are 7 objects (because we find /&lt;code&gt;N 7&lt;/code&gt;) inside the object stream:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As per PDF’s specification, ISO 32000-2:2020, §7.5.7, the first line of integers is interpreted as N pairs, where the first integer is the object number and the second integer is the byte offset relative to the first object in the object stream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1st integer (object number)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2nd integer (start offset)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Explanation&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Content&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;19&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;23&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;472&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Array of 2 indirect references (to content streams)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[21 0 R 4 0 R]&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;486&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Updated Page object&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;/Contents 23 0 R/MediaBox[0 0 864 576.75]/Parent 2 0 R/Resources 22 0 R/Thumb 11 0 R/Type/Page&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is very interesting here – from a PDF forensics perspective – is the fact of a hidden document information dictionary that is not referenced from the last (final) incremental update trailer (i.e., there is no Info entry in object 31, lines 3050-3063 below). As such, this orphaned dictionary is invisible to PDF software! This oddity occurs in all other PDFs we’d randomly selected for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Formatted nicely as an uncompressed object, this hidden document information dictionary inside the compressed object stream contains the following information (the CreationDate and ModDate appear to change in other randomly examined PDFs):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;17 0 obj &amp;lt;&amp;lt; /CreationDate (D:20251218143205) /ModDate (D:20251218143205) /Creator (OmniPage CSDK 21.1) /Producer (Processing-CLI) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; endobj&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This metadata clearly indicates the software DoJ used to manipulate these PDF files. Although not relevant to the content, this forensic discovery clearly shows that extra care is required when sanitizing PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Different incremental updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another randomly selected PDF, VOL00003\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00003939.pdf contains 3 full-page images, and just a single incremental update that applies the Bates numbering. However, in this case the file header is &lt;code&gt;%PDF-1.5&lt;/code&gt; yet both the original PDF and incremental update use conventional cross-reference tables! This isn’t problematic, but is certainly unexpected and inefficient since PDF 1.5 introduced compressed cross-reference streams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By comparing the objects in the incremental cross-reference table to the original cross-reference table we can see that objects 66 to 69 – the 3 Page objects for the 3 page document – were redefined. This is just what is expected in order to add the Bates number to each page’s Contents stream as in the previous example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Metadata&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial examination using pdfinfo utilities did not identify any metadata in any of the PDFs in the tranche, either in the document information dictionary (PDF file trailer Info entry) or as an XMP metadata stream (Metadata entry).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, since we know that (a) the tranche includes PDFs with incremental updates, and (b) that an orphaned document information dictionary exists, all revisions of a document should be thoroughly examined. Incremental updates may have marked other document information dictionaries or XMP metadata streams as free but not deleted the actual data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XMP metadata is always encoded in PDF as a stream object, and since stream objects cannot be in compressed object streams, using forensic tools to search for keys “&lt;code&gt;/XML&lt;/code&gt;” or “&lt;code&gt;/Metadata&lt;/code&gt;” should always locate them. All modern office suites and PDF creation applications will generate XMP metadata when exporting to PDF. As XMP is usually uncompressed, searching for XML fragments may also be helpful (see below for an example XMP object fragment).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;3 0 obj &amp;lt;&amp;lt;/Length 36996/Subtype/XML/Type/Metadata&amp;gt;&amp;gt; stream &amp;lt;?xpacket begin="ï»¿" id="W5M0MpCe … zNTczkc9d"?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;x:xmpmeta xmlns:x="adobe:ns:meta/" x:xmptk=" … "&amp;gt; &amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xmp="http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/" ...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not unsurprisingly for properly-redacted files, we did not find any XMP metadata streams or XML in any PDF. As a consequence, none of the PDFs can declare conformance to either PDF/A (ISO 19005 for long-term archiving) or PDF/UA (ISO 14289 for accessibility). Of course, as untagged PDFs, the files cannot conform to accessibility specifications such as PDF/UA or WCAG in any event. Additionally, none of the PDFs appear to include device-independent color spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The presence of an Info entry in the trailer dictionary or (in PDFs with cross-reference streams) in the cross-reference stream dictionary indicates the presence of document information dictionaries. “&lt;code&gt;/Info&lt;/code&gt;” does indeed occur in many of the PDFs, including multiple times in some PDFs, indicating potential changes via incremental updates. However, as discovered above, in some cases the final incremental update does not include an Info entry, thus “orphaning” any existing document information dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ISO 32000-2:2020, Table 349 lists the defined entries in PDF’s document information dictionary (Title, Author, Subject, etc). Any vendor may add additional entries (such as Apple does with its /AAPL:Keywords entry), so redaction and sanitization software should be aware of extra entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From our random sampling, we identified one PDF with a non-trivial document information dictionary still present: VOL00002\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00003212.pdf. This is shown below in Visual Studio Code with my pdf-cos-syntax extension:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of additional interest in this specific PDF is that the comment at line 60 has survived DoJ’s sanitization and redaction workflow! Other PDF comments may therefore also be present in other files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EFTA00003212.pdf appears to be a redacted image or an error from the DoJ workflow, as it is a single page with the text “No Images Produced”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple searching of the standardized PDF document information dictionary entries gives the following (note that the technique used will not locate information in compressed object streams, as mentioned above):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Key name&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Number of PDFs (max. = 4,085)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Comment&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Info&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3,823&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Some PDFs have empty Info dictionaries with no entries&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Title&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;APPL:Keywords&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Date analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detailed date analysis is a common task in the forensic analysis of potentially fraudulent or modified documents. However, in the case of redacted or sanitized documents, where the document is known to have been modified, this can be less useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The creation and modification dates for the 3,609 PDFs range from December 18, 2025, 14:32:05 (2:32 pm) to December 19, 2025, 23:26:13 (almost midnight). For all files, the creation and modification dates are always the same. This may also imply that the DoJ batch processing to prepare this tranche of PDFs took at least 36 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s also interesting is that the CreationDate and ModDate fields in the hidden document information dictionary (inside the object stream of the first increment update – see above) appear to always be an exact match to both the CreationDate and ModDate of the original document. This implies that all dates across all incremental updates were updated in a single processing pass that applied the Bates numbering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Photographs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no JPEG images (DCTDecode filter) in any PDF in the tranche, including the full-page photographs. Randomly viewing the photographic images at high magnification (zoom) in PDF viewers clearly shows JPEG “jaggy” compression artifacts. All photographic images appear to have been downscaled to 96 DPI (769 x 1152 or 1152 x 769 pixels), making text on random objects in the photos much harder to discern (see the OCR discussion below).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DoJ explicitly avoids JPEG images in the PDFs probably because they appreciate that JPEGs often contain identifiable information, such as EXIF, IPTC, or XMP metadata, as well as COM (comment) tags in the JPEG bitstream. This information may disclose the camera model and serial number, GPS location, camera operator details, date/time of the photo, etc., and is more difficult to redact while retaining the JPEG data. The DoJ processing pipeline has therefore explicitly converted all lossy JPEG images to low DPI, FLATE-encoded bitmaps in the PDFs using an indexed device-dependent color space with a palette of 256 unique colors (which reduces the color fidelity compared to the original high-quality digital color photograph).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scanned documents – or are they?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Randomly inspecting the tranche discovers many documents that appear to have been created by a scanning process. On closer inspection, there are documents that have tell-tale artifacts from a physical scanning process, such as visible physical paper edges, punched holes, staple marks, spiral binding, stamps, paper scuff marks, color blotches and inconsistencies, handwritten notes or marginalia, varying paper skew, and platen marks from the physical paper scanning processes. For example, VOL00007\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00009440.pdf shows many of these aspects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also other documents that appear to simulate a scanned document but completely lack the “real-world noise” expected with physical paper-based workflows. The much crisper images appear almost perfect without random artifacts or background noise, and with the exact same amount of image skew across multiple pages. Thanks to the borders around each page of text, page skew can easily be measured, such as with VOL00007\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00009229.pdf. It is highly likely these PDFs were created by rendering original content (from a digital document) to an image (e.g., via print to image or save to image functionality) and then applying image processing such as skew, downscaling, and color reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of the timeless monospaced (also known as fixed-width) “Courier” typeface means that the number of characters redacted can be easily determined by vertical alignment with text lines above and below each redaction. In some instances, this may reduce the possible number of options that represent the redacted content, allowing it to be more easily guessed. Although redaction of variable-width typefaces is far more complex, Bland, M., Iyer, A., and Levchenko, K. 2022 paper “Story Beyond the Eye: Glyph Positions Break PDF Text Redaction” showed that this is still possible with sufficient computing power and determination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optical Character Recognition (OCR)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCR is complex image processing that attempts to identify text in bitmap images. In PDF files, OCR-identified text is commonly placed on top of the image using the invisible text render mode. This enables users to then extract the text from the image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Returning to the very first PDF file in the tranche, VOL00001\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00000001.pdf - this is a full-page photo of a hand-written sign where part of the hand-written information is explicitly redacted. The PDF contains largely inaccurate OCR-ed text, indicating that natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), or even language aware dictionary-based algorithms were not used. This means that there will be more errors in the extracted text than is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With cloud platforms readily accessible and supporting advanced OCR at low cost, anyone is capable of re-processing the entire tranche of PDFs and comparing the OCR results to those provided by DoJ. Even though the page images are low-resolution (96 DPI), rerunning OCR may bring to light additional or corrected information hidden by the original OCR that failed to recognize everything correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “black box” redactions we investigated were all correctly applied directly into the image pixel data. They are not separate PDF rectangle objects simply floating above sensitive information that was still present in the image and easily discoverable. Yes, sometimes it is that easy…!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did not set out to comprehensively analyze every corner of every PDF file in the Epstein PDFs, but to present a basic walk-through of some of the challenges and tricks used to conduct a PDF forensic assessment. Our results above were from a small random sample of documents - there may well be outlier PDFs in the data sets that we did not encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DoJ has clearly created internal processes, systems, and workflows that can sanitize and redact information prior to publishing as PDF. This includes converting JPEG images to low-resolution pixel-only bitmaps, largely removing metadata, and rendering page images to bitmaps. OCR appears to have been widely applied, but is of variable quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their PDF technology could be improved to vastly reduce file size by removing unnecessary objects (e.g., empty content streams, ProcSets, empty thumbnail references, etc.), simplifying and reducing content streams, applying all incremental updates (i.e., removing all incremental update sections), and always using compressed object streams and compressed cross-reference streams. Information leakage may also be occurring via PDF comments or orphaned objects inside compressed object streams, as I discovered above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PDF forensics is a highly complex field, where variations in files and tool assumptions can easily yield false results. The PDF Association hosts a PDF Forensic Liaison Working Group to develop industry guidance on forensic examination of PDF files and to educate document examiners and other specialists about many of these aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Voxtral transcribes &lt;lb/&gt; at the speed of sound.&lt;/head&gt;Try Voxtral Transcribe 2 in Mistral Studio&lt;p&gt; Precision diarization, real-time&lt;lb/&gt; transcription, and a new audio playground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we're releasing Voxtral Transcribe 2, two next-generation speech-to-text models with state-of-the-art transcription quality, diarization, and ultra-low latency. The family includes Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 for batch transcription and Voxtral Realtime for live applications. Voxtral Realtime is open-weights under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're also launching an audio playground in Mistral Studio to test transcription instantly, powered by Voxtral Transcribe 2, with diarization and timestamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlights.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2: State-of-the-art transcription with speaker diarization, context biasing, and word-level timestamps in 13 languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Realtime: Purpose-built for live transcription with latency configurable down to sub-200ms, enabling voice agents and real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best-in-class efficiency: Industry-leading accuracy at a fraction of the cost, with Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 achieving the lowest word error rate, at the lowest price point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open weights: Voxtral Realtime ships under Apache 2.0, deployable on edge for privacy-first applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Voxtral Realtime.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Realtime is purpose-built for applications where latency matters. Unlike approaches that adapt offline models by processing audio in chunks, Realtime uses a novel streaming architecture that transcribes audio as it arrives. The model delivers transcriptions with delay configurable down to sub-200ms, unlocking a new class of voice-first applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word error rate (lower is better) across languages in the FLEURS transcription benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 2.4 seconds delay, ideal for subtitling, Realtime matches Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2, our latest batch model. At 480ms delay, it stays within 1-2% word error rate, enabling voice agents with near-offline accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model is natively multilingual, achieving strong transcription performance in 13 languages, including English, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Russian, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, and Dutch. With a 4B parameter footprint, it runs efficiently on edge devices, ensuring privacy and security for sensitive deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re releasing the model weights under Apache 2.0 on the Hugging Face Hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average diarization error rate (lower is better) across five English benchmarks (Switchboard, CallHome, AMI-IHM, AMI-SDM, SBCSAE) and the TalkBank multilingual benchmark (German, Spanish, English, Chinese, Japanese).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average word error rate (lower is better) across the top-10 languages in the FLEURS transcription benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 delivers significant improvements in transcription and diarization quality across languages and domains. At approximately 4% word error rate on FLEURS and $0.003/min, Voxtral offers the best price-performance of any transcription API. It outperforms GPT-4o mini Transcribe, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Assembly Universal, and Deepgram Nova on accuracy, and processes audio approximately 3x faster than ElevenLabs’ Scribe v2 while matching on quality at one-fifth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enterprise-ready features.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 introduces key capabilities for enterprise deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Speaker diarization.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate transcriptions with speaker labels and precise start/end times. Ideal for meeting transcription, interview analysis, and multi-party call processing. Note: with overlapping speech, the model typically transcribes one speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Context biasing.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide up to 100 words or phrases to guide the model toward correct spellings of names, technical terms, or domain-specific vocabulary. Particularly useful for proper nouns or industry terminology that standard models often miss. Context biasing is optimized for English; support for other languages is experimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Word-level timestamps.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate precise start and end timestamps for each word, enabling applications like subtitle generation, audio search, and content alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Expanded language support.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Realtime, this model now supports 13 languages: English, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Russian, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, and Dutch. Non-English performance significantly outpaces competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Noise robustness.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintains transcription accuracy in challenging acoustic environments, such as factory floors, busy call centers, and field recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Longer audio support.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Process recordings up to 3 hours in a single request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word error rate (lower is better) across languages in the FLEURS transcription benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Audio playground.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test Voxtral Transcribe 2 directly in Mistral Studio. Upload up to 10 audio files, toggle diarization, choose timestamp granularity, and add context bias terms for domain-specific vocabulary. Supports .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .flac, .ogg up to 1GB each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Transforming voice applications.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral powers voice workflows in diverse applications and industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Meeting intelligence.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcribe multilingual recordings with speaker diarization that clearly attributes who said what and when. At Voxtral's price point, annotate large volumes of meeting content at industry-leading cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Voice agents and virtual assistants.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build conversational AI with sub-200ms transcription latency. Connect Voxtral Realtime to your LLM and TTS pipeline for responsive voice interfaces that feel natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Contact center automation.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcribe calls in real time, enabling AI systems to analyze sentiment, suggest responses, and populate CRM fields while conversations are still happening. Speaker diarization ensures clear attribution between agents and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Media and broadcast.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate live multilingual subtitles with minimal latency. Context biasing handles proper nouns and technical terminology that trip up generic transcription services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compliance and documentation.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor and transcribe interactions for regulatory compliance, with diarization providing clear speaker attribution and timestamps enabling precise audit trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both models support GDPR and HIPAA-compliant deployments through secure on-premise or private cloud setups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get started.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 is available now via API at $0.003 per minute.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Product Engineer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Location: NYC (in-person)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help us build everything a consumer brand needs to grow. Weâre just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Youâll be shipping end-to-end product and working directly with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About Converge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to profitably grow the world's consumer brands. That begins with helping them understand which marketing efforts are driving profitable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;200+ consumer brands, including publicly traded companies, rely on Converge to check in on their marketing performance up to a dozen times a day. They drill down to figure out what's working and decide where to shift million-dollar marketing budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ship even more, we've raised $5.7M from some of the best investors, including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, and the founders of Posthog, Algolia, Shipbob, ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What you'll do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ship product fully end-to-end. All the way from designing the system and data models to building out the interface and polishing the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We trust you to build the best solution to a customer's problem. We lead with context and give you full autonomy to design the solution. This means you'll need to build a deep understanding of the problem, obsess over the solution, and ship it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work directly with customers. You'll talk to them, ship, get feedback, and iterate. There are no middlemen. This means you can move incredibly fast: you message a customer, create a PR, and can have it fixed within hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some examples of projects you could own:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effortless Slack conversations: Customers screenshot their Converge reports up to a dozen of times a day (!) to share with the rest of the company. Instead, they should be able to directly tag and message a teammate from any number in Converge and have this synced bidirectionally with Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Centralizing all growth efforts: Converge already centralizes all growth metrics, but the information explaining them is still scattered. We want overlay the context that actually explains trends like pricing updates, budget changes, and promo calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creative analytics: All growth teams use a separate tool to iterate on ad creatives, but they would want to run this workflow on Converge. We should build a Creative Analytics product on top of our data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents: We never wanted to jump on the AI train for the sake of hype. But now that we have the foundations in place, there's huge leverage in building agents that can help growth teams understand their data and act on it more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Converge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're a team of just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Join us if you want to get rid of office politics and just take ownership to get a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though you join early, this job comes with real engineering challenges. We process $4B in online orders annually, 20TB of data flows through Converge each month, and we've collected around 10B customer interactions to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you're shipping will actually get used. 50% of our customers use us daily (!), while this is only 13% for the average SaaS company. You will have an immediate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We love working in-person. You'll like it here if you do too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think you could be a founder, there's no better way to learn than to talk to customers and ship. That's what you'll be spending all of your time on. We obsess over the details and will share honest feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What we're looking for&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong experience working across the stack (4+ YOE). We work with React, Python, Postgres, and Clickhouse. Experience building data-intensive products or familiarity with Clickhouse is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've previously built products or large features fully end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You obsess over the quality of what you're building, both in UX and code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compensation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salary: $175K - $240K + equity (0.6% - 0.85%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Private health, dental, and vision insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pension &amp;amp; 401k contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interview process*&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intro call (30 min): We want to learn about your motivations to join Converge, determine why youâd be a great fit, and answer any questions you have for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical (1h): We work through a typical engineering problem we face at Converge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Culture (45 min): We dive into your past experiences to learn how you like to work and what motivates you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superday (1 day): Join us for a day to actually build something! You get to meet the team, we get to meet you, it's great. (fully paid)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(*) This can all be done in 2 days. If you want to move quickly, we do too. Our founding engineer was on a plane to meet us just days after our first call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We raised $5.7M from some of the best investors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;James Hawkins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nicolas Dessaigne&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Founding team&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Did you knowâ¦&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All co-founders have written code that has run in production as part of Converge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We closed our first publicly traded company during our YC batch from our living room in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thomas and Tiago (Founding Engineer) worked together when Thomas was just an intern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michel (Customer Success) was responsible for most of the incoming Converge Support tickets in his previous job as a freelance tracking consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thomas and Jan were best friends in high school, and Jan and Jerome met in their first year of college.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Launching The Rural Guaranteed Minimum Income Initiative&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been a year since I invited Americans to join us in a pledge to Share the American Dream:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;1. Support organizations you feel are effectively helping those most in need across America right now.&lt;lb/&gt;2. Within the next five years, also contribute public dedications of time or funds towards longer term efforts to keep the American Dream fair and attainable for all our children.&lt;lb/&gt;Stay gold, America. 💛&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I’ve become a big believer in one particular quote, especially considering the specific context in which it was delivered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“From those to whom much is given, much is expected.” — Mary Gates&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those 10 words had a profound effect on the world. Indeed, we were given much, so we, as a family, will choose to give much. On a recent podcast, my partner Betsy said it better than I could have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“Well, we have everything we need!” That’s how I’ve always phrased it to [our children]. That, I think, extends [to our philanthropy]. We have everything we need; how do we make sure everybody has what they need? Because that’s the basic thing — Do you have a comfortable place to live? Do you have enough to eat? Do you have healthcare? If you have the basics, you’re in a good place in life, and everybody should have that opportunity.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a question I’ve asked myself a lot since 2021. When, exactly, is enough?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do have everything we need. Why can’t everyone else have the basic things they need, too?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the $1M to eight nonprofit charities we listed in January 2025, we saw immediate needs becoming so urgent that we quickly added an additional $13M in donations within a few months, for a total of $21M.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Immediate Share The American Dream Donations (~$21M)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Team Rubicon — $1M&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Children’s Hunger Fund — $1M&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PEN America — $1M&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Trevor Project — $1M&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund — $1M + $100k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First Generation Investors — $1M&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global Refuge — $1M&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Planned Parenthood — $1M&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Internet Security Research Group — $1M&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DNA Lounge — $1M&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Murena — $500k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sharewell — $300k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Precious Plastic — $100k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Economic Security Project — $100k&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Alameda Food Bank — $150k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Urban Compassion Project — $75k&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you can’t take a completely short term view and fight each individual fire reactively, as it comes. You'll never stop firefighting. We also have to do fire abatement and deal with the root causes, improving conditions in this country such that there aren’t so many fires. Thus for the second half, much longer term part, in addition to the $21M already donated, we pledged $50M — half of our remaining wealth — to address the underlying, systemic issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I proposed some speculative ideas in “Stay Gold,” and this one ended up being the closest:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;We could found a new organization loosely based on the original RAND Corporation, but modernized like Lever for Change. We can empower the best and brightest to determine a realistic, achievable path toward preserving the American Dream for everyone, working within the current system or outside it.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By March, 2025 we had consensus — The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) is an improved version of the older concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) — rather than indiscriminately giving money to “everyone,” GMI directs the money towards those who most need it, particularly families experiencing generational poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;📢 Please note that after this post, Coding Horror will revert to normal nerdy blog posts, and all future GMI content will be at a dedicated site linked below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why did we decide on GMI?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Almost every existing UBI/GMI study result data we could find indicates cash generally works. For example, OpenResearch data showed the greatest increase in spending among study participants was in meeting basic needs, with the greatest percent increase in support to others (26%), along with huge decreases in reported alcohol use (20% less) and days using non-prescribed painkillers (53% fewer). Why wouldn’t we continue to build something that has generally been shown to work, study after study, time and time again?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is survival money, cash for folks so they can put food on the table, get a roof over their heads, have a functioning vehicle to go to work, and decide how to meet their most basic, critical needs. It pains me to say this, but we live in a world where many people simply do not often experience open generosity, or regular income. When you show someone what it feels like to just not be hungry for a little while, their view of the world changes. They feel trusted. They see possibility.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I moved here with my family. And I have no family up here other than who I brought with me. So, how most people can be like, “Hey, I’m having a hard time. Got $20 or a pack of diapers.” I have nobody up here to do that. So, if me and my husband don't figure it out, it don't get figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So, I’ve got five kids that live with me... I was working full-time until I got pregnant. I prayed for this baby for 10 years. So, as soon as I got pregnant, I stopped working. I was high risk.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The day I got cleared to go back to work, my vehicle broke down. It was the only vehicle that we had that carried all the kids. So, I’ve been four months without my car. So this is also going to get my vehicle back on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You don’t know how hard it is to ask people, hey, can I get a ride to the grocery store? Or, hey, my baby has two month shots. I had to borrow a vehicle. This is gonna... it’s going to do a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unlike many other social programs, GMI studies require initiative. These are opt-in studies that you have to sign up for, demonstrate that you meet the income criteria and are a resident of the county — and because spots are limited, be randomly selected from eligible applicants. We emphasize that this is not passive, it is active teamwork to improve the GMI program with your family, your community, and everyone else we can reach together over the next few decades.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building On What Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The massive OpenResearch UBI study, the largest and most detailed guaranteed income study ever conducted in the USA, was designed to be a template for future, more refined studies, and that’s exactly what we’re doing. We will also use what we learn in this group of three counties — as in software, the rule of three — to iterate, adapt, and improve our GMI study playbook with every new group of three counties, generating a playbook anyone can use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We strive to do repeatable, replicable science in every study, and all our data will be open and freely shared with the world. We’re contributing to — and partially funding — a global, open data repository for basic income pilots all around the world, UBIdata. It’s the same reason we made Stack Overflow content part of the creative commons, and Discourse fully open source.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GMI is seed funding for families, investing in our fellow Americans, those who need it the most. A large body of research shows that dollars targeted to lower-income families are more likely to be spent quickly and reduce hardship, and can improve outcomes for children. “Trickle up” economics works, whereas "trickle down" tax cuts for the rich increase income inequality and provide no significant effect on growth or jobs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is the newer trust based model of philanthropy, much closer to venture capital funding. We primarily empower, fund, and build up existing organizations like GiveDirectly and OpenResearch, forming a collaborative team to leverage all their existing work and grow their organizations in whatever way they see fit, because they have the most experience in the GMI space.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Rural Guaranteed Minimum Income Initiative&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like to go that way, really fast, so we are already well underway with the Rural Guaranteed Minimum Income Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We focus on rural counties, where dollars go a lot further, poverty is more prevalent, and populations are smaller for tighter studies. Rural counties are also greatly overlooked in this country, in my opinion, yet they have so much incredible untapped talent. I know because that’s exactly where my parents and I are from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve funded three county level programs (Mercer, WV; Beaufort, NC; Warren, MS) that are already underway, where we will help lift thousands of people out of poverty for a period of 16 months, while sharing data and results with the world. That’s a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think we can do considerably more. With your help, we hope to reach all 50 states over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Stay Gold,” I noted that all of American history contains the path of love, and the path of hate. But the path of love is the only survivable path. It’s so much harder, and it’s going to be a lifetime of work. But what else could I possibly buy with our money that would be worth anything close to this, for all of us?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone is invited to help. Share results, learn the history of GMI (it’s actually fascinating, I swear), talk to your representatives and generally spread the word. A surprising number of people have never even heard the terms UBI or GMI, and sometimes have misconceptions about what they are and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you, or someone you know, is “those to whom much is given,” and in a position to sponsor county-scale work, please join us in bringing a GMI study to a new rural county and reach all 50 states. Let’s continue to do science and help lift thousands of people out of poverty while generating open data for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my third and final startup. Rather than an “Atwood Foundation,” all we want to do is advance the concept of direct cash transfer. Simply giving money to those most in need is perhaps the most radical act of love we can take on... and all the data I can find shows us that it works — helping people afford basic needs, keep stable housing, and handle unexpected expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dreams, like happiness, are only real when shared. So let’s do that together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fastmail Donates USD 10,000 to The Perl and Raku Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025 was a tough year for The Perl and Raku Foundation (TPRF). Funds were sorely needed. The community grants program had been paused due to budget constraints and we were in danger of needing to pause the Perl 5 core maintenance grants. Fastmail stepped up with a USD 10,000 donation and helped TPRF to continue to support Perl 5 core maintenance. Ricardo Signes explains why Fastmail helped keep this very important work on track.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perl has served us quite well since Fastmail’s inception. We’ve built up a large code base that has continued to work, grow, and improve over twenty years. We’ve stuck with Perl because Perl stuck with us: it kept working and growing and improving, and very rarely did those improvements require us to stop the world and adapt to onerous changes. We know that kind of stability is, in part, a function of the developers of Perl, whose time is spent figuring out how to make Perl better without also making it worse. The money we give toward those efforts is well-spent, because it keeps the improvements coming and the language reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;— Ricardo Signes, Director &amp;amp; Chief Developer Experience Officer, Fastmail&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that you don’t hear about Perl in the headlines is its reliability. Upgrading your Perl from one version to the next? That can be a very boring deployment. You code worked before and it continues to “just work” after the upgrade. You don’t need to rant about short deprecation cycles, performance degradation or dependencies which no longer install. The Perl 5 core maintainers take great care to ensure that you don’t have to care very much about upgrading your Perl. Backwards compatibility is top of mind. If your deployment is boring, it’s because a lot of care and attention has been given to this matter by the people who love Perl and love to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we moved to secure TPRF’s 2025 budget, we reached out to organizations which rely on Perl. A number of these companies immediately offered to help. Fastmail has already been a supporter of TPRF for quite some time. In addition to this much needed donation, Fastmail has been providing rock solid free email hosting to the foundation for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Fastmail’s donation has been allocated towards Perl 5 Core maintenance, TPRF is now in the position to re-open the community grants program, funding it with USD 10,000 for 2026. There is also an opportunity to increase the community grants funding if sponsor participation increases. As we begin our 2026 fundraising, we are looking to cast a wider net and bring more sponsor organizations on board to help support healthy Perl and Raku ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe your organization will be the one to help us double our community grants budget in 2026. To become a sponsor, contact: olaf@perlfoundation.org&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anxiety is the second leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Roughly a third of adults in the United States will experience an anxiety disorder within their lifetime, and the median age of onset is 17 years old. Anxiety increases the risk for multiple other problematic outcomes, including depression and suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While social media can be a cause of anxiety, it can also be a potential solution. A researcher at the University of Arkansas recently found that young adults who receive emotional support on social media are significantly more likely to report reduced anxiety symptoms, with a few specific personality traits reporting the most improved well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the study's findings was that people with high openness to experience, high extraversion, high agreeableness and low conscientiousness reported an increase in perceived social media emotional support. Positive interactions and perceptions may explain why young adults with these specific traits feel more supported and less anxious overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Longitudinal studies demonstrate an association between social media use and anxiety," the researchers noted in a paper published in Psychiatry International. "However, the mechanism of this association in terms of emotional support is not completely understood. This new study addressed these important research questions, finding strong and linear associations of reduced anxiety, especially among females."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was co-authored by Renae Merrill, a lecturer in the Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences at the U of A, and Chunhua Cao, an assistant professor in the College of Education at the University of Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The national sample was comprised of more than 2,403 U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 30. Anxiety was measured using the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System scale. Emotional support was measured by asking participants how much support they receive on popular social media platforms, and personality was measured using the Big Five Inventory, which assesses openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The findings from this research have important social implications, given the increased prevalence of anxiety among young adults," the researchers noted. "We currently know that anxiety also increases the risk of stress-induced inflammation, sleep disruption, migraine headaches, negative workplace culture, maladaptive perfectionism, low self-esteem and negatively impacting academic performance."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, study cannot determine the direction of the association. For example, social media emotional support may lower anxiety or anxiety may lower perceived social media emotional support. It does suggest gender differences in how social media emotional support is perceived. The results also suggests that emotional support is effective in improving mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"People thrive when they feel valued, supported and part of a cohesive group," Merrill explained. "Becoming more emotionally aware in our interactions with others is essential. This involves taking the time to really understand what others are going through and offering positive meaningful support as much as possible. Improving perception, communication and emotional awareness both in person and on social media platforms is integral for improving health and well-being."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research support was received by the Fine Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
