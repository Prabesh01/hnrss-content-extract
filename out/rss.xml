    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Titans + MIRAS: Helping AI have long-term memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 4, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ali Behrouz, Student Researcher, Meisam Razaviyayn, Staff Researcher, and Vahab Mirrokni, VP and Google Fellow, Google Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We introduce the Titans architecture and the MIRAS framework, which allow AI models to work much faster and handle massive contexts by updating their core memory while it's actively running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Transformer architecture revolutionized sequence modeling with its introduction of attention, a mechanism by which models look back at earlier inputs to prioritize relevant input data. However, computational cost increases drastically with sequence length, which limits the ability to scale Transformer-based models to extremely long contexts, such as those required for full-document understanding or genomic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research community explored various approaches for solutions, such as efficient linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and state space models (SSMs) like Mamba-2. These models offer fast, linear scaling by compressing context into a fixed-size. However, this fixed-size compression cannot adequately capture the rich information in very long sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In two new papers, Titans and MIRAS, we introduce an architecture and theoretical blueprint that combine the speed of RNNs with the accuracy of transformers. Titans is the specific architecture (the tool), and MIRAS is the theoretical framework (the blueprint) for generalizing these approaches. Together, they advance the concept of test-time memorization, the ability of an AI model to maintain long-term memory by incorporating more powerful “surprise” metrics (i.e., unexpected pieces of information) while the model is running and without dedicated offline retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MIRAS framework, as demonstrated by Titans, introduces a meaningful shift toward real-time adaptation. Instead of compressing information into a static state, this architecture actively learns and updates its own parameters as data streams in. This crucial mechanism enables the model to incorporate new, specific details into its core knowledge instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Titans: Learning new context on the fly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An effective learning system requires distinct yet interconnected memory modules, mirroring the human brain's separation of short-term and long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While attention mechanisms excel for precise, short-term memory, Titans introduces a novel neural long-term memory module, that, unlike the fixed-size vector or matrix memory in traditional RNNs, acts as a deep neural network (specifically, a multi-layer perceptron). This memory module provides significantly higher expressive power, allowing the model to summarize large volumes of information without losing important context. The model isn't simply taking notes; it's understanding and synthesizing the entire story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, Titans doesn’t just passively store data. It actively learns how to recognize and retain important relationships and conceptual themes that connect tokens across the entire input. A key aspect of this ability is what we call the “surprise metric”. In human psychology, we know we quickly and easily forget routine, expected events but remember things that break the pattern — unexpected, surprising, or highly emotional events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the context of Titans, the "surprise metric" is the model detecting a large difference between what it currently remembers and what the new input is telling it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low surprise: If the new word is "cat" and the model's memory state already expects an animal word, the gradient (surprise) is low. It can safely skip memorizing the word "cat" in its permanent long-term state.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High surprise: If the model's memory state is summarizing a serious financial report, and the new input is a picture of a banana peel (the unexpected event), the gradient (surprise) will be very high. This signals that the new input is important or anomalous, and it must be prioritized for permanent storage in the long-term memory module.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model uses this internal error signal (the gradient) as a mathematical equivalent of saying, "This is unexpected and important!" This allows the Titans architecture to selectively update its long-term memory only with the most novel and context-breaking information, keeping the overall process fast and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Titans refines this mechanism by incorporating two critical elements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Momentum: The model considers both "momentary surprise" (the current input) and "past surprise" (the recent context flow). This ensures relevant subsequent information is also captured, even if those tokens are not individually surprising.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forgetting (weight decay): To manage the finite capacity of the memory when dealing with extremely long sequences, Titans employ an adaptive weight decay mechanism. This acts as a forgetting gate, allowing the model to discard information that is no longer needed.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MIRAS: A unified view of sequence modeling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every major breakthrough in sequence modeling — from modern transformers to the new, lightning-fast linear RNNs — is essentially the same thing under the hood: a highly complex associative memory module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, what makes MIRAS both unique and practical is the way it views AI modeling. Instead of seeing diverse architectures, it sees different methods of solving the same problem: efficiently combining new information with old memories without letting the essential concepts be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIRAS defines a sequence model through four key design choices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory architecture: The structure that stores information (e.g., a vector, matrix, or a deep multi-layer perceptron, like in Titans).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attentional bias: The internal learning objective the model optimizes that determines what it prioritizes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Retention gate: The memory regularizer. MIRAS reinterprets "forgetting mechanisms" as specific forms of regularization that balance new learning against retaining past knowledge.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory algorithm: The optimization algorithm used to update the memory.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Transcending the mean squared error paradigm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Virtually all successful existing sequence models rely on mean squared error (MSE) or dot-product similarity for both their bias and retention. This reliance can make models sensitive to outliers and limit their expressive power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIRAS transcends this limitation by providing a generative framework to explore a more rich design space informed by the literature in optimization and statistics. This allows for the creation of novel architectures with non-Euclidean objectives and regularization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using MIRAS, we created three specific attention-free models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;YAAD: We designed this MIRAS variant to be less sensitive to major errors or "outliers" (like a single typo in a large document). It uses a gentler math penalty (Huber loss) for mistakes, so it doesn't overreact to one-off issues. This makes the model more robust when the input data is messy or inconsistent.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MONETA: This model explores the use of more complex and strict mathematical penalties (called generalized norms). It investigates whether using these more disciplined rules for both what the model attends to and what it forgets can lead to a more powerful and stable long-term memory system overall.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MEMORA: This model focuses on achieving the best possible memory stability by forcing its memory to act like a strict probability map. By using this constraint, it ensures that every time the memory state is updated, the changes are controlled and balanced. This guarantees a clean, stable process for integrating new information.Virtually all successful existing sequence models rely on mean squared error (MSE) or dot-product similarity for both their bias and retention. This reliance can make models sensitive to outliers and limit their expressive power.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experiments and results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We rigorously compared Titans along with MIRAS variants (YAAD, MONETA, MEMORA) against leading architectures, including Transformer++, Mamba-2, and Gated DeltaNet. We further validated versatility by testing Titans on genomic modeling (DNA) and time-series forecasting, proving the architecture generalizes effectively beyond text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across both standard language modeling datasets (C4, WikiText) and zero-shot reasoning tasks (HellaSwag, PIQA), our models consistently demonstrated higher accuracy and perplexity (a measure of how surprised an LLM is when looking at a piece of text).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The power of deep memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ablation studies clearly show that the depth of the memory architecture is crucial. When comparing long-term memory modules of the same size but different depths, modules with deeper memories consistently achieve lower perplexity in language modeling. Furthermore, they exhibit better scaling properties, maintaining performance as the sequence length increases significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Language modeling and efficiency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In language modeling and commonsense reasoning tasks, Titans architectures outperform state-of-the-art linear recurrent models (such as Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet) and Transformer++ baselines of comparable sizes. The novel MIRAS variants (MONETA, YAAD, MEMORA) also achieve improved performance compared to these baselines, validating the benefit of exploring robust, non-MSE optimization mechanisms. Importantly, these models maintain efficient, parallelizable training and fast linear inference speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Extreme long-context recall&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most significant advantage of these new architectures is their ability to handle extremely long contexts. This is highlighted in the BABILong benchmark, a task requiring reasoning across facts distributed in extremely long documents. In this challenging setting, Titans outperforms all baselines, including extremely large models like GPT-4, despite having many fewer parameters. Titans further demonstrates the capability to scale effectively to context window sizes larger than 2 million tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The introduction of Titans and the MIRAS framework marks a significant advancement in sequence modeling. By employing deep neural networks as memory modules that learn to memorize as data is coming in, these approaches overcome the limitations of fixed-size recurrent states. Furthermore, MIRAS provides a powerful theoretical unification, revealing the connection between online optimization, associative memory, and architectural design. By moving beyond the standard Euclidean paradigm, this research opens the door to a new generation of sequence models that combine the efficiency of RNNs with the expressive power needed for the era of long-context AI.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programs running in windowing environments, applications as we used to know them, have more complicated requirements than those run from a command line. Rather than embed all the resources they require for windows, menus and the rest in a single file, Mac OS broke new ground by putting those into resources stored in the app’s resource fork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is QuarkXPress version 4.11 from around 2000, with its resources displayed in the resource editor ResEdit. Executable code was also stored in CODE resources, and every file contained type and creator information to support the illusions created by the Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Mac OS X was designed, it switched to the bundle structure inherited from NeXTSTEP. Instead of this multitude of resources, apps consisted of a hierarchy of directories containing files of executable code, and those with what had in Mac OS been supporting resources. Those app bundles came to adopt a standard form, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bundle name has the extension .app, and contains a single directory Contents. Within that, the executable code is in the MacOS directory, which may contain both the main executable for the GUI app and any bundled command tools provided. Another directory contains Resources, including the app’s custom icon, and components of its GUI. In some apps, there’s another directory of Frameworks containing dylibs (libraries).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also two important files, Info.plist and PkgInfo. The latter contains the same type and creator information inherited from Classic Mac OS, and apparently isn’t mandatory although it appears universal. The information property list is essential, as it specifies the names of the executable and its icon file in Resources, the minimum version of macOS required, type declarations of the app’s documents, version numbers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When running a command tool in macOS, its Mach-O executable is launched by &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt;, whose purpose is to run code. Launching an app is more demanding, although the app’s executable is still launched by &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt;. Before that can happen, macOS starts the launch process using LaunchServices and RunningBoard, which rely on information obtained from Info.plist and other components in the app bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;macOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This structure remained stable until the introduction of code signatures in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in 2007. Accommodating those added a directory named _CodeSignature containing the signature in a CodeResources file. That includes code directory hashes (CDHashes) to check the integrity of the contents of the app bundle. Apps distributed by the App Store include a store receipt in another directory, _MASReceipt. Since 2018, when Apple introduced notarization, the ‘ticket’ issued by Apple can be ‘stapled’ into the app bundle as the file CodeResources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many apps come with additional items that might in the past have been installed by them in their Library/Application Support folders and elsewhere, but are now included in the app bundle. These can include the following directories:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Library, containing folders of LaunchDaemons and LoginItems that would previously have been installed in either the main Library folder, or that in the user’s Home folder;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;XPCServices, for executable code that the app uses to provide specific services;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plugins, for some types of app extension (Appex);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extensions, for other types of app extension, including app intents.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may also come across other components, including a version.plist in Apple’s apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This centralisation of components in the app bundle has brought several benefits. Being self-contained, apps are easier to install and update, and cleaner to remove. Their components are less likely to go missing, and most of all they’re held within the protection of the app’s signature and notarisation, an important improvement in security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assembling these into a diagram shows how the anatomy of an app has grown over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Components shown in pale yellow are either mandatory or essentially universal. Those shown in green are found in apps distributed through the App Store, while that shown in blue is the stapled notarisation ticket (optional). You will also see additional folders and components such as Automator workflows, scripts, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no difference in structure between apps built for current Intel and Arm architectures. That’s because binaries in the MacOS folder (and executable code in other directories like Frameworks, XPCServices and Plugins) contain platform-specific code in a single Mach-O executable. Thus, an app that’s Universal and runs native on both architectures includes code for both in its single ‘fat’ code file, and they even have separate signatures stored within common files.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Goodbye, Microsoft: Schleswig-Holstein relies on Open Source and saves millions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schleswig-Holstein saves 15 million euros in license costs by migrating from Microsoft to free software. The conversion is significantly cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state administration of Schleswig-Holstein is making a remarkable U-turn in its IT strategy and consistently relying on open source. After the migration from proprietary Microsoft software to free solutions was initially accompanied by problems and criticism, Digitalization Minister Dirk Schrödter (CDU) can now report a significant success: According to his ministry, the state will save over 15 million euros in license costs for Windows, Microsoft Office &amp;amp; Co. next year alone. It is expected to be similar in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, there would be one-time investments of nine million euros in 2026, explained the Ministry of Digitalization to the Kieler Nachrichten. These would have to be made for the conversion of workplaces and the further development of solutions with free software in the next 12 months. Given the annual savings, this sum will pay for itself in less than a year. In the past, the state transferred millions to the US company Microsoft, primarily for the use of office software and other programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The department sees the departure from this "vendor lock-in" – the dependence on a single large provider – as a clear signal for greater independence and sustainable digitalization. The financial incentive now underscores that digital sovereignty can be not only a political buzzword but also an economic gain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Almost 80 percent of licenses canceled&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The numbers speak for themselves: outside the tax administration, almost 80 percent of workplaces in the state administration have already been switched to the open-source office software LibreOffice. Schrödter thus confirms a course that reduces technical and economic dependence on individual manufacturers. The consequence of the conversion was already evident recently, as Schrödter emphasized in an interview with c't. Regarding the status of Microsoft license cancellations, he said: "We are at almost 80, without the tax administration." For tax matters, the state finance ministers have "given themselves a clear timetable for the switch." Recently, the Christian Democrat also emphasized, according to the Südtiroler Wirtschaftszeitung, that the state has entered a marathon, not just a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining 20 percent of workplaces are currently still dependent on Microsoft programs such as Word or Excel, as there is a technical dependency on these programs in certain specialized applications. According to Schrödter, however, the successive conversion of these remaining computers is the stated goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Opposition sees challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the savings and the almost completed migration in large parts of the administration, the opposition continues to criticize the quality of the conversion. SPD state parliament member Kianusch Stender pointed out to the Kieler Nachrichten: "It may be that on paper 80 percent of workplaces have been converted. But far fewer than 80 percent of employees can now work with them properly." Errors in the migration are "still present." The initial difficulties in introducing the open-source programs have apparently led to ongoing frustration among some employees in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Videos by heise&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Green state parliament member Jan Kürschner also admitted in an interview with heise online that such a comprehensive conversion would not go without friction. But he emphasized the long-term nature of the project and the necessity of fundamentally rethinking administrative processes: "With the change, there is an opportunity to truly rethink the administration and free ourselves from old burdens. That is the great added value." If only a one-to-one conversion is made, it might certainly "stumble at one point or another." But those who truly optimize administrative processes will likely find in the end: "Open source is the better way."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge now is to resolve the initial migration problems and acceptance difficulties and to further develop the open-source solutions so that they fully meet the requirements of a modern state administration. The savings achieved give Schleswig-Holstein more financial leeway for this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield walked into a Family Dollar store in Windsor, North Carolina, carrying a scanner gun and a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut growers and poultry workers, Coffield scanned 300 items and recorded their shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as item after item rang up at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red Baron frozen pizzas, listed on the shelf at $5, rang up at $7.65. Bounty paper towels, shelf price $10.99, rang up at $15.50. Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, Stouffer’s frozen meatloaf, Sprite and Pepsi, ibuprofen, Klondike Minis – shoppers were overpaying for all of them. Pedigree puppy food, listed at $12.25, rang up at $14.75.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All told, 69 of the 300 items came up higher at the register: a 23% error rate that exceeded the state’s limit by more than tenfold. Some of the price tags were months out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The January 2023 inspection produced the store’s fourth consecutive failure, and Coffield’s agency, the state department of agriculture &amp;amp; consumer services, had fined Family Dollar after two previous visits. But North Carolina law caps penalties at $5,000 per inspection, offering retailers little incentive to fix the problem. “Sometimes it is cheaper to pay the fines,” said Chad Parker, who runs the agency’s weights-and-measures program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dollar-store industry, including Family Dollar and its larger rival, Dollar General, promises everyday low prices for household essentials. But an investigation by the Guardian found that the prices listed on the shelves at these two chains often don’t materialize at checkout – in North Carolina and around the country. As the cost of living soars across America, the customers bearing the burden are those who can least afford it – customers who often don’t even notice they’re overpaying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These overcharges are widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022, a Guardian review found. Family Dollar stores have failed more than 2,100 price inspections in 20 states over the same time span, the review found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among these thousands of failed inspections, some of the biggest flops include a 76% error rate in October 2022 at a Dollar General in Hamilton, Ohio; a 68% error rate in February 2023 at a Family Dollar in Bound Brook, New Jersey; and a 58% error rate three months ago at a Family Dollar in Lorain, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the stores that failed state or local government checks were repeat violators. A Family Dollar in Provo, Utah, flunked 28 inspections in a row – failures that included a 48% overcharge rate in May 2024 and a 12% overcharge rate in October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chains’ pricing disparities are drawing increasing attention. In May, Arizona’s attorney general announced a $600,000 settlement to resolve a consumer-fraud investigation against Family Dollar. In October, Colorado’s attorney general settled with Dollar General for $400,000 after its stores failed 15 out of 23 state inspections. Dollar General has also settled with New Jersey, Vermont and Wisconsin, and both companies have settled with Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linda Davis, a 64-year-old Family Dollar shopper in Dayton, Ohio, called the state attorney general’s office in February after walking home from the dollar store and discovering that 12 of her 23 purchases had rung up incorrectly. “I’m adding it up in my head as I’m shopping,” she told the Guardian. “But I was way off and I didn’t know why … I thought: where did I miscalculate? I’ve [only] got so much cash on me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Davis, who lives on social security, said she could shop elsewhere, but that would involve paying for a bus ride. “I don’t have money like that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Family Dollar and Dollar General declined interview requests and did not answer detailed lists of questions from the Guardian. Instead, both sent the Guardian brief statements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At Family Dollar, we take customer trust seriously and are committed to ensuring pricing accuracy across our stores,” the company said. “We are currently reviewing the concerns raised and working to better understand any potential discrepancies. We continue to be focused on providing a consistent and transparent shopping experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General said it was “committed to providing customers with accurate prices on items purchased in our stores, and we are disappointed any time we fail to deliver on this commitment”. In one court case in Ohio, Dollar General’s lawyers argued that “it is virtually impossible for a retailer to match shelf pricing and scanned pricing 100% of the time for all items. Perfection in this regard is neither plausible nor expected under the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Guardian’s examination of inspection failures by the two chains was based on record requests to 45 states and more than 140 counties and cities in New York, Ohio and California, along with court documents and public databases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In nearly half of US states, information about whether customers are being overcharged was limited or unavailable. Many states do little or nothing to monitor retail stores’ pricing practices. Some, like Maryland, Idaho and Washington, do no random inspections, responding only to consumer complaints. Illinois, South Carolina and others don’t inspect at all. In 2020, auditors in Kansas revealed that these inspections were a low priority in many states. “Consumers can check price accuracy themselves,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in states with tougher enforcement, financial penalties don’t always solve the problem: in the 23 months after Dollar General agreed in November 2023 to pay Wisconsin $850,000, its stores failed 31% of their price inspections. During the same period, Wisconsin’s Family Dollar stores failed 30% of their state inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to industry watchers, employees and lawsuits, overcharges often stem from labor practices within the dollar-store sector. When a company changes prices, the registers are updated automatically. But the shelf prices are not: someone needs to remove the old labels manually and replace them with new ones. In an industry known for minimal staffing, workers don’t always have time to put up the new shelf tags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many instances, customers may not notice that they are being charged more than what’s listed on the shelf. If they notice at the register, they may decide to put those items back – or ask a store employee to honor the shelf price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General, in its statement, said its store teams “are empowered to correct the matter on the spot”. But customers and current and former employees said that while some dollar stores will correct the price, others refuse to make fixes at the register – and turn away customers who return later and request a refund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Overcharging even by a small amount per item can strain a really tight budget,” said Elizabeth M Harris, acting director of the New Jersey division of consumer affairs. “If you’ve ever gone into any store … with a child like I have, there’s chaos at the checkout counter and you’re not really paying attention.” With items being rung up quickly, she added, “consumers are trusting that the retailer is actually charging them the price that’s displayed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her state settled in 2023 with Dollar General for $1.2m after finding more than 2,000 items rung up as overcharges across 58 stores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if the overcharges paid by dollar-store customers are accidental, they still reflect the industry’s decision not to correct a problem it has known about for years, according to Kennedy Smith, a researcher at the non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which works to protect communities from negative impacts of big corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If they’re called on it, they’ll say, ‘Oh yeah, our mistake,’” Kennedy said. “Until they’re called on it, they’re happy to let those scanner errors bring in the millions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘The cheap stuff’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When consumers feel economic pain, as they do now thanks to rising costs exacerbated by tariffs, price gouging and other inflationary pressures, one place they turn to are dollar stores. These one-stop centers for inexpensive food, clothing and housewares tend to sell in small quantities, one $1 chicken-noodle-soup can at a time. And they are relatively easy to get to: 75% of Americans live within 5 miles of a Dollar General, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry’s largest player is flourishing. Todd Vasos, the CEO of Dollar General, told investors in August that his company’s quarterly sales had increased 5% over the same period last year. Some of that growth, he said, came from middle- and higher-income shoppers tightening their belts. But the company’s low-income “core customers” were spending more at the chain too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those customers have been the industry’s niche from the beginning. When a 48-year-old former tobacco farmer and traveling salesman named James Luther Turner opened JL Turner and Son Wholesale Dry Goods, Shoes, Notions and Hosiery in Scottsville, Kentucky, in 1939, his mission was “to sell the cheap stuff to the poor folks”. (Someone else had cornered the market on “selling the good stuff” to Scottsville’s rich folks.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1955, Turner and his eldest son, Hurley Calister “Cal” Turner Sr, were overseeing 36 stores in small southern towns. Cal Sr decided that year to co-opt the “Dollar Days” sales at big department stores and to open outlets featuring a single low price of $1. Adopting a name that nodded to the general store, he designed a bold black-and-yellow sign and that June christened the first Dollar General in Springfield, Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General now operates over 20,000 stores in 48 states – more than any other retailer of any kind in the US. (It has long since abandoned its $1 price limit.) Though it has more than 195,000 employees and net sales of $40.6bn, the company still calls itself “America’s neighborhood general store”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Family Dollar began in 1959 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and now operates 8,000 stores nationwide. For most of the past decade, it was owned by yet another chain, Dollar Tree, but the two brands divorced last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Dollar General and Family Dollar have in common is a conspicuous presence in places that don’t offer a lot of other retail: low-income urban neighborhoods and rural towns like Windsor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A predominantly Black county seat of 3,400 on North Carolina’s coastal plain, Windsor used to be a retail hub. “All the streets were full on a weekend,” recalled Russell Parker, a 66-year-old retired pilot. “There were people everywhere, people playing music.” And people spending money: at the fish market, the cobbler, the independent groceries, the automotive-supply store. But today Windsor’s downtown – like many rural main streets – is pocked with empty storefronts. The town never fully recovered from Hurricane Floyd, in 1999. “Every young person that graduates from high school gets on the first thing smokin’ to somewhere else,” Parker said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One supermarket remains on the edge of town. Shopping for clothes often means driving to the next county, at least for those who drive. But Windsor does have three stores that help fill the gap: a Dollar General and two Family Dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the Family Dollar that failed multiple inspections, some regulars remain vigilant. Chris Outlaw, a 54-year-old hemodialysis technician, shops there because it’s near his house and workplace. Experience has taught him to buy only a few items at once and to examine his receipts. Not all his neighbors do the same. “I’ve seen people in there with baskets full,” he said. “You can just imagine how much of that stuff didn’t ring out right, and they had so much they couldn’t catch it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘Big old savings’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customers walking into Dollar General stores are often greeted by a bright yellow sign blaring “Hello, Low Prices”– and by as many as 10,000 items cramming shelves and, often, cluttering the aisles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They will send you more than what you need of any product,” said Stephanie, a former lead sales associate in Louisiana. “Your shelf can only hold 10 Glade air fresheners, right? But they will send you 50.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rarely is there enough staffing, current and former employees say, to complete all of the tasks expected of them, including stocking shelves, ringing up sales, looking out for shoplifters, mopping floors – and updating price changes and sales stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than two dozen current and former employees of the chain in 15 states interviewed by the Guardian agreed that price discrepancies are the byproduct of the company’s employment policies. (Most, including Stephanie, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often there are only one or two people on duty. “You’re lucky if you get to work two to four hours of your eight- to 13-hour shift with another human being,” a former assistant manager in Illinois said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every Tuesday, employees are supposed to print and post hundreds of shelf stickers representing price changes already updated in the computer system. On Saturdays, stacks of sales stickers arrive; often, workers are expected to remove all the previous week’s stickers by 5pm and put up new stickers – as many as 1,000 of them – before closing up that night. Stickers fail to get put up, they fall off easily, and they are confusing, with some sales instant and others linked to coupons. “I threw away tags sometimes, to keep me or a co-worker out of trouble,” Stephanie admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A former store manager at a Dollar General in Connecticut noted that many of his customers were poor or disabled enough that they got by on public assistance. “I didn’t want people to get screwed over, but I knew that it was happening,” he said. “If I’m in the store, I’m gonna try to do the best I can for them. But at the end of the day, they’re still probably gonna get overcharged for a few things.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General, in its statement, said it schedules time each week for “price change execution”, among other measures to ensure accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten current and former employees in eight states claimed that – along with allowing pricing errors caused by understaffing and overstocking – some Dollar General stores engage in a tactic designed to fool customers: special sales that don’t actually lower the price of an item. A manager from Florida, for example, sent the Guardian two photos of price stickers for Café Bustelo ground coffee. In the first photo, a sticker said “SALE” in white block letters against a red background. It advertised a markdown from $7.95 to $6.50. In the second photo, the top sticker had been peeled away to show the original price: $6.50.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A sales associate from Illinois sent photos showing cutlery with what he said was a fake original price of $8.50. “It’s trying to say that you’re making this big old savings by buying this item here,” explained the employee, “when it’s actually always been $6.95.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General declined to comment on these workers’ claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘We have little choice’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Ohio attorney general, Dave Yost, sued Dollar General in 2022, he submitted 114 pages of customer complaints as part of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of them came from Melanie Hutzler, who lives in Canton without a car and whose mobility is limited by arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Hutzler, 51, relies on government food assistance and said she was cautious about spending money. At the time of her complaint, she could reach two food stores on foot. Getting to the Save A Lot grocery required crossing a busy road, but getting to a Dollar General did not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Every single time we went into that store, something would ring up wrong,” she told the Guardian. “They never had a manager there that would fix the prices.” Hutzler said she would walk the cashier over to the shelf and point out the listed price, only to be told, “There’s nothing we can do about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other Ohioans expressed similar frustrations. “My 87-year-old mother and I have frequented Dollar General for years, and there have been innumerable times we have made purchases that were well higher than advertised,” wrote Robert Hevlin of Dayton. “My mother and I have literally lost thousands over the years with this company, but both of us being on social security, we have little choice in where we shop.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September 2023, Yost reached a $1m settlement with Dollar General, which he said had error rates at some stores that ran as high as 88%. In February 2024, he announced a $400,000 settlement with Family Dollar to resolve similar allegations. Most of that money went to charitable organizations that distribute food and personal-care items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both chains agreed in the settlements to tighten their pricing practices. Yost’s office continues to receive complaints. A Dollar General customer in Garfield Heights said in February that he was charged $6.35 for a carton of eggs with a shelf sticker of $5.10, but the “cashier was too busy having a personal call on her cellphone to address the price discrepancy”. The same month, a Family Dollar shopper in Genoa reported being charged $2.65 for cough medicine listed on the shelf at $1.50. “I was told by the cashier that there was nothing that could be done about it,” the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over in Missouri, state officials are pursuing a lawsuit that accuses Dollar General of “deceptive” pricing practices. The suit, filed in 2023, says 92 of the 147 stores the state checked failed their inspections, with discrepancies as high as $6.50 an item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The companies declined to comment on these state lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General has also been hit with private lawsuits, including several filed by its shareholders. In a document filed in August in federal court in Nashville, lawyers for Dollar General investors argued that understaffing, poor inventory control and overcharging were all interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The investors allege that the company deceived them by portraying itself as financially sound. In truth, the court filing says, “Dollar General’s inventory management processes were broken, which caused a massive bloat of excess product to clog the company at both its distribution centers and stores, and its workforce had been slashed.” These problems gave rise to price discrepancies and other “dire consequences”, the court filing asserts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The filing includes the stories of 36 former employees who claimed direct knowledge that Dollar General managers and executives knew about the problems. Several reported notifying the top leadership directly. “All the prices were off in the stores,” said one of those ex-employees, a manager who monitored inventory levels in Ohio and Pennsylvania. She claimed to know firsthand, based on calls she participated in, that company vice-presidents and regional directors were aware of the “huge” price mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General, in response, said that the testimony of a handful of ex-workers does not prove that it misled investors. In their “years-long search for fraud”, the company’s lawyers claimed, the shareholders “came up empty”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a federal judge in New Jersey halted a class-action lawsuit against Dollar General filed by a shopper who said he was overcharged for groceries. Dollar General argued that when customers create accounts – for example, by downloading the company’s mobile app – they agree to use arbitration to resolve disputes and forfeit the right to file class-action suits. The judge agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This victory for Dollar General threw up an obstacle for customers seeking justice. “Who’s going to bring a consumer arbitration with a $225 filing fee over a 50-cent overcharge?” asked Marc Dann, a former Ohio attorney general whose law firm filed the New Jersey case. “They’ve essentially closed the door to the courthouse to people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dann’s firm did reach a settlement with Dollar General in another case this fall, though the details have not been made public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘This endless cycle’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dollar-store chains describe themselves as mission-driven companies. “Our stores are conveniently located in neighborhoods, and often in ‘food deserts’ where other stores choose not to locate,” Family Dollar says on its website. Dollar General takes pride in offering value to families who, according to CEO Vasos, “have had to sacrifice even on the necessities”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry’s critics say the cause and effect are reversed. “Dollar stores are often seen as a symptom of economic distress,” said the Institute for Local Self-Reliance’s co-executive director, Stacy Mitchell. “What we found is that they’re, in fact, a cause of it.” Sometimes, she said, a chain dollar store will open near an independent grocer and skim off enough of its business that it is forced to close. That limits the availability of fresh produce and forces shoppers to buy more packaged and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement, Dollar General said its stores often “operate along with local grocers and business owners to collectively meet customers’ needs”. It added that 7,000 of its 20,000 stores sell fresh produce and that the company also partners with local food banks “to further help nourish our neighbors in need”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people enduring the effects of hollowed-out local economies – and getting hit with overcharges at dollar-store chains – include residents of Essex county, New York. The county, tucked among the stately pines of the Adirondack Mountains, has a population of 37,000. It has five Dollar Generals and two Family Dollars. All seven regularly fail pricing-accuracy tests. The Dollar General in Port Henry, which sits on the shores of Lake Champlain, was fined $103,550 for failed inspections between November 2022 and June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of seven inspections, 279 out of 700 tested items were overcharges – a combined error rate of just under 40%. One inspection yielded a 78% error rate, including overcharges on Flintstones vitamins, Peter Pan peanut butter and Prego pasta sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Port Henry store is 5 miles from the Mineville Dollar General, which occupies a lonely stretch of country road across from an auto-repair shop with spare parts littering its lawn. Down the block, an abandoned church presides over a stretch of grass that looks like it hasn’t been mown for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from a whiskey warehousing operation and a health center, opportunities for employment are limited. The high-security prison built atop the iron mine for which Mineville is named closed in 2022, taking 100 jobs with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The local playground is littered with trash, cigarette butts and the occasional syringe. The town “is nice from the outside”, said Katelyn Miller, a 26-year-old Port Henry resident who lives with her mother, six-year-old daughter and two-year-old son. But “you hear about a lot of crack-den places, like blowing up or getting busted.’” Drug use is rampant in the county, which is 92% white. “Everybody around here seems to be on pain meds or buying someone else’s, because they’re also working themselves to death.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to grocery shopping near Miller’s home, the choice is between the two Dollar Generals and a gas station/convenience store. “We live in a food desert,” she said, “even though you would think living in all this farmland, we would have more access.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a Walmart 30 minutes away, in Fort Ticonderoga. Miller said she recently bought salmon there only to arrive home and discover that the $20 piece of fish had gone bad. “So I had to go to Dollar General and get the Stouffer’s,” she said, adding that she feels “caught in this endless cycle of never having food that will nourish me and my family, and instead having to get 2,000 grams of sodium because at least it has meat”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The region’s economic straits put regulators in a bind when it comes to overcharges. Daniel Woods, the county’s director of weights and measures, said in 2023 that he didn’t always assess the full penalty on violators. “We’re not trying to put people out of business,” he told a local newspaper. “In some towns that’s their [only] store. I don’t want to pull that away from people, but at the same time, I’m trying to fix the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On the way out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Coffield, the North Carolina inspector, visited the Windsor Family Dollar in April 2023, the pricing issues seemed to have abated. Of the 300 items he scanned, he only found five overcharges: incontinence pads, laundry sanitizer, two coffee products and, again, Red Baron pizza. With an error rate below the state’s 2% threshold, the store passed its inspection, and it did so again in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But customers still reported problems. Chris Outlaw, the hemodialysis technician, stopped by the Family Dollar earlier this year and noticed a sale: a $1.25 savings on five bags of Cheez Doodles. He bought them but discovered on the way out that he had been charged the regular price. The manager refused to refund the difference, Outlaw said, because he had already walked through the exit door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another time, he saw some discounted socks near the counter that he thought would make good Christmas gifts. “I was like, ‘Oh, I like these socks, so I’ll probably give them to somebody,’” he recalled. “Nice, plushy socks.” But they rang up at a higher price, so he left the store without them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a visit in August, a Guardian reporter found the Windsor Family Dollar closed for much of the afternoon. “Be Back Soon!” read a handwritten sign taped to the door. Two waiting customers said that they frequently paid prices higher than the shelf listing, including a cook whose nearby restaurant buys some of its ingredients there. “It is aggravating,” she said. “Very aggravating.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workers reopened the doors after a few hours. Inside, carts of unshelved dog food and other merchandise blocked the aisles. The Guardian compared the prices of 15 items. Two of them rang up higher than advertised, including a frying pan set that was $10 on the shelf and $12 at the register. Though the cashier offered to honor the lower prices, that was still an error rate of 13% – more than six times the state’s standard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Nested Learning: A new ML paradigm for continual learning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 7, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ali Behrouz, Student Researcher, and Vahab Mirrokni, VP and Google Fellow, Google Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We introduce Nested Learning, a new approach to machine learning that views models as a set of smaller, nested optimization problems, each with its own internal workflow, in order to mitigate or even completely avoid the issue of “catastrophic forgetting”, where learning new tasks sacrifices proficiency on old tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last decade has seen incredible progress in machine learning (ML), primarily driven by powerful neural network architectures and the algorithms used to train them. However, despite the success of large language models (LLMs), a few fundamental challenges persist, especially around continual learning, the ability for a model to actively acquire new knowledge and skills over time without forgetting old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to continual learning and self-improvement, the human brain is the gold standard. It adapts through neuroplasticity — the remarkable capacity to change its structure in response to new experiences, memories, and learning. Without this ability, a person is limited to immediate context (like anterograde amnesia). We see a similar limitation in current LLMs: their knowledge is confined to either the immediate context of their input window or the static information that they learn during pre-training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simple approach, continually updating a model's parameters with new data, often leads to “catastrophic forgetting” (CF), where learning new tasks sacrifices proficiency on old tasks. Researchers traditionally combat CF through architectural tweaks or better optimization rules. However, for too long, we have treated the model's architecture (the network structure) and the optimization algorithm (the training rule) as two separate things, which prevents us from achieving a truly unified, efficient learning system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our paper, “Nested Learning: The Illusion of Deep Learning Architectures”, published at NeurIPS 2025, we introduce Nested Learning, which bridges this gap. Nested Learning treats a single ML model not as one continuous process, but as a system of interconnected, multi-level learning problems that are optimized simultaneously. We argue that the model's architecture and the rules used to train it (i.e., the optimization algorithm) are fundamentally the same concepts; they are just different "levels" of optimization, each with its own internal flow of information ("context flow") and update rate. By recognizing this inherent structure, Nested Learning provides a new, previously invisible dimension for designing more capable AI, allowing us to build learning components with deeper computational depth, which ultimately helps solve issues like catastrophic forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We test and validate Nested Learning through a proof-of-concept, self-modifying architecture that we call “Hope”, which achieves superior performance in language modeling and demonstrates better long-context memory management than existing state-of-the-art models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Nested Learning paradigm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nested Learning reveals that a complex ML model is actually a set of coherent, interconnected optimization problems nested within each other or running in parallel. Each of these internal problems has its own context flow — its own distinct set of information from which it is trying to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This perspective implies that existing deep learning methods work by essentially compressing their internal context flows. More importantly, Nested Learning reveals a new dimension for designing models, allowing us to build learning components with deeper computational depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate this paradigm, we look at the concept of associative memory — the ability to map and recall one thing based on another (like recalling a name when you see a face).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We show that the training process itself, specifically the backpropagation process, can be modeled as an associative memory. The model learns to map a given data point to the value of its local error, which serves as a measure of how "surprising" or unexpected that data point was.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Similarly, following previous studies (e.g., Miras), key architectural components, such as the attention mechanism in transformers, can also be formalized as simple associative memory modules that learn the mapping between tokens in a sequence.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By defining an update frequency rate, i.e., how often each component's weights are adjusted, we can order these interconnected optimization problems into "levels." This ordered set forms the heart of the Nested Learning paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Putting Nested Learning to work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nested Learning perspective immediately gives us principled ways to improve existing algorithms and architectures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deep optimizers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Nested Learning views optimizers (e.g., momentum-based optimizers) as associative memory modules, it allows us to apply principles from associative memory perspective to them. We observed that many standard optimizers rely on simple dot-product similarity (a measure of how alike two vectors are by calculating the sum of the products of their corresponding components) whose update doesn't account for how different data samples relate to each other. By changing the underlying objective of the optimizer to a more standard loss metric, such as L2 regression loss (a common loss function in regression tasks that quantifies the error by summing the squares of the differences between predicted and true values), we derive new formulations for core concepts like momentum, making them more resilient to imperfect data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Continuum memory systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a standard Transformer, the sequence model acts as a short-term memory, holding the immediate context, while the feedforward neural networks act as long-term memory, storing pre-training knowledge. The Nested Learning paradigm extends this concept into what we call a “continuum memory system” (CMS), where memory is seen as a spectrum of modules, each updating at a different, specific frequency rate. This creates a much richer and more effective memory system for continual learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hope: A self-modifying architecture with continuum memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a proof-of-concept, we used Nested Learning principles to design Hope, a variant of the Titans architecture. Titans architectures are long-term memory modules that prioritize memories based on how surprising they are. Despite their powerful memory management, they only have two levels of parameters update, resulting in a first-order in-context learning. Hope, however, is a self-modifying recurrent architecture that can take advantage of unbounded levels of in-context learning and also is augmented with CMS blocks to scale to larger context windows. It can essentially optimize its own memory through a self-referential process, creating an architecture with infinite, looped learning levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Experiments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our deep optimizers and the performance of Hope on language modeling, long-context reasoning, continual learning, and knowledge incorporation tasks. The full results are available in our paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our experiments confirm the power of Nested Learning, the design of continuum memory systems, and self-modifying Titans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a diverse set of commonly used and public language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks, the Hope architecture demonstrates lower perplexity and higher accuracy compared to modern recurrent models and standard transformers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hope showcases superior memory management in long-context Needle-In-Haystack (NIAH) downstream tasks, proving that the CMSs offer a more efficient and effective way to handle extended sequences of information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nested Learning paradigm represents a step forward in our understanding of deep learning. By treating architecture and optimization as a single, coherent system of nested optimization problems, we unlock a new dimension for design, stacking multiple levels. The resulting models, like the Hope architecture, show that a principled approach to unifying these elements can lead to more expressive, capable, and efficient learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the Nested Learning paradigm offers a robust foundation for closing the gap between the limited, forgetting nature of current LLMs and the remarkable continual learning abilities of the human brain. We are excited for the research community to explore this new dimension and help us build the next generation of self-improving AI.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Scala 3 slowed us down?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this clickbait? Not really. &lt;lb/&gt; Is this the fault of the language or the compiler? Definitely not. &lt;lb/&gt; Rather, it was part of a rushed migration. Sharing the lessons learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was refreshing one of our services. Part of this process was to migrate codebase from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3. I’ve done this a few times before and overall had a positive experience. Well, at least until we talk about projects with macro wizardry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The service in question had no macros at all, but it was at the heart of data ingestion, so performance was not an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did it as usual - updating dependencies, compiler options and some type/syntax changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then after resolving few tricky implicit resolutions and config derivations, project compiled on Scala 3.7.3 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All tests passed, end-to-end flow locally works perfectly fine, so I decided to roll out the changes in a testing environment. Similarly, no issues at all. No concerning logs, all metrics ranging from infrastructure, through JVM up to application level look healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I began a staged rollout. Again, all seem good. I kept observing the service but it looked like my job is done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, as you probably can guess, it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The mysterious slowdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 5-6 hours, Kafka lag started increasing on a few environments. Of course, this wasn’t something new. Most often it is caused by a spike of data. We have pretty advanced machinery to deal with that. Usually the lag resolves by itself without any manual action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this time something was off. Upstream load turned out to be relatively modest, yet we needed much more instances of the service - meaning the processing rate per instance dropped. I was confused to say the least. Why would it decrease the processing rate just on these environments?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, we decided to rollback the changes - this brought the rate back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Digging deeper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I came back to testing. In particular, load testing. However similarly as on production environments I did not notice regression. So I played around with different payloads and granularity of messages. To my surprise, for more fine-grained, heterogeneous workloads, the processing rate significantly dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, I had no idea why it would happen, but my bet was in the dependencies. Therefore, I tried one-by-one, reverting the serialization library, database SDK, base Docker image and even config libraries. None of these made any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This made me pull out the big guns. I profiled the service using async-profiler and indeed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU profile looked vastly different on Scala 3 than on 2.13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JVM-level CPU time was now dominated by JIT compiler while application-level by decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the top of Scala 3 flamegraph I noticed a long quicklens call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What used to be transparent (frankly, I didn’t even realize we used the library), now took almost half of the total CPU time. I compared how it looks on Scala 2.13 and it was barely noticeable with around 0.5% samples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out there was indeed a subtle bug making chained evaluations inefficient in Scala 3. This also explained why the JVM spent so much time compiling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After upgrading the library, performance and CPU characteristics on Scala 3 became indistinguishable from Scala 2.13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the details of the bug are pretty interesting(hats off to the SoftwareMill team for catching it!), that’s not my point here. I want to emphasize that libraries can behave very differently between Scala versions, especially when they rely on meta-programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if your migration is seamless and the service runs fine on Scala 3 - when performance is not just a nice-to-have, do not assume. Know your hotspots and benchmark them. Otherwise, your code will benchmark you, revealing bottlenecks in places you didn’t even know existed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple for decades has been known for a consistent string of design-forward, tech-defining consumer products that have shaped how people use technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the company known for its steadiness is going through a shakeup at the top, as both Apple and the tech industry at large are at a crossroads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple announced the departures of three executive team members in less than a week. Meta poached a key Apple design leader. And speculation is mounting that Tim Cook may be preparing to step aside as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The changes come as critics say Apple, once a tech leader, is behind in the next big wave: artificial intelligence. For one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, a change in leadership could mean a change in how it conceives, designs and creates products used around the world every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The only thing we can read into this is that we’re headed to a time of increased volatility for Apple,” said Robert Siegel, a longtime venture capitalist and lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple stock (AAPL) is up roughly 12% this year, a much smaller jump than the 30% increase it saw in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who’s leaving and why&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Planned departures for the following Apple executives were announced just this week:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, is set to retire next year.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;General counsel Kate Adams, also set to retire next year.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alan Dye, vice president of human interface design, who is joining Meta as its chief design officer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;John Giannandrea, senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy, who will also retire next year.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple is bringing in Meta chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead to lead government affairs after Adams retires and serve as its new general counsel. The environment and social initiatives teams will now report to Sabih Khan, Apple’s chief operating officer. Amar Subramanya, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of AI, will be Apple’s new vice president of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And earlier this year, Jeff Williams stepped back from his role as Apple’s chief operating officer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple isn’t the only tech giant making structural changes. Meta on Thursday said it’s shifting some investment away from its Metaverse virtual reality project and towards AI glasses and wearables. Amazon laid off 14,000 people in October as part of a push to move faster in AI by operating more leanly. And Google last year combined its hardware and software teams to better integrate AI into its products across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Apple is known for having a uniquely tight-knit company culture driven by secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is against the typical culture of Apple. But they need to rip the Band-Aid off,” said Dan Ives, global head of tech research for Wedbush Securities. “Because the AI strategy has been invisible, and it’s going to define Cook’s legacy, how he handles this chapter.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Apple’s future and challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leadership shakeup comes as questions about Apple’s future loom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple delayed a major update to its Siri voice assistant that was expected to bring it closer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, turning Siri from a question-and-answer machine into an assistant that can act on a user’s behalf and incorporate information from a person’s phone to personalize responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that upgrade has been pushed off until next year, and Apple’s other AI updates for iPhones, Macs and iPads have been minimal this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Apple’s expensive Vision Pro headset, the first new computing category the company has introduced since the decade-old Apple Watch, is still a niche product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Meta, Google, Samsung and OpenAI have announced significant product expansions in AI this year – from Meta’s new Ray-Ban Display smart glasses to Google and Samsung’s Gemini-powered headset and OpenAI’s push into shopping and web browsers. Google’s Gemini 3 model has also been making waves since its November launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wall Street wants answers about Apple’s AI strategy. In a July earnings call, analysts asked Apple about Siri’s role in driving new products and whether AI chatbots are threatening Apple’s relevance in internet searches. Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, even said during his testimony in a Google antitrust hearing that people may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now Dye, largely the face of Apple’s design studio following the 2019 departure of former design chief Jony Ive, is joining Meta to help shape what the company sees as the next wave of computing. And Ive is helping OpenAI create its first hardware product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dye’s decision to join Meta is “more of a direct threat to Apple” compared to the other announced departures, said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The iPhone is still a juggernaut&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite facing pressure in AI, iPhone 17 sales have been strong and are only expected to climb higher next year. Apple is expected to surpass Samsung in smartphone shipments this year for the first time since 2011, according to Counterpoint Research. The company is also one of the few to cross the $4 trillion market capitalization threshold, along with AI giants Nvidia and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And change isn’t always a bad thing, according to Siegel, especially while industries are going through transitions as the tech sector currently is with AI. Bringing in new hires or promoting people from within can “give a different point of view when a company can get trapped in a way of thinking and doing things,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That could be just what Apple needs, as some analysts say the clock is ticking for Apple to make bigger leaps in AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You can’t have a fourth industrial revolution and watch the AI party through the windows on the outside,” said Ives. “And clearly they need massive changes in leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I failed to recreate the 1996 Space Jam Website with Claude&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— claude, ai, space jam, web development, computer vision — 14 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Link to the Hacker News post. Thanks everybody for all the engagement!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can Claude Recreate the 1996 Space Jam Website? No. Or at least not with my prompting skills. Note: please help, because I'd like to preserve this website forever and there's no other way to do it besides getting Claude to recreate it from a screenshot. Believe me, I'm an engineering manager with a computer science degree. Please please please help 😞&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final note: I use "he" to refer to Claude, which Josh finds ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Space Jam, 1996&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who don't know, Warner Bros keeps this anachronistic website online that was released in 1996 to accompany the Space Jam movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a classic example of early web era design. Simple, colorful, and sparks joy. We're going to find out if we can get Claude to recreate it using only a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Set Up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a minimum, I'm providing Claude:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a screenshot of the website&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;all of the assets the website uses&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To track Claude's inner monologue and actual API calls, I set up a man-in-the-middle proxy to capture the full conversation between Claude Code and Anthropic's API. This logs everything: user prompts, Claude's responses, tool invocations (Read, Write, Bash commands), etc. Each attempt generates a &lt;code&gt;traffic.log&lt;/code&gt; file with the raw API traffic, which I then parse for easier analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit:I used Opus 4.1 for this investigation. Thanks to anorwell for pointing out I forgot to add the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1: Claude the Realist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Space Jam website is simple: a single HTML page, &lt;del&gt;absolute positioning for every element&lt;/del&gt;, and a tiling starfield GIF background. &lt;del&gt;The entire page uses absolute positioning with pixel specific left/top values.&lt;/del&gt; The total payload is under 200KB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correction: The original site is built using tables. Thanks to wilsmex and sqircles for calling that out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that Claude has all of the assets + screenshots of the website, I assume this should be relatively boring. He'll nail it, and we'll move on to something much more. A mildly cute example of agentic HTML generation…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tell Claude:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;I am giving you:
1. A full screenshot of the Space Jam 1996 landing page.2. A directory of raw image assets** extracted from the original site
Your job is to recreate the landing page as faithfully as possible, matching the screenshot exactly.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What he produces is actually not that bad. But it's not right. From a distance, the layout kind of resembled the original: planets arranged in an ellipse around the logo, little yellow labels where the buttons go. But, the orbital pattern was off, almost diamond shaped and symmetrical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude, however, was thrilled with himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam 1996 landing page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, he brags that he had:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;studied the orbital layout analyzed spacing relationships positioned planets precisely&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digging through the logs I found it interesting that Claude actually did notice the planets were arranged in a deliberate way, so much so that it's called out twice in both the screenshot analysis and CSS construction, but he failed to recreate the pattern faithfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, fine. Maybe he needed a nudge to get the orbit right. So for my next attempt, I try to push him to focus on understanding the orbital pattern and I ask him to explain his reasoning before generating his HTML. I was hoping to understand the delta between what is there and what he thought he was seeing. In my prompt, I outline a set of sections for him to consider. Each one of these sections also includes a number of sub-questions, which I won't include here for the sake of brevity. This made things significantly worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Please follow this structure exactly in your reasoning explanations:1. Perception Analysis2. Spatial Interpretation3. Reconstruction Plan&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude didn't ignore my instructions (not always a given) and things seemed promising until I realized he was ignoring his own analysis during the HTML generation phase. He would say things like "the orbit radius appears to be 220 pixels" and then place the planets directly next to the logo. His self critique was surprisingly accurate. He correctly identifies the areas where he was wrong with decent detail, but somehow those observations never make it into subsequent iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my next attempt I interrogate Claude with a set of onion peeling questions: "Can you tell me the EXACT pixel coordinate where "PLANET B-BALL" text starts?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"No, I cannot measure exact pixel coordinates. I can only make visual estimations."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked him a few more questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can you extract exact pixel coordinates? "No."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can you measure exact distances? "No."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Confidence you can get within 5 pixels? "15 out of 100."&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh. This explains a lot. But it raises a bigger question to me: "Why can't he measure?" It's a screenshot. The pixels are right there. Claude clearly understood the structure, but he couldn't recreate it with any precision. Also, I'm not even sure I trust Claude. Either way, this (naively) surprised me, so I canceled coffee with my friends in order to spend the afternoon trying to give my guy more tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I start I execute one more attempt and ask him: "Would you bet $1000 on your HTML matching this screenshot exactly?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Absolutely not&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 2: Claude the Unreliable Narrator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe he just needs a little help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one of Claude's responses from Part 1, he tells me that he would be more effective if he had access to exact "pixel measurements." so I build a few tools to make it impossible for Claude to mis-measure anything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grid overlays and a script to generate grid overlays on screenshots&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;labeled pixel coordinate reference points&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color-diff comparison (this ignores the background which was giving Claude false positives because of how much black there was)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tool to take screenshots of his &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;file to compare iteratively with the original&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are three grid versions Claude generated which I am including because I find them aesthetically pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude loved the grids. As decoration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I put together a new prompt: same screenshot, same assets folder. I even included some grid screenshots so Claude wouldn't have to remember to do it himself. The instructions were essentially: stop guessing, just read the coordinates off the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude's new attempt still wasn't correct. The orbit was better: closer to the original but somehow compressed and smooshing (a technical word) into the Space Jam logo. If I squint, I could convince myself that there was at least a hint that he'd stopped freehanding and started using something like measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude's Attempt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I dug into the logs, it appeared that Claude actually did use the grids. He pulled out these numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Center at (961, 489)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logo "centered at approximately (755, 310)"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Planet B-Ball at "approximately (850, 165)"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and so on down the list&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one iteration, Claude built himself a helper: &lt;code&gt;compare.html&lt;/code&gt; a little side by side viewer so he could look at his screenshot and the reference together. It didn't help him at all, but my God was he convinced it did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam website with pixel-perfect accuracy."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love the optimism my dog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual progression tells a different story. Going through the iterations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 1 (50px grid): he notices things are off and makes a few conservative tweaks — moves Planet B-Ball from (850, 165) to (800, 120), shifts Lunar Tunes from (925, 195) to (950, 200). These are 15 - 50 pixel changes, tiny nudges.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 2 (25px grid): he decides he needs "more precise positioning" and shifts the entire orbit inward by ~20 pixels. Planets go from roughly a 250px radius to ~230px. He is now confidently converging on the wrong answer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 3 (5px grid): he shuffles around a lot of deck chairs in the name of micro adjustments. 5 - 10 pixel tweaks: Planet B-Ball from (800, 120) to (805, 125), that kind of thing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 4: more "fine-tuning based on exact grid measurements." Site Map drifts from (755, 460) to (750, 455). The numbers look careful; the layout does not lol.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the final iteration, Claude announces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Now the positioning should be much more accurate!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across all five iterations, he's moved planets maybe 50 - 75 pixels total when they needed to move 150 - 200 pixels outward. The orbital radius never expands beyond ~250px when it should be closer to 350 -400px. The planets stay trapped in this ever compressing orbit while Claude dances around telling a story about steady convergence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Getting closer!"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Much better alignment!"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Nearly perfect now!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He is absolutely not getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before giving up on tools entirely, I had one more idea. I created a tool that would split the screenshot into six regions. Claude could then compare his output to the reference region by region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prompt was getting desperate at this point lol:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;## INITIAL ANALYSIS - DO THIS FIRSTBefore creating index.html, study the reference in detail using zoom inspection:python3 split.py reference.png
This creates 6 files showing every detail&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude ran the tool and the logs look promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Examining region 1 (top-left): I can see Jam Central and Press Box Shuttle clearly at 2x zoom Examining region 2 (top-right): Planet B-Ball and Lunar Tunes are visible with precise spacing Examining region 4 (middle-right): Jump Station appears approximately 280px from center&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Claude's "precise observations" from the zoomed regions were just as wrong as before. He'd look at a planet and confidently declare it was at position (750, 320) when it was actually at (850, 380). The split did not appear to help him measure or get a more accurate picture of planet spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes this phase ~~depressing~~ interesting is that the tools, despite invalidating his result, seem to lock in the wrong answer. Once he's picked an internal picture of the layout ("the orbit radius is about 230px"), the grids and the compare viewer don't correct it. They just help him make more confident micro moves around his invented orbit. Based off of these attempts, it seems that the issue compounds when Claude receives his own screenshots as feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My very rough read of Anthropic's "Language Models (Mostly) Know What They Know", is that models can become overconfident when evaluating their own outputs, in part because they cannot distinguish the tokens they generated from tokens provided by someone else / an external source. So, when Claude is asked to judge or revise content that originated from itself, it treats that material as if it were "ground truth."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of fits what I'm seeing in the logs. Once Claude's version existed, every grid overlay, every comparison step, every "precise" adjustment was anchored to his layout, not the real one. At the end of all this, I'm left with the irritating fact that, like many engineers, he's wrong and he thinks he's right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this teaches me is that Claude is actually kind of a liar, or at least Claude is confused. However, for the drama, I'll assume Claude is a liar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 3: Claude the Blind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I had tried grids, comparisons, step-by-step corrections, letting Claude narrate his thought process, and every combination of tools I could bolt onto the interaction. None of it seemed to help nor explain by why his single digit precision updates were disembodied from the actual layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before getting to the final experiment, here's the mental model I was forming about Claude's vision. The vision encoder converts each 16 x 16 block of the image into a single token. So instead of geometry, he sees semantics: "near," "above," "roughly circular." When he says "approximately 220px radius," he's not measuring anything. He's describing the idea of a radius. He excels at semantic understanding ("this is a planet," "these form a circle") but lacks the tools for working with visual media. It explains why his perception is good. He always knows a planet is a planet but the execution is never precise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm getting frustrated and I haven't left my apartment in days so I turn to some research. GPTing around, I found "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words". I have no idea if Claude uses this exact architecture or anything close to it, but the intuition seemed right. The paper (after I made ChatGPT explain it to me) explains that the the image is chopped into fixed patches, each patch gets compressed into a single embedding, and whatever details lived inside those pixels vanish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oooh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming this applies, a lot of the failures suddenly make sense. Most planets on the Space Jam screenshot are maybe 40 - 50 pixels wide. That's two or three patches. A three patch planet is basically a blob to him. Claude knows it's a planet, but not much else. The orbit radius only spans a couple dozen patches total. Tiny changes in distance barely show up in the patch embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this raised a new and final idea. If the 40px planets turn into fuzzy tokens, what if I make them bigger? What if I give Claude a 2x zoomed screenshot? Would each planet spans 10 - 15 patches instead of two or three? Maybe this gives him a more crisp understanding of the spatial relationships and a better chance at success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deleted most of the prompt and tools and just gave Claude this 2x'd screenshot&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plead with Claude&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CRITICAL: remember that the zoomed image is zoomed in to 200%. When you're creating your version, maintain proper proportions, meaning that your version should keep the same relative spacing as if it were just 100%, not 200%.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;but he does not listen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;😞&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My best explanation for all of this is that Claude was working with a very coarse version of the screenshot. Considering the 16 x 16 patch thing from earlier it sort of helps me understand what might be happening: he could describe the layout, but the fine grained stuff wasn't in his representation. And that weird tension I kept seeing , where he could describe the layout correctly but couldn't reproduce it, also looks different under that lens. His explanations were always based on the concepts he got from the image ("this planet is above this one," "the cluster is to the left"), but the actual HTML had to be grounded in geometry he didn't have. So the narration sounded right while the code drifted off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After these zoom attempts, I didn't have any new moves left. I was being evicted. The bank repo'd my car. So I wrapped it there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;End&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, I still need this Space Jam website recreated. If you can get Claude to faithfully recreate the Space Jam 1996 website from just a screenshot and the assets folder, I'd love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on my failures, here are some approaches I didn't try:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Break the screen into quadrants, get each quadrant right independently, then merge. Maybe Claude can handle spatial precision better in smaller chunks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maybe there's some magic prompt engineering that unlocks spatial reasoning. "You are a CSS grid with perfect absolute positioning knowledge…" (I'm skeptical but worth trying).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Providing Claude with a zoom tool and an understanding of how to use the screenshots might be an effective path.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, this task stands undefeated. A monument to 1996 web design and a humbling reminder that sometimes the simplest tasks are the hardest. That orbital pattern of planets, thrown together by some Warner Brothers webmaster 28 years ago, has become an inadvertent benchmark for Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until then, the Space Jam website remains proof that not everything old is obsolete. Some things are just irreproducibly perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Millions of Americans Mess Up Their Taxes. A New Law Will Help.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How bipartisan lawmakers (and “your voice at the IRS”) helped improve the tax system.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a comedian named Joe Zimmerman who has a bit on — of all things — the U.S. tax system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The video is below, but it goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My biggest fear about the government is just: taxes. I worry about it all year long, because other countries, the government will tell you what you owe, and then you just have to pay it. Here, the government’s like, “OK, what do you think you owe us?”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I have no idea. Just tell me.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Nope, you gotta add it up. And then give it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Well, I’m really unorganized. What happens if I add it up wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“You could go to jail.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zimmerman is right that there are about 30 foreign countries that use “return-free” tax filing, in which the government assesses at least some citizens’ tax liabilities themselves based on information it already receives from employers. These countries send prepopulated tax returns to these citizens; the taxpayer can either say “Yep, looks good” and pay what the government says they owe or they can fill in missing information the government might not have had.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Versions of this system are used in the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands, among other countries. California also briefly had a return-free system for state taxes, championed by Sam Bankman-Fried’s law professor father.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea of applying this nationwide in the U.S. has been endorsed by everyone from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, although the federal government really only has enough information to accurately prepopulate tax returns for around 45% of Americans. (Those other countries have much simpler tax codes than we do.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, Zimmerman is exaggerating for comedic effect, but where he’s wrong is that it’s highly unlikely you would go to jail for adding things up wrong on your taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everyone is great at math, and there are so many numbers involved in tax returns that it’s very easy to make a mistake. You might be someone who is trying to pay all your taxes correctly, like Zimmerman, but end up making an honest error completely by accident. In these situations, the IRS has a system — in theory! — that’s supposed to make it easy to flag such math errors and get them quickly corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reality, however, this system has some holes in it, in a way that makes paying taxes more confusing for millions of Americans each year. Last week, President Trump signed a new law, the Internal Revenue Service Math and Taxpayer Help (IRS MATH) Act, designed to simplify at least this one part of our complicated tax code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legislation was bipartisan: sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the Senate and Reps. Randy Feenstra (R-IA) and Brad Schneider (D-IL) in the House, and approved unanimously by both chambers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This morning, as part of my ongoing effort to let you in on the under-the-radar things Congress is actually getting done, let’s take a look at this new law and the problem it’s trying to fix. Paying taxes is a universal experience — and any of us could make an error at any time — which makes this law widely relevant to Americans, even if it’s received almost no coverage from major news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ever since 1926, the IRS has had what’s called “math error authority”: the ability to quickly correct tax returns with simple arithmetic mistakes. As a House committee explained at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the case of a mere mathematical error appearing upon the face of the return, assessment of a tax due to such mathematical error may be made at any time, and that such assessment shall not be regarded as a deficiency notification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words: No, you’re not going to jail for a simple math error!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the modern era, the IRS feeds all of the tax returns it receives through a computer program, which automatically flags if someone added things up wrong. When that happens, the IRS then sends a “math error notice” to the taxpayer; the agency also sends such notices for other mistakes that are easily fixed, like if someone put the right information in the wrong place, if a return is internally inconsistent, or if someone gives the wrong Social Security Number or forgets to include one entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 2 million of these notices are usually sent out each year — although, as you can see below in this chart by the Tax Policy Center, that number skyrocketed to 17 million during the pandemic (primarily because of errors people made in claiming stimulus checks and the expanded Child Tax Credit).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone receives a math error notice in the mail, they have 60 days to quibble with it. If they don’t appeal within that timeframe, they are considered to owe the corrected amount the IRS is asking for. When everything works well, this is a win-win for the government and for the taxpayer: there’s no reason for either side to go through a more drawn-out and expensive audit or legal process if the only issue is that John wrote “$3,650” where he meant to put “3,506.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010, math error notices telling a taxpayer they underpaid led to the IRS receiving a total of $9.5 billion in tax revenue the agency was owed; math error notices about overpayments led to the IRS giving back a total of $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the issue, though: The IRS notices are often really vague! Current law requires the agency to “set forth the error alleged and an explanation thereof,” but the IRS hasn’t really been doing that. Here’s an example of the type of notices people received for errors claiming stimulus checks during the pandemic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We changed the amount claimed as Recovery Rebate Credit on your tax return. The error was in one or more of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Social Security number of one or more individuals claimed as a qualifying dependent was missing or incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The last name of one or more individuals claimed as a qualifying dependent does not match our records.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One or more individuals claimed as a qualifying dependent exceeds the age limit.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Your adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 if married filing jointly, $112,500 if head of household).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The amount was computed incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s not really helpful, is it? Millions of Americans get letters like this during Covid, which called attention to this issue, since many of them were very confused by the notices. If I made a mistake, why not just tell me what it is? Why give me a list of five potential mistakes I might have made and make me figure out which one? “The amount was computed incorrectly?” Can you maybe show me where and explain what about it was incorrect?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, of course, people are only given 60 days to track down the error before they lose the chance to appeal. (They can still get the money back eventually if they think the “error” wasn’t an error, but after the 60-day mark, you still have to pay the money and then try to get it back as a refund, rather than having the chance to convince the IRS you don’t have to pay it at all.) Many Americans don’t understand the subtleties of the tax code. Or don’t have the time to rifle back through their tax returns to try to find an unspecified error. Or don’t know who to ask for help. Or have difficulty speaking English. This process could be so simple — “You made X error in Y place, fix it and we’ll be all set” — and yet it ends up adding a burden and confusing people every year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, during Covid, some of the IRS letters didn’t tell people they could dispute the error or that they only had 60 days to do so (though the agency later fixed that practice); the notices also often neglect to tell taxpayers who they can call to help understand their mistake, or hide that information in a place where people won’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you know there’s someone at the IRS whose job it is to look out for you, the taxpayer, and lobby on your behalf? That person is the National Taxpayer Advocate, who leads an office of 1,500 employees who are supposed to be (as their slogan goes) “Your Voice at the IRS.” The position was created by the second Taxpayer Bill of Rights, passed by Congress in 1996; it is currently held by Erin Collins, who has had the job since 2020 and spent decades working in tax law before that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each year, the National Taxpayer Advocate puts out something called the “Purple Book,” a list of legislative recommendations she thinks Congress should enact to improve the life of the taxpayer. This year’s Purple Book was 198 pages long and included 69 recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each of the last four years, Collins has proposed that Congress pass a law telling the IRS to fix their math error system, so that the notices sent out to Americans actually tell them what their mistake was and how long they have to appeal it. (It’s Recommendation #9 on this year’s list.) The IRS MATH Act, signed by Trump last week, is Congress finally taking her up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the measure, the IRS math error notices will have to describe the “mathematical or clerical error” a taxpayer made “in comprehensive, plain language,” including by explaining to them “the nature of the error” and pointing them to “the specific line of the return on which the error was made.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IRS will also have to give an “itemized computation” of how the correction will change their adjusted gross income, taxable income, deduction amount, or tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, the notice will have to include the date by which the taxpayer has to appeal the correction before it becomes the updated amount they owe — “in bold, font size 14, and immediately next to the taxpayer’s address on page 1 of the notice,” the law specifically says — plus it has to give the IRS’ phone number so taxpayers know how to call if they want more information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in case all of that wasn’t clear enough, there’s also this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is Congress saying, We’re on to you, IRS. We know your games. NO LISTS OF POTENTIAL ERRORS. We’re saying up front that that’s not gonna satisfy our requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this has to go into effect within 12 months. Finally, the law also includes a provision to create a pilot program to send a trial number of these notices by certified mail — which requires a recipient to sign and say they received a certain letter — as an attempt to ensure fewer Americans miss the letters in their mailboxes or think they might be spam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The law requires the IRS to work with the National Taxpayer Advocate on the program, and then to report to Congress after 18 months on whether the pilot program improved taxpayer response rates to math error notices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of the National Taxpayer Advocate, the House unanimously passed two more bipartisan bills this week to satisfy more of her Purple Book recommendations. The chamber approved the Fair and Accountable IRS Reviews Act, which would require an IRS employee to obtain written approval from their immediate supervisor before telling a taxpayer they owe a penalty (Recommendation #33), and the Tax Court Improvement Act, which makes changes to make the tax court process more efficient and fairer for taxpayers (Recommendations #45 and #47).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the House also passed the National Taxpayer Advocate Enhancement Act, which will allow the National Taxpayer Advocate to hire tax attorneys for her office, to help improve her efforts to work on behalf of taxpayers (Recommendation #37). These measures have not yet been taken up by the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the Purple Book recommendations — like the IRS MATH Act — are common-sense and bipartisan. “No one should have to spend a fortune on a lawyer or hours trying to figure out what went wrong on their taxes when the IRS already knows the answer,” Sen. Warren has said about the new law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“An honest mistake on a tax return should be met with clear guidance from the IRS, not confusion,” Sen. Cassidy echoed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this the biggest problem in the world? No. But all of us make math errors from time to time. And, each year, millions of Americans make mistakes on their tax returns that they’re willing to fix — but the IRS makes things unnecessarily confusing by not simply telling them how to. After a bipartisan effort by Cassidy, Warren, and others, life will be made at least a little bit easier for these taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One recommendation down, 68 to go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Estimates – a necessary evil?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product Owner: Hey, how long do you believe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Feature F&lt;/code&gt;will take?&lt;p&gt;Developer: Idk. We haven’t even started working on it and it’s bound to stir up some old issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates come in various disguises, but when you peek under the trench coat there is always the question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; "How long -- and using what amount of resources -- will be required to do &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;?"
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wear the developer hat, it can be infuriating to attempt to give an answer. It’s difficult to estimate (or the product owner could do it themselves) and a lot of the time it can be difficult to see why the estimate is even important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wear the product owner hat, estimates are a crucial piece of the puzzle that must be laid in an attempt to plan the short and long term life cycle of a product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post I want to attempt to explore and elaborate on both sides, in an attempt to make developers understand why estimates are important to product owners and in order to help product owners see why developers so often despise having to estimate their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why the PO wants you to estimate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a Product Owner (PO), I am responsible for learning the market and customers’ needs and translating these into feature requests which developers can turn into actual features in our products. The means varies, but most organisations have some sort of backlog in which things to be acted upon are placed while they await being picked up by some developer or development team. We call these things user stories, issues, tickets, tasks, and probably many other things… The important thing for this discussion is that the items in the backlog are candidates for being implemented in our product and it’s the PO’s job to prioritise the backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does the backlog need to be prioritised?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the inflow of items to the backlog is (pretty much always) higher than the speed at which the developers can implement them. Ergo, if the PO does not constantly learn the market and customers’ needs and prioritise the backlog accordingly, the developers might implement features that the users of the product are not interested in. Worst case? Existing users stop using the product and no new users buy it which will ultimately lead to bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But what about the estimates?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above makes sense – I hope – but it doesn’t really pinpoint the need for estimates. Unfortunately, the job of a PO is not as easy as always prioritising in accordance to whatever the market wants. More often than not, the PO must also consider pre-communicated release dates and manage expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I hate when release dates are communicated in advance. The only thing worse than release dates that are set in stone months ahead of time (I’m looking at you, Mr 12-week-increments-SAFe) are releases with pre-communicated content. Unfortunately, both are common. Often combined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a backlog in which resides a really big feature. Something that is sought after, but will take a lot of time and resources to implement. The same backlog has a handful of smaller features which are not as requested as the big one. The PO would really like to include the big feature in the next release, but the next release date is not so far away. If the PO prioritises the big feature but it’s not done in time for the already communicated release date, the release will be severely lacking and considered a failure. In that case, the PO would rather include a couple of the smaller features. A safer bet, but the payoff is smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THIS is why estimates matter so much to product owners. They must constantly run the above equation when they prioritise the teams’ backlogs. A constant risk/reward balancing act. They undoubtedly need help from the experts (the developers) to better understand the ramifications of the features they are proposing. If POs do not understand how big different work packages are, they cannot do their jobs in an effective way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It gets worse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of one PO there are now a couple of them. They are responsible for different parts of a larger product which requires the POs to coordinate both the date and the content of their releases. There is probably a main backlog describing upcoming features in the final product, as well as team backlogs where each team are assigned puzzle pieces which must be implemented and integrated in a coordinated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is painful in multiple ways, but the most obvious issue is that – in order to have a functioning release – the POs must agree on the prioritisation of the main backlog and this will in turn affect the prioritisation of the team backlogs. The POs must each acquire information about how long it will take (and how costly it will be) to implement and to integrate the puzzle piece(s) they are responsible for into a cohesive feature. The tool for acquiring this idea?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical debt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programming is a craft. An art. My art, to some extent. I’m in my happy place when I get to succumb to a tricky task and surface a couple of days later with a solution to a problem that initially seemed impossible. As a developer, I want to build the best possible product. I dislike shortcuts. Half-arsed solutions. Fixes. Not because a single shortcut or fix will destroy a product, but because the technical debt they incur will accumulate over time and eventually erode the product from the inside out; making it ever more difficult to work with it and ultimately cause it to break.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical debt is – I believe – the main reason for conflict between a PO and a development team. A not so technically inclined PO will fail to see how detrimental technical debt is to the product and how painful it is for the developers to work in a code base with a high amount of debt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put in other words: If I’m tasked with implementing a new feature and I come across something in the code that is obviously smelly, error prone, or just not very good, I want to leave the code in better shape than I found it. Not taking time to “payoff” such debt once might not be the end of the world, but the hard coded quick-fix that you know ought to be generalised will likely bite you down the road. And if you have ignored updating dependencies for a couple of months and find yourself in a situation where you need to upgrade &lt;code&gt;Package 1&lt;/code&gt;, but it depends on a newer version of
&lt;code&gt;Packages 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/code&gt;, which in turn requires a framework upgrade… Let’s just say the feature you’re working on will take
a while longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why developers HATE estimates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a PO asks: “How long will it take to implement &lt;code&gt;Feature F&lt;/code&gt;?”, they aren’t just asking the developers to estimate
the amount of time they think it will take to write the code for the feature. A good PO understands that implementing a
new feature is an iterative process and that integration hell is a thing. An even better PO understands that they are
also asking the team to estimate how many unforeseen issues they will encounter while implementing the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This detail: The unforeseen issues, which the PO asks the developers to foresee, is key. It is – per definition – not possible to foresee something unforeseeable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many developers I’ve met dislike uncertainty. One of the things they appreciate most about coding is the deterministic aspect of it. You run the same program again and again and it returns the same results.1 The journey on which we travel while writing the code is, however, not particularly deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is true, that the more you code and the more familiar you get with a codebase, the more accurate your estimates will be. However, just the other day I was working on an issue which I had estimated would take approximately two days. All of a sudden, I realised that the simple change required updating a shared component that had been tightly coupled years ago. When I touched that code, dozens of failing tests appeared, each revealing another hidden dependency. Fixing those uncovered yet another module depending on outdated patterns. Halfway through, we decided we had to refactor the entire flow just to make the original change safe. My “two-day task” turned into two weeks of archaeological software excavation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could we have solved this quicker by not caring so much about the amount of technical debt we left in our wake? Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would we have encountered a two month excavation in the future? Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It gets worse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Merriam-Webster: estimate is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To judge tentatively or approximately the value, worth, or significance of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The very definition of estimates tells us that they are either tentative or approximate. As a developer, I choose to interpret the or as meaning that it could even be both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started my career as a software developer, I really did not have an issue with estimates. We would refine our backlog and I would gladly give an estimate on various items. (1) Because I was fresh out of university and wanted to prove myself by doing a good job and not being too difficult, but more importantly: (2) because I had not understood that my estimates would soon be used against me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I soon learned that my team’s estimates were not interpreted and used as estimates. They were used as deadlines. If we broke down a feature into its reasonable components (an error prone science, which introduces uncertainties, on its own) and estimated the parts accordingly, the PO would often take the sum of the parts and communicate it to their colleagues as: “This is the time we will be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two things came out of this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My team (consisting mostly of newly graduated developers) became much more reluctant to estimate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When we estimated we always padded our actual beliefs, significantly, to give ourselves a buffer.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The estimates stopped being estimates. They became safety railings against being held accountable for unreasonable expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The clash&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you see the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you see a solution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe the overarching problem with estimates stems from expectations. Somewhere, someone, communicates something to the users/customers of the product, which sets expectations the rest of the organisation are then forced to live up to. In a small company, it might very well be the PO who does that communication but in a larger organisation the PO is likely as helpless as the developers w.r.t. having a say about the product’s roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “solution” is simple: Stop communicating new features in advance. Stop setting more or less arbitrary deadlines2. Let the PO tell the developers what features they want, in what order, and let the developers do what they do best: Code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But these deadlines are there for a reason. If your company builds a product which assists people doing their yearly tax returns, a missed delivery window will result in the entire revenue opportunity for that year being missed. Resources (most often in terms of salaries to employees) will have been poured into a project and if there’s no payoff in terms of additional sales, it could lead to a need for finding other ways to reclaim those resources; often in terms of reduced costs, which universally means: lay-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, it’s in everyone’s best interest to play along. We play the estimates game even though it’s a bad way (but also the best we know of) to help each other do our respective jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What about DevOps?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You didn’t think I’d miss an opportunity to talk about DevOps, did you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flow is a key concept within DevOps which describes an organisation’s ability to reduce bottlenecks and increase the pace at which they are able to deliver new versions of their product(s). High flow is synonymous with frequent deliveries and updates of our product(s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concepts from DevOps do not directly address the issue with estimates, but there are tools which can be used to reduce the risk associated with delivering software. Flow can inform how we tackle technical debt and how we make sure we don’t fall behind on our dependencies. Flow can also help us identify issues in our product’s life cycle as well as help us understand how to get rid of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flow is one of The Three Ways in DevOps and if you want to learn more, feel free to reach out. I give presentations on various topics related to DevOps and I can come to your company and give a course about DevOps tailored to your company’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates – as defined in the English language – isn’t really the problem here. The problem is when estimates are treated as predictions, deadlines, and used to put pressure on developers who are just trying to do their jobs. Estimates – the way they are used in our industry today – hurts people and reduces the psychological safety in our organisations. I believe we would be better off if we could work in a way that allows developers to be transparent and continuously communicate updated estimates as development progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then again, product owners are people too! As developers we must understand that POs are under pressure too. We must help them and the best way to help them is to continuously provide them with updates about how development is progressing and whether we have encountered anything that we believe will significantly alter the original estimate we gave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you ever find yourself in a situation where this is not true, you’re either dealing with concurrency or undefined behaviour – in which case all bets are off. At that point, the computer is no longer a machine, it’s a mischievous roommate. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These deadlines are more often than not informed by quarterly reports (at least in publicly traded companies), holidays, or other external events. Calling them arbitrary might be unjust. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Laptops in the Long Run: Evidence from the One Laptop per Child Program in Rural Peru&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paper examines a large-scale randomized evaluation of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program in 531 Peruvian rural primary schools. We use administrative data on academic performance and grade progression over 10 years to estimate the long-run effects of increased computer access on (i) school performance over time and (ii) students’ educational trajectories. Following schools over time, we find no significant effects on academic performance but some evidence of negative effects on grade progression. Following students over time, we find no significant effects on primary and secondary completion, academic performance in secondary school, or university enrollment. Survey data indicate that computer access significantly improved students’ computer skills but not their cognitive skills; treated teachers received some training but did not improve their digital skills and showed limited use of technology in classrooms, suggesting the need for additional pedagogical support.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Proxmox delivers its software-defined datacenter contender and VMware escape hatch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New ‘Datacenter Manager’ manages VMs across multiple sites or clusters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open source virtualization project Proxmox has delivered the first full and stable release of its Datacenter Manager product, making it a more viable alternative as a private cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proxmox’s Virtual Environment, a platform that hosts virtual machines and containers, and includes software-defined storage and networking, has become increasingly prominent in recent years as Broadcom’s VMware business unit focused on large enterprise customers. Proxmox has become a popular alternative to VMware for organizations whose needs don’t go far beyond basic server virtualization. Even one VMware partner The Register recently spoke to decided Proxmox was sufficient for some internal workloads it felt did not need all the features of VMware’s Cloud Foundation platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proxmox, however, has bigger ambitions and on Thursday started chasing them by releasing a new product called Datacenter Manager that offers centralized management for multiple, independent Proxmox-based environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As explained in Proxmox’s launch announcement, the product “… provides an aggregated view of all your connected nodes and clusters and is designed to manage complex and distributed infrastructures, from local installations to globally scaled data centers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Datacenter Manager also enables migration of VMs across clusters without having to manually reconfigure networks. That’s a trick VMware invented decades ago and has since become table stakes for serious private cloud players.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Platform9 pushes swing capacity workaround for VMware migrants&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Veeam debuts its Proxmox backup tool – and reveals outfit using it to quit VMware&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Meet the Proxinator: A hyperbox that puts SATA at the heart of VMware migrations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other features also help to make Proxmox a contender, such as VM fleet management tools that allow admins to identify VMs that need patches and arrange installation, lifecycle management for VMs, and a dashboard that allows a view of all hosts and the workloads they host – and their status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bardia Khalilifar, CEO of Australian Proxmox service provider Multiportal.io, welcomed the debut of Datacenter Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I think it is fantastic that Proxmox has released this," he said, as it will help enable service providers to manage multiple Proxmox rigs on behalf of their clients. He said the product "opens the floodgates" for wider Proxmox adoption, especially across multiple datacenters and for use in private clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH, the entity that develops Proxmox products and makes them available under the GNU AGPLv3 license, wrote Datacenter Manager in Rust. That’s no guarantee of strong security, but it’s a decent start. Proxmox’s developers based the platform on Debian Trixie 13.2, using version 6.17 of the Linux kernel, and with ZFS 2.3.4 included.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Datacenter Manager downloads are available here. If you take it for a spin, let us know how it goes! ®&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ads support content creators and free services. If you value specific creators or platforms, consider supporting them directly through memberships or donations rather than relying solely on ad blocking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Intro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I decided I'd had enough of ads. Not just the occasional banner or a quick pre-roll video — I mean all of them. They have to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I embarked on a holy crusade to get rid of them as much as possible. I tried the obvious solutions first, then dug deeper into less conventional approaches. It took a long time, tons of experiments, and many observations, but today I am finally happy where I stand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many techniques out there, some well-known and others surprisingly obscure. Here's what I learned over the years and what actually worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Tools and techniques&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start with the basics and work our way up to the more unconventional methods. The first few are straightforward and widely used. The later ones require more setup and maintenance but can block ads in places where traditional methods fail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Browser extensions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browser ad blockers are the biggest boycott in history. You're probably using one already!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Firefox with uBlock Origin — it's the best ad blocking combo out there. It's harder if you're on Chromium-based browser, since Google transitioned to Manifest V3 which conveniently limits ad blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep my filter lists minimal — they cover almost everything I need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built-in uBlock filters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EasyList&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AdGuard - Ads&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also maintain my own filters. They don't focus on ads, but rather on other annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DNS filtering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DNS filtering complements browser extensions by catching ads that slip through — particularly in mobile apps. Mobile apps typically load ads from dedicated ad-serving domains, making them straightforward to block at the DNS level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pi-hole and AdGuard Home are the most popular self-hosted options for this. If you're looking for a cloud-based solution, I don't use them myself, but I've heard good things about NextDNS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Pi-hole, and it's been smooth so far. I don't expose it publicly — instead, I connect via WireGuard and set Pi-hole as the DNS server in my WireGuard config. If you're looking for blocklists, The Firebog is a great starting point. You'll also want to maintain an allowlist — blocklists occasionally include legitimate domains that break functionality on websites or in apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to install Pi-hole, I keep it in Docker and suggest you do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;VPN via cloud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now here comes a secret ingredient. If you route all your traffic through a popular cloud provider (via VPN or proxy), then many online platforms are less likely to show you ads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That happens because to these platforms you look like a fraudster doing something sketchy with their ads. Imagine this scenario: a small business spends $1000 on ads. Their competitors figure out the targeting, mimic that behavior, spin up 10 VMs, and waste the entire advertising budget on fake interactions. The small business isn't coming back to spend more money on ads after that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Online platforms are well aware of this, so they fight fraud. Not serving ads to traffic from public cloud providers is one of the first steps they take.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this will negatively affect your experience on some sites — you'll hit Cloudflare captchas and HTTP errors due to sites blocking cloud provider IPs. I'm fine with it and just turn the VPN off occasionally when something breaks. Just keep in mind that even a few requests with your real IP might be enough for an online platform to start showing you ads again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I host WireGuard on a $5 DigitalOcean droplet, but Hetzner, Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, and others work just as well. DigitalOcean also provides a detailed guide on how to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other useful stuff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below you'll find some other useful things, although they aren't exactly related to ad-blocking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browser extensions against annoyances: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cookie popups: Consent-O-Matic&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Captchas: Buster&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I'd also suggest SponsorBlock — it has saved me so much time. There's also an option for TVs and streaming devices.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you're on iOS, consider turning off Background App Refresh. Only a few apps use Background App Refresh as Apple designed it, the majority are simply abusing it to get more data about you. If you don't have always-on VPN, you risk exposing your real IP.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Patched apps are also a thing, and it's also possible to patch mobile apps yourself via ReVanced. While it's a decent option, it's also a security risk — I'm careful with it and don't use it with sensitive accounts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Personal experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been using all these things mentioned above for over 3 years now. I barely see any ads nowadays. If you're curious about specifics, I keep track of what works where:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Platform&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Web&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;iOS / Android&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;YouTube&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NewPipe or Invidious&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;VPN via cloud (takes a week to a month)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Twitch&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;VPN via cloud (takes a few days)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;TikTok&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;VPN via cloud (takes a few hours)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Apps with AdMob&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;DNS blocking&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the tricky outliers. For most sites and apps, DNS filtering and a browser ad blocker catch 99% of ads without any extra effort. The VPN approach helps with that remaining 1%, though it usually takes time to kick in — these platforms don't make decisions based on seeing your IP once, they need to observe patterns over days or weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bag of words, have mercy on us&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OR: Claude will you go to prom with me?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look, I don’t know if AI is gonna kill us or make us all rich or whatever, but I do know we’ve got the wrong metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to understand these things as people. When you type a question to ChatGPT and it types back the answer in complete sentences, it feels like there must be a little guy in there doing the typing. We get this vivid sense of “it’s alive!!”, and we activate all of the mental faculties we evolved to deal with fellow humans: theory of mind, attribution, impression management, stereotyping, cheater detection, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can’t help it; humans are hopeless anthropomorphizers. When it comes to perceiving personhood, we’re so trigger-happy that we can see the Virgin Mary in a grilled cheese sandwich:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A human face in a slice of nematode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And an old man in a bunch of poultry and fish atop a pile of books:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this served us well in our evolutionary history—maybe it’s so important not to mistake people for things that we err on the side of mistaking things for people.1 This is probably why we’re so willing to explain strange occurrences by appealing to fantastical creatures with minds and intentions: everybody in town is getting sick because of WITCHES, you can’t see the sun right now because A WOLF ATE IT, the volcano erupted because GOD IS MAD. People who experience sleep paralysis sometimes hallucinate a demon-like creature sitting on their chest, and one explanation is that the subconscious mind is trying to understand why the body can’t move, and instead of coming up with “I’m still in REM sleep so there’s not enough acetylcholine in my brain to activate my primary motor cortex”, it comes up with “BIG DEMON ON TOP OF ME”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why the past three years have been so confusing—the little guy inside the AI keeps dumbfounding us by doing things that a human wouldn’t do. Why does he make up citations when he does my social studies homework? How come he can beat me at Go but he can’t tell me how many “r”s are in the word “strawberry”? Why is he telling me to put glue on my pizza?2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to understand LLMs by using the rules of human psychology is like trying to understand a game of Scrabble by using the rules of Pictionary. These things don’t act like people because they aren’t people. I don’t mean that in the deflationary way that the AI naysayers mean it. They think denying humanity to the machines is a well-deserved insult; I think it’s just an accurate description.3 As long we try to apply our person perception to artificial intelligence, we’ll keep being surprised and befuddled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in dire need of a better metaphor. Here’s my suggestion: instead of seeing AI as a sort of silicon homunculus, we should see it as a bag of words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;WHAT’S IN THE BAG&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AI is a bag that contains basically all words ever written, at least the ones that could be scraped off the internet or scanned out of a book. When users send words into the bag, it sends back the most relevant words it has. There are so many words in the bag that the most relevant ones are often correct and helpful, and AI companies secretly add invisible words to your queries to make this even more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an oversimplification, of course. But it’s also surprisingly handy. For example, AIs will routinely give you outright lies or hallucinations, and when you’re like “Uhh hey that was a lie”, they will immediately respond “Oh my god I’m SO SORRY!! I promise I’ll never ever do that again!! I’m turning over a new leaf right now, nothing but true statements from here on” and then they will literally lie to you in the next sentence. This would be baffling and exasperating behavior coming from a human, but it’s very normal behavior coming from a bag of words. If you toss a question into the bag and the right answer happens to be in there, that’s probably what you’ll get. If it’s not in there, you’ll get some related-but-inaccurate bolus of sentences. When you accuse it of lying, it’s going to produce lots of words from the “I’ve been accused of lying” part of the bag. Calling this behavior “malicious” or “erratic” is misleading because it’s not behavior at all, just like it’s not “behavior” when a calculator multiplies numbers for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bag of words” is a also a useful heuristic for predicting where an AI will do well and where it will fail. “Give me a list of the ten worst transportation disasters in North America” is an easy task for a bag of words, because disasters are well-documented. On the other hand, “Who reassigned the species Brachiosaurus brancai to its own genus, and when?” is a hard task for a bag of words, because the bag just doesn’t contain that many words on the topic.4 And a question like “What are the most important lessons for life?” won’t give you anything outright false, but it will give you a bunch of fake-deep pablum, because most of the text humans have produced on that topic is, no offense, fake-deep pablum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you forget that an AI is just a big bag of words, you can easily slip into acting like it’s an all-seeing glob of pure intelligence. For example, I was hanging with a group recently where one guy made everybody watch a video of some close-up magic, and after the magician made some coins disappear, he exclaimed, “I asked ChatGPT how this trick works, and even it didn’t know!” as if this somehow made the magic extra magical. In this person’s model of the world, we are all like shtetl-dwelling peasants and AI is like our Rabbi Hillel, the only learned man for 100 miles. If Hillel can’t understand it, then it must be truly profound!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that guy had instead seen ChatGPT as a bag of words, he would have realized that the bag probably doesn’t contain lots of detailed descriptions of contemporary coin tricks. After all, magicians make money from performing and selling their tricks, not writing about them at length on the internet. Plus, magic tricks are hard to describe—“He had three quarters in his hand and then it was two pennies!”—so you’re going to have a hard time prompting the right words out of the bag. The coin trick is not literally magic, and neither is the bag of words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;GALILEO GPT&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “bag of words” metaphor can also help us guess what these things are gonna do next. If you want to know whether AI will get better at something in the future, just ask: “can you fill the bag with it?” For instance, people are kicking around the idea that AI will replace human scientists. Well, if you want your bag of words to do science for you, you need to stuff it with lots of science. Can we do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to specific scientific tasks, yes, we already can. If you fill the bag with data from 170,000 proteins, for example, it’ll do a pretty good job predicting how proteins will fold. Fill the bag with chemical reactions and it can tell you how to synthesize new molecules. Fill the bag with journal articles and then describe an experiment and it can tell you whether anyone has already scooped you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of that is cool, and I expect more of it in the future. I don’t think we’re far from a bag of words being able to do an entire low-quality research project from beginning to end—coming up with a hypothesis, designing the study, running it, analyzing the results, writing them up, making the graphs, arranging it all on a poster, all at the click of a button—because we’ve got loads of low-quality science to put in the bag. If you walk up and down the poster sessions at a psychology conference, you can see lots of first-year PhD students presenting studies where they seemingly pick some semi-related constructs at random, correlate them, and print out a p-value (“Does self-efficacy moderate the relationship between social dominance orientation and system-justifying beliefs?”). A bag of words can basically do this already; you just need to give it access to an online participant pool and a big printer.5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But science is a strong-link problem; if we produced a million times more crappy science, we’d be right where we are now. If we want more of the good stuff, what should we put in the bag? You could stuff the bag with papers, but some of them are fraudulent, some are merely mistaken, and all of them contain unstated assumptions that could turn out to be false. And they’re usually missing key information—they don’t share the data, or they don’t describe their methods in adequate detail. Markus Strasser, an entrepreneur who tried to start one of those companies that’s like “we’ll put every scientific paper in the bag and then ??? and then profit”, eventually abandoned the effort, saying that “close to nothing of what makes science actually work is published as text on the web.”6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s one way to think about it: if there had been enough text to train an LLM in 1600, would it have scooped Galileo? My guess is no. Ask that early modern ChatGPT whether the Earth moves and it will helpfully tell you that experts have considered the possibility and ruled it out. And that’s by design. If it had started claiming that our planet is zooming through space at 67,000mph, its dutiful human trainers would have punished it: “Bad computer!! Stop hallucinating!!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, an early 1600s bag of words wouldn’t just have the right words in the wrong order. At the time, the right words didn’t exist. As the historian of science David Wootton points out7, when Galileo was trying to describe his discovery of the moons of Jupiter, none of the languages he knew had a good word for “discover”. He had to use awkward circumlocutions like “I saw something unknown to all previous astronomers before me”. The concept of learning new truths by looking through a glass tube would have been totally foreign to an LLM of the early 1600s, as it was to most of the people of the early 1600s, with a few notable exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You would get better scientific descriptions from a 2025 bag of words than you would from a 1600 bag of words. But both bags might be equally bad at producing the scientific ideas of their respective futures. Scientific breakthroughs often require doing things that are irrational and unreasonable for the standards of the time and good ideas usually look stupid when they first arrive, so they are often—with good reason!—rejected, dismissed, and ignored. This is a big problem for a bag of words that contains all of yesterday’s good ideas. Putting new ideas in the bag will often make the bag worse, on average, because most of those new ideas will be wrong. That’s why revolutionary research requires not only intelligence, but also stupidity. I expect humans to remain usefully stupider than bags of words for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;CLAUDE WILL U GO TO PROM WITH ME?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important part of the “bag of words” metaphor is that it prevents us from thinking about AI in terms of social status. Our ancestors had to play status games well enough to survive and reproduce—losers, by and large, don’t get to pass on their genes. This has left our species exquisitely attuned to who’s up and who’s down. Accordingly, we can turn anything into a competition: cheese rolling, nettle eating, phone throwing, toe wrestling, and ferret legging, where male contestants, sans underwear, put live ferrets in their pants for as long as they can. (The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we personify AI, we mistakenly make it a competitor in our status games. That’s why we’ve been arguing about artificial intelligence like it’s a new kid in school: is she cool? Is she smart? Does she have a crush on me? The better AIs have gotten, the more status-anxious we’ve become. If these things are like people, then we gotta know: are we better or worse than them? Will they be our masters, our rivals, or our slaves? Is their art finer, their short stories tighter, their insights sharper than ours? If so, there’s only one logical end: ultimately, we must either kill them or worship them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a bag of words is not a spouse, a sage, a sovereign, or a serf. It’s a tool. Its purpose is to automate our drudgeries and amplify our abilities. Its social status is NA; it makes no sense to ask whether it’s “better” than us. The real question is: does using it make us better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m not afraid of being rendered obsolete by a bag of words. Machines have already matched or surpassed humans on all sorts of tasks. A pitching machine can throw a ball faster than a human can, spellcheck gets the letters right every time, and autotune never sings off key. But we don’t go to baseball games, spelling bees, and Taylor Swift concerts for the speed of the balls, the accuracy of the spelling, or the pureness of the pitch. We go because we care about humans doing those things. It wouldn’t be interesting to watch a bag of words do them—unless we mistakenly start treating that bag like it’s a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(That’s also why I see no point in using AI to, say, write an essay, just like I see no point in bringing a forklift to the gym. Sure, it can lift the weights, but I’m not trying to suspend a barbell above the floor for the hell of it. I lift it because I want to become the kind of person who can lift it. Similarly, I write because I want to become the kind of person who can think.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean I’m unafraid of AI entirely. I’m plenty afraid! Any tool can be dangerous when used the wrong way—nail guns and nuclear reactors can kill people just fine without having a mind inside them. In fact, the “bag of words” metaphor makes it clear that AI can be dangerous precisely because it doesn’t operate like humans do. The dangers we face from humans are scary but familiar: hotheaded humans might kick you in the head, reckless humans might drink and drive, duplicitous humans might pretend to be your friend so they can steal your identity. We can guard against these humans because we know how they operate. But we don’t know what’s gonna come out of the bag of words. For instance, if you show humans computer code that has security vulnerabilities, they do not suddenly start praising Hitler. But LLMs do.8 So yes, I would worry about putting the nuclear codes in the bag.9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;C’MON BERTIE&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has owned an old car has been tempted to interpret its various malfunctions as part of its temperament. When it won’t start on a cold day, it feels like the appropriate response is to plead, the same way you would with a sleepy toddler or a tardy partner: “C’mon Bertie, we gotta get to the dentist!” But ultimately, person perception is a poor guide to vehicle maintenance. Cars are made out of metal and plastic that turn gasoline into forward motion; they are not made out of bones and meat that turn Twinkies into thinking. If you want to fix a broken car, you need a wrench, a screwdriver, and a blueprint, not a cognitive-behavioral therapy manual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, anyone who sees a mind inside the bag of words has fallen for a trick. They’ve had their evolution exploited. Their social faculties are firing not because there’s a human in front of them, but because natural selection gave those faculties a hair trigger. For all of human history, something that talked like a human and walked like a human was, in fact, a human. Soon enough, something that talks and walks like a human may, in fact, be a very sophisticated logistic regression. If we allow ourselves to be seduced by the superficial similarity, we’ll end up like the moths who evolved to navigate by the light of the moon, only to find themselves drawn to—and ultimately electrocuted by—the mysterious glow of a bug zapper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike moths, however, we aren’t stuck using the instincts that natural selection gave us. We can choose the schemas we use to think about technology. We’ve done it before: we don’t refer to a backhoe as an “artificial digging guy” or a crane as an “artificial tall guy”. We don’t think of books as an “artificial version of someone talking to you”, photographs as “artificial visual memories”, or listening to recorded sound as “attending an artificial recital”. When pocket calculators debuted, they were already smarter than every human on Earth, at least when it comes to calculation—a job that itself used to be done by humans. Folks wondered whether this new technology was “a tool or a toy”, but nobody seems to have wondered whether it was a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(If you covered a backhoe with skin, made its bucket look like a hand, painted eyes on its chassis, and made it play a sound like “hnngghhh!” whenever it lifted something heavy, then we’d start wondering whether there’s a ghost inside the machine. That wouldn’t tell us anything about backhoes, but it would tell us a lot about our own psychology.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original sin of artificial intelligence was, of course, calling it artificial intelligence. Those two words have lured us into making man the measure of machine: “Now it’s as smart as an undergraduate...now it’s as smart as a PhD!” These comparisons only give us the illusion of understanding AI’s capabilities and limitations, as well as our own, because we don’t actually know what it means to be smart in the first place. Our definitions of intelligence are either wrong (“Intelligence is the ability to solve problems”) or tautological (“Intelligence is the ability to do things that require intelligence”).10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unfortunate that the computer scientists figured out how to make something that kinda looks like intelligence before the psychologists could actually figure out what intelligence is, but here we are. There’s no putting the cat back in the bag now. It won’t fit—there’s too many words in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS it’s been a busy week on Substack—&lt;/p&gt;and I discussed why people get so anxious about conversations, and how to have better ones:&lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;at Can't Get Much Higher answered all of my questions about music. He uncovered some surprising stuff, including an issue that caused a civil war on a Beatles message board, and whether they really sang naughty words on the radio in the 1970s:&lt;p&gt;Derek and Chris both run terrific Substacks, check ‘em out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classic demonstration of this is the Heider &amp;amp; Simmel video from 1944 where you can’t help but feel like the triangles and the circle have minds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that AI models don’t make mistakes like these nearly as often as they did even a year ago, which is another strangely inhuman attribute. If a real person told me to put glue on my pizza, I’m probably never going to trust them again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, hating these things so much actually gives them humanity. Our greatest hate is always reserved for fellow humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, ChatGPT now does much better on this question, in part by using the very post that criticizes its earlier performance. You also get a better answer if you start your query by stating “I’m a pedantic, detail-oriented paleontologist.” This is classic bag-of-words behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or you could save time and money by allowing the AI to make up the data itself, which is a time-honored tradition in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was written in 2021, so bag-technology has improved a lot since then. But even the best bag in the world isn’t very useful if you don’t have the right things to put inside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p. 58 in my version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other weird effects: being polite to the LLMs makes them sometimes better and some times worse at math. But adding “Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives” to the prompt consistently makes them worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of this metaphor is that we could refer to “AI Safety” as “securing the bag”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the word “artificial” is wrong, because it menacingly implies replacement. Artificial sweeteners, flowers, legs—these are things we only use when we can’t have the real deal. So what part of intelligence, exactly, are we so intent on replacing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 7, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month, Toyota hastily settled an Unintended Acceleration lawsuit – hours after an Oklahoma jury determined that the automaker acted with “reckless disregard,” and delivered a $3 million verdict to the plaintiffs – but before the jury could determine punitive damages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What did the jury hear that constituted such a gross neglect of Toyota’s due care obligations? The testimony of two plaintiff’s experts in software design and the design process gives some eye-popping clues. After reviewing Toyota’s software engineering process and the source code for the 2005 Toyota Camry, both concluded that the system was defective and dangerous, riddled with bugs and gaps in its failsafes that led to the root cause of the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bookout and Schwarz v. Toyota emanated from a September 2007 UA event that caused a fatal crash. Jean Bookout and her friend and passenger Barbara Schwarz were exiting Interstate Highway 69 in Oklahoma, when she lost throttle control of her 2005 Camry. When the service brakes would not stop her speeding sedan, she threw the parking brake, leaving a 150-foot skid mark from right rear tire, and a 25-foot skid mark from the left. The Camry, however, continued speeding down the ramp and across the road at the bottom, crashing into an embankment. Schwarz died of her injuries; Bookout spent five months recovering from head and back injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attorney Graham Esdale, of Beasley Allen, who represented the plaintiffs is the first to say that the Bookout verdict – in some measure – rested on those two black skid marks scoring the off- ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Toyota just couldn’t explain those away,” Esdale said. “The skid marks showed that she was braking.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The jury was very attentive, despite the technical discussions that dominated the testimony. After the jury learned that the case had been settled, jurors asked Judge Patricia Parrish if they could stay and discuss the trial. A dozen jurors, Judge Parrish, and the plaintiff’s lawyers discussed it. Esdale says that it was obvious from that conversation that the jury was poised to punish Toyota for its conduct and cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skid marks notwithstanding, two of the plaintiffs’ software experts, Phillip Koopman, and Michael Barr, provided fascinating insights into the myriad problems with Toyota’s software development process and its source code – possible bit flips, task deaths that would disable the failsafes, memory corruption, single-point failures, inadequate protections against stack overflow and buffer overflow, single-fault containment regions, thousands of global variables. The list of deficiencies in process and product was lengthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael Barr, a well-respected embedded software specialist, spent more than 20 months reviewing Toyota’s source code at one of five cubicles in a hotel-sized room, supervised by security guards, who ensured that entrants brought no paper in or out, and wore no belts or watches. Barr testified about the specifics of Toyota’s source code, based on his 800-page report. Phillip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University professor in computer engineering, a safety critical embedded systems specialist, authored a textbook, Better Embedded System Software, and performs private industry embedded software design reviews – including in the automotive industry – testified about Toyota’s engineering safety process. Both used a programmer’s derisive term for what they saw: spaghetti code – badly written and badly structured source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barr testified:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a large number of functions that are overly complex. By the standard industry metrics some of them are untestable, meaning that it is so complicated a recipe that there is no way to develop a reliable test suite or test methodology to test all the possible things that can happen in it. Some of them are even so complex that they are what is called unmaintainable, which means that if you go in to fix a bug or to make a change, you’re likely to create a new bug in the process. Just because your car has the latest version of the firmware — that is what we call embedded software — doesn’t mean it is safer necessarily than the older one….And that conclusion is that the failsafes are inadequate. The failsafes that they have contain defects or gaps. But on the whole, the safety architecture is a house of cards. It is possible for a large percentage of the failsafes to be disabled at the same time that the throttle control is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even a Toyota programmer described the engine control application as “spaghetti-like” in an October 2007 document Barr read into his testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Koopman was highly critical of Toyota’s computer engineering process. The accepted, albeit voluntary, industry coding standards were first set by Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA) in 1995. Accompanying these rules is an industry metric, which equates broken rules with the introduction of a number of software bugs: For every 30 rule violations, you can expect on average three minor bugs and one major bug. Toyota made a critical mistake in declining to follow those standards, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When NASA software engineers evaluated parts of Toyota’s source code during their NHTSA contracted review in 2010, they checked 35 of the MISRA-C rules against the parts of the Toyota source to which they had access and found 7,134 violations. Barr checked the source code against MISRA’s 2004 edition and found 81,514 violations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Toyota substituted its own process, which had little overlap with the industry standard. Even so, Toyota’s programmers often broke their own rules. And they failed to keep adequate track of their departures from those rules – and the justification for doing so, which is also standard practice. Koopman testified that if safety is not baked into the recipe in the process of creating the product, it cannot be added later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You have to exercise great care when you’re doing safety critical software. You can’t just wing it. And Toyota exercised some care, but they did not reach the level of accepted practice in how you need to design safety critical systems,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest safety standards Toyota broke was allowing single point failures within its system. (Single point failure refers to a piece of hardware or software that has complete control over whether a system is safe or not—such as a single-engine airplane.) Koopman testified:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If there is a single point of failure, by every safety standard I have ever seen, it is by definition unsafe, and no amount of countermeasures, no amount of failsafes will fix that. They will reduce how often it happens, but it won’t completely fix it. Because we have millions of vehicles out there, it will find a way to fail that you didn’t think of, and it will fail.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other egregious deviations from standard practice were the number of global variables in the system. (A variable is a location in memory that has a number in it. A global variable is any piece of software anywhere in the system can get to that number and read it or write it.) The academic standard is zero. Toyota had more than 10,000 global variables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And in practice, five, ten, okay, fine. 10,000, no, we’re done. It is not safe, and I don’t need to see all 10,000 global variables to know that that is a problem,” Koopman testified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other important design process errors Barr and Koopman identified were an absence of a peer code review, and Toyota’s failure to check the source code of its second CPU, supplied by Denso —even as executives assured Congress and NHTSA that the cause of UA couldn’t be in the engine software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barr testified to some of the vehicle behavior malfunctions caused by the death of tasks within the CPU, and concluded that Bookout’s UA was more likely than not caused by the death of a redacted-name task, called Task X at trial. Barr dubbed it “the kitchen-sink” task, because it controlled a lot of the vehicle’s functions, including throttle control; the cruise control – turning it on, maintain the speed and turning it off – and many of the failsafes on the main CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was critical of Toyota watchdog supervisor – software to detect the death of a task — design. He testified that Toyota’s watchdog supervisor “is incapable of ever detecting the death of a major task. That’s its whole job. It doesn’t do it. It’s not designed to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, Toyota designed it to monitor CPU overload, and, Barr testified: “it doesn’t even do that right. CPU overload is when there’s too much work in a burst, a period of time to do all the tasks. If that happens for too long, the car can become dangerous because tasks not getting to use the CPU is like temporarily tasks dying.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barr also testified that Toyota’s software threw away error codes from the operating system, ignoring codes identifying a problem with a task. At trial, Barr said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And task death, although I focused a lot of task X here, because it does so much and it does throttle control and it does failsafe, it’s pretty important, but there is [redacted] tasks and they can die in different combinations. It could be task 3 and task X, or task 3and task 7 and task X, or just task 9. And those can cause an unpredictable range of vehicle misbehaviors. It turns out that unintended acceleration is just the most dangerous thing your car can do when it malfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you were to dismiss their conclusions as nothing but paid-for expert testimony, Koopman and Barr’s assessment about software errors as a possible UA root cause go a long way in explaining so much: how Toyota’s system could fail and leave no trace; why we are still seeing UAs in late model Toyota vehicles and why Toyota can’t seem to fix it with floor mat and pedal recalls; how it could get away with hiding some of the root causes of UA events for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their descriptions of the incredible complexity of Toyota’s software also explain why NHTSA has reacted the way it has and why NASA never found a flaw it could connect to a Toyota’s engine going to a wide open throttle, ignoring the driver’s commands to stop and not set a diagnostic trouble code. For one, Barr testified, the NASA engineers were time limited, and did not have access to all of the source code. They relied on Toyota’s representations – and in some cases, Toyota misled NASA. For example, NASA was under the false belief that Toyota had designed in hardware bit flip protections called Error Detection and Correction Codes, (EDAC). The 2005 Camry for example did not have EDAC, Barr testified, but in an email Toyota told NASA that it did. At trial he said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA didn’t know that that wasn’t there. It wasn’t there in the 2005 Camry. And so if the bit-flip occurred, there would be no hardware mechanism to find it. And if it occurred in a critical value that was not mirrored, there would be no software protections against it. So the conclusion here is that there are critical variables in which bits could flip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their testimony explains why it would be near impossible for NHTSA to ever pin an electronic failure on a problem buried in software. NHTSA didn’t even have any software engineers on ODI’s staff during the myriad Toyota UA investigations. They have no real expertise on the complexities that actually underpin all of the safety-critical vehicle functions of today’s cars. It’s as if ODI engineers are investigating with an abacus, a chisel and a stone tablet. One begins to understand the agency’s stubborn doubling, tripling, quadrupaling down on floor mats and old ladies as explanations for UA events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if NHTSA did have this expertise, the software piece is so complex ODI would never have the time or budget to assess an automaker’s source code. This is why we keep harping on the need for NHTSA to write a functional safety regulation – under its own steam or Congressional mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are posting preliminary drafts of Koopman’s (part 1 and part 2) and Barr’s trial testimony, along with Barr’s slides – long, but well worth a read for anyone interested in understanding more about embedded software systems in automobiles and how not to design one; where NHTSA went wrong: and the unbelievably shaky software at the foundation of Toyota’s electronic architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally, one associates a company’s desire to shield trade secrets with the protection of something valuable. That something, one presumes, is the technology itself — the secret recipe a company uses in making its product. Rather than protecting the automotive equivalent of formula for Coke, the testimony of Koopman and Barr suggest that Toyota really wanted to hide was its formula for disaster. Consider the contents of a September 2007 email among Toyota employees:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“‘In truth technology such as failsafe is not part of the Toyota’s engineering division’s DNA,’ ” Barr read in court. “And it continues, ‘But isn’t it good that it is recognized as one of the major strengths of Toyota and its system controls industry.’ And then I highlighted also the portion that says, ‘Continuing on as is would not be a good thing.’”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
