    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage is a new next-generation storage architecture: a distributed block layer that reimagines systems like EBS, combining zero-copy forks, true elasticity, and synchronous replication. Because it operates at the block layer, Fluid Storage is fully compatible with Postgres, and even with other databases and file systems as well. Every database in Tiger Cloud’s free tier now runs on Fluid Storage, giving developers direct access to these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try it now: Get started instantly with the Tiger CLI and MCP Server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partner with us: If you’re building an agentic or infrastructure platform, we’re opening early-access partnerships. Please get in touch to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are the new developers, and they need a new storage layer built for how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents spin up environments, test code, and evolve systems continuously. They need storage that can do the same: forking, scaling, and provisioning instantly, without manual work or waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Storage itself has evolved through eras: from static systems built for durability, to dynamic systems built for elasticity through innovations like separating compute from storage. But today’s “elastic” infrastructure isn’t truly elastic. After operating tens of thousands of Postgres instances in Tiger Cloud, we’ve seen those limits firsthand: systems that scale slowly, waste capacity, and block iteration. We’re now entering the era of fluid systems: storage that moves as continuously as the workloads it serves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage was built for that world: where data flows, systems iterate autonomously, and elasticity and iteration converge into a single operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At its core, Fluid Storage is a distributed block layer that unifies these properties through a disaggregated architecture. It combines a horizontally scalable NVMe-backed block store, a proxy layer that exposes copy-on-write volumes, and a user-space storage device driver that makes it all look like a local disk to PostgreSQL. The result: instant forks and snapshots, automatic scaling up or down, and no downtime or over-provisioning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each Fluid Storage cluster manages tens of thousands of volumes across workloads and tenants—from ephemeral sandboxes to production-scale systems—with consistent performance and predictable cost. In benchmark testing, a single volume sustains 110,000+ IOPS and 1.4 GB/s throughput while retaining all copy-on-write and elasticity guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s storage that looks like a local disk but scales like a cloud service. A new storage foundation for the age of agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage now runs every free-tier database in Tiger Cloud, giving every developer (and agent) a firsthand experience of what truly fluid infrastructure feels like. Sign up in the Tiger console or get started instantly with the Tiger CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elastic storage isn’t truly elastic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every engineer who’s managed databases at scale has seen it firsthand. A CI pipeline stalls waiting for a restore. A schema migration hangs mid-run because the database can’t be safely cloned. A “resize volume” request on EBS sits in “optimizing” for hours. A database read replica lags for days behind a write-heavy primary. You wait, sometimes all day, not because Postgres is slow, but because the storage substrate beneath it isn’t nearly as elastic as it claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloud storage solved many problems, but true elasticity wasn’t one of them. Amazon EBS, for instance, is billed as elastic, yet volumes can only grow once every six to twenty-four hours. You can’t shrink them, and every operation that changes IOPS or throughput has a similar cooldown. Worse, you pay for the space you allocate, not what you actually use. To avoid running out of disk, you over-provision, and that excess sits idle, wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This rigidity made sense in the first two eras of storage. The static era focused on durability: keeping data alive across hardware failures. The dynamic era focused on decoupling compute and storage so each could scale independently. Both have become table stakes. We believe that the next era is the fluid era: storage that scales, forks, and contracts instantly. Not just incrementally elastic, but continuous. Storage that behaves more like software than hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The arrival of agents makes this shift urgent. Agents create, modify, and deploy code autonomously. They spin up sandboxes, run migrations, benchmark results, and tear everything down again, all in seconds. Each agent needs its own isolated, ephemeral environment, but with the performance and durability of production, operating on production data. This is not just experimentation; this is how agents work. Traditional storage can’t keep up with that pace or economics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage was built for this reality: a distributed block store that unifies elasticity, iteration, and durability in a single substrate. It treats scaling and forking as standard operations, not exceptions. To Postgres, it looks like a normal disk. In truth, it’s a disaggregated system that delivers high throughput, fast recovery, and instant forks—storage that finally moves as fluidly as the systems built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage already now serves as the default substrate for our recently-announced free database service on Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past five years, we’ve managed tens of thousands of Postgres instances in Tiger Cloud and seen firsthand the limitations of today’s “elastic” cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we launched Tiger Cloud in 2020, we built on Amazon EBS as our durable storage. It was reliable, well-understood, and integrated neatly with the rest of AWS. But as our fleet scaled into the thousands of customers, the limitations of EBS became clear across five dimensions: cost, scale-up performance, scale-down performance, elasticity, and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EBS charges for allocation, not usage. A database storing 200 GB of data on a 1 TB provisioned volume still pays for the full terabyte. Tiger Cloud hides this complexity from users—we bill for storage consumed, not allocated—but that simply shifts the inefficiency from the user to us. It becomes a COGS problem instead of a usability one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To manage it, we built adaptive algorithms that estimate a “good” allocation size based on each user’s consumption and rate of change. In practice, this was a constant balancing act: undershoot and risk running out of disk; overshoot and pay for unused capacity. For safety and user experience, we erred on the side of over-allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem of EBS cost only compounds as customers scale their services horizontally: every read replica doubles the storage cost, since EBS charges per volume, not per dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This cost impacts both sides: vendors through higher COGS, and customers through higher storage prices (which is why usage-based storage always costs more than allocation-based pricing on a per gigabyte basis).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale-up performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EBS volumes impose fixed ceilings on performance. Until recently, gp3 volumes topped out at 16,000 IOPS and 16 TB per volume, while io2 volumes offered higher limits—up to 64,000 IOPS and 64 TB—but at far higher cost. Those gp3 limits have recently improved, but they also don’t address another scaling challenge: the difficulty of scaling horizontally through snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally, you’d take a volume snapshot and use it to initialize a new read replica, seeding it with an exact copy of data before WAL replay begins. In theory, EBS snapshots allow this. In practice, they hydrate slowly. A restored snapshot appears immediately available, but data is fetched lazily from S3, so the replica experiences high read latency until the volume is fully loaded. We implement pre-warming strategies informed by a database’s real usage statistics, but these are effective primarily for small databases. For large, mission-critical ones, pre-warming the full working set simply takes too long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our experience operating Tiger Cloud, it was often faster to spin up a database from a Postgres backup stored in S3 than from an EBS snapshot in S3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale-down performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EBS also limits how many volumes can attach to a single EC2 instance, currently twenty-four. While Tiger Cloud runs a containerized environment, this cap directly constrains how many database services we can host per server. It makes it difficult to run large numbers of small, mostly idle instances in a cost-efficient way. In effect, EBS became a bottleneck for building a true free tier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternative for a free or low-cost tier that avoided isolated containers and volumes per service—packing multiple logical databases into a single PostgreSQL cluster—would have introduced operational trade-offs we wanted to avoid: little performance isolation, poor backup and restore options, and difficult seamless scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EBS technically supports resizing, but only once every 6–24 hours. That cooldown applies not just to disk capacity increases, but also to any changes in IOPS or throughput. Further, you can grow capacity, but you can’t shrink, and you can’t adjust continuously. We constantly fought these limitations when running our adaptive auto-disk-scaling algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is a system that simulates elasticity rather than embodying it, and these limitations ultimately leaked through to the user experience. (You see similar elasticity limitations in other managed database platforms, e.g., Supabase.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Failure recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational recovery was another bottleneck. In theory, we could detach a failed volume and reattach it to a new node to restore service quickly, even for users who weren’t paying for full HA replication due to cost concerns. In practice, “clean” shutdowns from EBS worked fast (10s of seconds), but any hard failure can often take 10–20 minutes before the EBS volume detaches and becomes available for remounting elsewhere. That delay compounded user downtime precisely when fast recovery mattered most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents further expose these limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents make these limitations even sharper. They often operate on sandboxed replicas of production to avoid risk, scale up to work, and scale down just as fast when done. Their workloads are ephemeral, demanding storage that can respond instantly. When many agents work on the same data in parallel, cost efficiency becomes critical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we began exploring agents for both internal and customer use, it became clear that today’s cloud infrastructure needed to be rethought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternative architectures we discarded&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also evaluated other architectures—most notably local NVMe and Aurora-like page-server systems—but ultimately set them aside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local NVMe (e.g., as offered by PlanetScale Metal) offered the raw performance we wanted, but not the durability. If an instance fails, the data disappears with it. To compensate, every customer would need a two-or three-node database cluster for redundancy, which we found cost-prohibitive. NVMe also lacks true storage elasticity: scaling a multi-terabyte service requires copying terabytes of data to a new node and failing over, a process that takes hours or even days. Spinning up a read replica is equally slow. The throughput and latency numbers look impressive in isolation, and NVMe remains a great substrate for caching, but it revives the pre-cloud model—dedicated boxes with fixed compute and disk—which isn’t the foundation for an elastic, managed database platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another option was a distributed page-server architecture, first introduced by Amazon Aurora and later adopted by Neon and Google AlloyDB. These systems replace PostgreSQL’s local storage layer with remote operations to a distributed page-storage service that stores pages remotely and uses a separate distributed log for write-ahead logging. It’s an elegant design for elasticity, but it comes at a cost: achieving this requires forking PostgreSQL and rewriting significant portions of its storage internals to communicate with the new remote layer. That coupling introduces real risks. Maintaining parity with upstream PostgreSQL becomes a constant need as new versions evolve; features that depend on storage semantics must be reimplemented and/or revalidated; and debugging and performance tuning also shift from a well-understood ecosystem to a proprietary one. And the result is a database-specific system, rather than a general-purpose storage substrate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We chose to solve these problems at the storage layer. Elasticity, durability, and iteration should be properties of the underlying substrate, not features baked into a single database engine. By working at the block-storage level, we could keep PostgreSQL unchanged while making the system extensible to any workload that runs on disks. A forkable storage layer offers a more general foundation: volumes that can be cloned, branched, or scaled independently of the systems that use them (and not limited to Postgres databases).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage emerged from that design choice. A distributed system built for strong durability, true elasticity, and zero-copy forks. It charges for storage consumed, not allocated, and scales fluidly in both directions. Not a faster EBS, but a storage system re-architected for true elasticity and native iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we set out to design our storage architecture, the goal wasn’t just to make storage faster. It was to make it behave differently, to meet the evolving needs of existing workloads and the new needs of agentic workloads. We focused on six core objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fork-first. Forks, clones, and snapshots aren’t exceptional operations; they’re primitives. Copy-on-write happens at the block layer, and creating a new volume or database fork is a highly-efficient metadata update, not a data copy. With such capabilities, one can quickly branch full data environments and test changes in isolation, all without copying or reloading data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Truly elastic, in both directions. Volumes can scale up or down fluidly, adapting to changing workloads and costs. Storage expands as data grows and contracts as it’s deleted or pruned. Developers or platform operators no longer need to over-provision storage based on future need, and are not prevented from downscaling if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usage-based and resource-efficient. You pay for what you use, not what you allocate. Fluid Storage’s multi-tenant design automatically reclaims unused space. Efficiency comes from the architecture itself, not by hiding platform-level waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predictable performance. Elasticity shouldn’t mean variability. Fluid maintains stable latency and throughput across tenants through intelligent scheduling and load-balanced data sharding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Postgres-compatible foundation. Applications see a normal Linux block storage device, so PostgreSQL—and any other database or file system—runs unmodified. This ensures immediate compatibility with existing tooling and software systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built for both developers and platforms. A single developer can spin up a fork per commit; a platform operator can run thousands of Fluid-backed databases, each isolated, elastic, and cost efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next section describes how the architecture implements them in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage consists of three cooperating layers, each designed to make elasticity and iteration first-class operations within the storage substrate itself, not conveniences layered on top.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage consists of three cooperating layers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lowest layer of Fluid Storage is the DBS, a transactional distributed key-value store that provides elastic, horizontally scalable block storage. DBS runs on local NVMe drives for performance. Volumes are divided into shards, each shard mapped to a replica set within the cluster. This architecture allows a single logical volume to scale seamlessly by spreading I/O across shards (and therefore many block servers) in the cluster. Cluster capacity can be dynamically increased or decreased without downtime by adding or removing DBS block servers, and shards are rebalanced transparently across the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DBS maps block addresses (keys) to disk blocks (values). Every write is versioned, allowing old and new values to coexist until garbage collection reclaims the obsolete ones. Transactions provide atomicity and consistency. Data is replicated synchronously across multiple DBS replicas as part of each write operation, ensuring strong consistency and availability. A single DBS cluster can typically manage 100s of TBs of logical storage—the data visible to clients—while the underlying physical storage is larger to accommodate replication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is a durable, multi-tenant, horizontally scalable storage layer that supports versioned block writes and enables efficient copy-on-write behavior above it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above DBS sits a layer of storage proxies, which present virtual volumes to clients and coordinate all I/O. The proxies translate network block operations into DBS reads and writes, manage volume lineage, and enforce per-volume performance and capacity limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each volume in Fluid Storage maintains metadata that tracks which blocks exist in which generation of a volume. This metadata defines the lineage of the volume and enables efficient copy-on-write across snapshots and forks. This metadata answers whether a specific block ID exists in a given generation of volume, yet only adds roughly 0.003% overhead, small enough to retain in memory for fast querying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a snapshot is taken, the system increments the parent volume's generation number (say, 6), and the child volume is created starting at that same new generation number (6). The child stores which previous parent generation it was forked from (5), establishing its lineage. Both parent and child now have their own separate generation directories for future writes. They also maintain separate block metadata for their current generation (6), but have the same information for previous generations (0 through 5). This allows the child to locate and read all of the parent's data without copying any actual blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On writes, the proxy allocates a new block in DBS tagged with its volume's current generation number, updates that generation's directory to map the block ID to the new data location, and marks the block as present in that generation. Data from earlier generations remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On reads, the system traverses generations from newest to oldest, checking the block metadata for each generation to see if the block exists there. It stops at the first generation where the block is found and reads from that generation's data. This lookup completes in microseconds, as checking membership is extremely fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This lineage mechanism allows multiple volumes to safely share unmodified blocks. Snapshots are fast and storage-efficient, adding only metadata overhead. Forks are similarly fast and zero-copy, duplicating snapshot mappings without data movement. Physical storage grows only as data diverges and new blocks are written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The storage proxy also provides control and safety at the system boundary. It authenticates clients, maintains secure isolation between tenants, and can enforce per-volume IOPS and storage limits. It can cache frequently accessed blocks to improve locality, though caching is an optimization rather than a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because agents often spin up parallel instances of themselves, consistency management had to be lightweight, version-aware, and tolerant of many concurrent forks operating on shared data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these responsibilities make the storage proxy the coordination and lineage layer of Fluid Storage. It’s the component that turns distributed blocks into coherent volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL expects a block device. Rewriting its storage engine to speak a custom API would break decades of compatibility. So instead, we integrated at the kernel boundary through a user-space storage device driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The storage device driver exposes Fluid Storage volumes as standard Linux block devices mountable with filesystems such as ext4 or xfs. It manages multiple I/O queues pinned to CPU cores for concurrency, supports zero-copy operations when possible, and allows volumes to be resized dynamically while online. It also provides device recovery primitives which massively simplify our rollouts and error recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because this integration happens at the Linux block layer, Fluid Storage can leverage existing OS-level mechanisms for resource control. Per-volume IOPS and throughput limits can be managed through the Linux environment—using cgroups or similar controls—allowing predictable performance isolation without requiring specialized kernel modifications. Additionally, we can also rely on kernel tools for monitoring and testing our block device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, this design also means Fluid Storage inherits advances from the broader ecosystem. PostgreSQL 18 introduced support for Linux io_uring, which significantly improves asynchronous I/O throughput, and Linux continues to evolve its block and memory subsystems in similar ways. Because Fluid Storage operates at this layer, it already benefits from recent PostgreSQL and Linux improvements and will continue to inherit future performance gains automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within our Kubernetes infrastructure we seamlessly integrate with our existing orchestration software, because Fluid Storage is presented as a storage class. This enables operations such as resizing volumes or taking Postgres-consistent snapshots to work out-of-the-box, similar to how they function on EBS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Putting these three layers together, one can trace read and write operations in the system. In this case, from the perspective of PostgreSQL backed by Fluid Storage as its underlying block storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read Path&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write Path&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this describes the basic I/O flow, it omits the mechanisms that can improve performance and predictability, such as block caching at either the local instance (through the user-space device driver) or the storage proxy, and management of volume IOPS and throughput at both layers. These controls don’t alter the high-level behavior of Fluid Storage; they make the system more efficient, responsive, and predictable under varying workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To PostgreSQL, Fluid Storage simply appears as a local disk. Underneath, it is a disaggregated storage system that scales elastically, replicates safely, and supports fast zero-copy forks. All while maintaining standard block storage semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Architecture is meaningful only in what it enables. In Fluid Storage, the results appear along two dimensions: the technical properties that define how the system behaves, and the developer outcomes that emerge from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forkability and snapshots: Snapshots are metadata-only and complete very quickly, regardless of volume size. Forks are writable snapshots: they start as zero-copy, then store just the blocks that are updated from its parent snapshot. Storage grows only as data diverges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ran microbenchmarks on the Fluid Storage layer to measure end-to-end latency for snapshot and fork creation as handled by the storage proxy, across volumes ranging from 1 GB to 100 GB. In all cases, both operations completed within roughly 500–600 milliseconds. These measurements exclude orchestration time (e.g., Kubernetes provisioning and mounting a new volume at a client) and any application-level coordination that may precede a snapshot, such as issuing a PostgreSQL checkpoint. They represent the raw efficiency of the underlying storage system—the baseline latency achievable for instant forks and snapshots under normal load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elasticity: Volumes expand and contract fluidly with workload changes, eliminating waste from unused allocation. Cluster throughput scales linearly with demand as demand grows, with I/O distributed across DBS block servers. Each volume is sharded across many block servers, reducing hotspots and enabling parallel reads, writes, and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost and efficiency: Fluid Storage’s multi-tenant design keeps utilization high across large numbers of colocated volumes. Unmodified blocks are shared across database forks and read replicas, so new forks or replicas consume only the incremental changes they write. Because the platform continuously reclaims and reuses space, it doesn’t need to over-allocate or reserve idle capacity. Usage is billed based on actual consumption, not provisioned size, and the efficiency of this architecture translates directly into lower cost for users.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;40,038&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;494&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benchmark results from fio workloads on a Fluid Storage cluster running in a standard production environment on AWS. Reads and writes are generated from user space using direct I/O to bypass the local page cache, exercising the full I/O path described in “Life of a Request.” Latency and IOPS benchmarks use 4 KB blocks, while throughput (MB/s) benchmarks use 512 KB blocks to emulate client-side write coalescing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Performance: Latency remains low and stable across diverse client workloads, supported by asynchronous I/O and distributed sharding. Benchmarks from a standard Fluid Storage deployment in our production environment—run on production-scale client instances without IOPS rate limiting—demonstrate high and consistent performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As shown in the table above, a single Fluid Storage volume sustains read throughput exceeding 110,000 IOPS and 1.375 GB/s (with read throughput bottlenecked by network bandwidth in its current server configuration). It sustained write throughput between 40,000–67,000 IOPS and 500–700 MB/s. Single-block read latency is typically around 1 ms, and write latency around 5 ms. All writes are synchronously replicated in the DBS before returning to the client, ensuring durability without sacrificing stability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These capabilities change how developers and agents teams build, test, and evolve their systems. In continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, every pull request can run against its own isolated database fork, eliminating the need to queue behind shared test environments. Schema migrations can be rehearsed safely on full-fidelity clones before any production change, reducing rollout risk while preserving realistic data fidelity. Analytics teams can create short-lived copies of production data (without having to actually copy data or pay for it twice), explore results, and discard them when finished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same primitives that let developers iterate faster also unlock new possibilities for agentic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents can begin from a clean slate, spinning up an empty database for rapid prototyping, or start from a fork of production data to extend existing behavior or add new capabilities. Each agent operates on its own isolated fork, allowing parallel experiments and reasoning paths to run independently. Once experiments complete, results can be compared: a single branch promoted as the new primary, or code changes merged back into a production fork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this model, compute can become more ephemeral. Agents and workflows start instantly, run in isolation, and tear down when finished, leaving behind only snapshots that capture stable intermediate states. Snapshots become the natural unit of iteration, something to branch, backtrack, or extend as needed. Fluid Storage makes this loop—fork, test, recover, evolve—both fast and resource-efficient, turning operational data from a single artifact into a dynamic substrate for iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a world where workloads can self-orchestrate—spinning up, scaling, and shutting down autonomously—reliability must be continuous, not coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reliability and Resilience&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage is engineered for reliability through four independent layers of resilience—storage replication, database durability, compute recovery, and region-level isolation—each reinforcing the others to ensure consistent operation under failure. All of these mechanisms operate transparently; users never need to manage replicas, tune recovery, or coordinate failover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Storage replication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blocks comprising each volume in Fluid Storage are synchronously replicated across multiple block servers within a DBS cluster. The system automatically detects and compensates for replica failures, rebalancing data and restoring full replication without operator intervention. The storage proxy continuously monitors block-server health, routing around failed nodes to maintain continuity. At the client boundary, the storage device driver retries I/O through its current proxy when transient failures occur, and reconnects to a different proxy if the existing connection is lost. These processes are fully automatic, ensuring strong consistency and continuous availability within the storage tier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Database durability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond block-level replication, PostgreSQL durability is maintained through incremental backups and continuous WAL streaming. Each database retains enough WAL for arbitrary point-in-time recovery (PITR); even free services on Tiger Cloud provide 24-hour PITR. These backups and WAL segments are stored independently in S3, ensuring operational isolation from the active storage tier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the unlikely event of a Fluid Storage tier failure, new database volumes are automatically provisioned and restored from S3. The system also supports transparent migration between EBS-backed storage and Fluid Storage, allowing databases to move seamlessly across tiers if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Compute recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a compute instance fails (the node running PostgreSQL itself), Tiger Cloud automatically provisions a replacement, reattaches the existing Fluid Storage volume, restarts PostgreSQL, and triggers it to replay its latest WAL segments. Recovery typically completes within tens of seconds, even for single-instance databases without HA replicas. Because the storage proxy maintains no client-side state, reconnection and recovery are immediate once the new compute is available, all without user action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Region resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage supports both single- and multi-availability zone (AZ) deployments for a single DBS cluster. In multi-AZ configurations, sharded replica sets are distributed across zones to tolerate AZ-level failures. These modes represent a tradeoff: cross-AZ replication improves resilience but increases latency and inter-AZ network costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current deployments favor single-AZ clusters for lower latency and cost efficiency, while cross-AZ durability is achieved through PostgreSQL’s own high-availability replication. In this model, each database node in a multi-AZ cluster uses an independent Fluid Storage cluster in its respective zone. This design requires a full copy of storage per zone (at higher cost) but provides stronger fault isolation: each cluster operates with its own control plane, minimizing correlated failures across zones. This coordination is handled automatically by the system; the complexity is abstracted away from the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Availability and Access&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage already serves customer-facing workloads within Tiger Cloud and powers all databases in our new free tier. Developers can create, pause, resume, fork, and snapshot databases directly through the cloud console, REST API, Tiger CLI, or the Tiger MCP server, making it easy to experiment with elastic and fork-first behavior in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system is available today as a public beta for the free tier, with larger-scale workloads being onboarded gradually through early-access programs. General availability will follow sustained operation across a broad set of customer environments, ensuring that Fluid Storage meets the standards of maturity, reliability, and performance expected of a core database storage platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluid Storage introduces our next-generation storage architecture: a distributed block layer that combines synchronous replication, true elasticity, and zero-copy forks. It delivers predictable performance, efficient scaling up or down, and rapid recovery. It does this all while remaining fully compatible with PostgreSQL and, because it operates at the block storage layer, also remaining fully compatible with other databases and file systems as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every database in Tiger Cloud’s free tier now runs on Fluid Storage, giving developers direct access to these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This foundation opens new ways to build, test, and extend data-driven systems. From faster iteration in developer workflows to more autonomous, agentic applications, Fluid Storage makes data as dynamic as the systems built on it. Because if agents are the new developers, storage must evolve to match their speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try Fluid Storage today through Tiger’s free services: get started instantly with the Tiger CLI and MCP Server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you’re building an agentic or infrastructure platform and want to explore how Tiger’s databases powered by Fluid Storage can support your workloads, we’re opening early-access partnerships. Please get in touch to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;16:04 UTC on 29 October 2025 – Investigation commenced following monitoring alerts being triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;16:15 UTC on 29 October 2025 – We began the investigation and started to examine configuration changes within AFD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;16:18 UTC on 29 October 2025 – Initial communication posted to our public status page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;16:20 UTC on 29 October 2025 – Targeted communications to impacted customers sent to Azure Service Health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;17:26 UTC on 29 October 2025 – Azure portal failed away from Azure Front Door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;17:30 UTC on 29 October 2025 – We blocked all new customer configuration changes to prevent further impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;17:40 UTC on 29 October 2025 – We initiated the deployment of our ‘last known good’ configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;18:30 UTC on 29 October 2025 – We started to push the fixed configuration globally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;18:45 UTC on 29 October 2025 – Manual recovery of nodes commenced while gradual routing of traffic to healthy nodes began after the fixed configuration was pushed globally.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;00:05 UTC on 30 October 2025 – AFD impact confirmed mitigated for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not to put too fine a point on it, but if I have a dark passenger in my tech life it is almost entirely caused by what Microsoft wants to inflict on humanity - and more importantly; how successful they are at doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. But the point is compared to Azure in places the statement was very much the pot commenting on the kettles sooty arse. And git makes no particular pretence to be particularly friendly, just that it does a particular job efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feel like I have to defend windows phone here, I liked it! Although I swore off the platform after the hardware I bought wasn’t eligible for the windows phone 8 upgrade even though the hardware was less than two years old. They punished early adopters&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In Microsoft's defense, Azure has always been a complete joke. It's extremely developer unfriendly, buggy and overpriced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't forget extremely insecure. There is a quarterly critical cross-tenant CVE with trivial exploitation for them, and it has been like that for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've only used Azure, to me it seems fine ish. Some things are rather overcomplicated and it's far from perfect but I assumed the other providers were similarly complicated and imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can't say I've experienced many bugs in there either. It definitely is overpriced but I assume they all are?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,that is also typical. I've seen it take longer than that for AWS to update their status page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason is probably because changes to the status page require executive approval, because false positives could lead to bad publicity, and potentially having to reimburse customers for failing to meet SLAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our protection mechanisms, to validate and block any erroneous deployments, failed due to a software defect which allowed the deployment to bypass safety validations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very circular way of saying “the validator didn’t do its job”. This is AFAICT a pretty fundamental root cause of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s never good enough to have a validator check the content and hope that finds all the issues. Validators are great and can speed a lot of things up. But because they are independent code paths they will always miss something. For critical services you have to assume the validator will be wrong, and be prepared to contain the damage WHEN it is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. In addition. customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal. Customers can attempt to use programmatic methods (PowerShell, CLI, etc.) to access/utilize resources if they are unable to access the portal directly. We have failed the portal away from Azure Front Door (AFD) to attempt to mitigate the portal access issues and are continuing to assess the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are actively assessing failover options of internal services from our AFD infrastructure. Our investigation into the contributing factors and additional recovery workstreams continues. More information will be provided within 60 minutes or sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was last updated at 16:57 UTC on 29 October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: 16:35 UTC:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Azure Portal Access Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing DNS issues resulting in availability degradation of some services. Customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal. We have taken action that is expected to address the portal access issues here shortly. We are actively investigating the underlying issue and additional mitigation actions. More information will be provided within 60 minutes or sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was last updated at 16:35 UTC on 29 October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Azure Portal Access Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are investigating an issue with the Azure Portal where customers may be experiencing issues accessing the portal. More information will be provided shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was last updated at 16:18 UTC on 29 October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue. We are taking two concurrent actions where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services and at the same time rolling back to our last known good state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have failed the portal away from Azure Front Door (AFD) to mitigate the portal access issues. Customers should be able to access the Azure management portal directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do not have an ETA for when the rollback will be completed, but we will update this communication within 30 minutes or when we have an update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was last updated at 17:17 UTC on 29 October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We have initiated the deployment of our 'last known good' configuration. This is expected to be fully deployed in about 30 minutes from which point customers will start to see initial signs of recovery. Once this is completed, the next stage is to start to recover nodes while we route traffic through these healthy nodes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This message was last updated at 18:11 UTC on 29 October 2025"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this stage, we anticipate full mitigation within the next four hours as we continue to recover nodes. This means we expect recovery to happen by 23:20 UTC on 29 October 2025. We will provide another update on our progress within two hours, or sooner if warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was last updated at 19:57 UTC on 29 October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where do these alerts supposedly come from? I started having issues around 4PM (GMT), couldn't access portal, and couldn't make AKV requests from the CLI, and initially asked our Ops guys but with no info and a vague "There may be issues with Portal" on their status page, that was me done for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in many cases: no service health alerts, no status page updates and no confirmations from the support team in tickets. still we can confirm these issues from different customers accross europe. Mostly the issues are regional dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the single most frustrating thing about these incidents. As you're harmstrung on what you can do or how you can react until Microsoft officially acknowledges a problem. Took nearly 90mins both today and when it happened on 9th October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whilst the status message acknowledge's the issue with Front Door (AFD), it seems as though the rest of the actions are about how to get Portal/internal services working without relying on AFD. For those of us using Front Door does that mean we're in for a long haul?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's pretty unlikely. AWS published a public 'RCA' https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/. A race condition in a DNS 'record allocator' causing all DNS records for DDB to be wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm simplifying a bit, but I don't think it's likely that Azure has a similar race condition wiping out DNS records on _one_ system than then propagates to all others. The similarity might just end at "it was DNS".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That RCA was fun. A distributed system with members that don't know about each other, don't bother with leader elections, and basically all stomp all over each other updating the records. It "worked fine" until one of the members had slightly increased latency and everything cascade-failed down from there. I'm sure there was missing (internal) context but it did not sound like a well-architected system at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THIS is the real deal. Some say it's always DNS but many times it's some routing fuckup with BGP. two most cursed 3 letter acronym technologies out there&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I am guessing it's just a placeholder till they get more info. I thought I saw somewhere that internally within Microsoft it's seen as a "Sev 1" with "all hands on deck" - Annoyingly I can't remember where I saw it, so if someone spots it before I do, please credit that person :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a Sev 0 actually (as one would expect - this isn't a big secret). I was on the engineering bridge call earlier for a bit. The Azure service I work on was minimally impacted (our customer facing dashboard could not load, but APIs and data layer were not impacted) but we found a workaround.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;yea I saw that, but im not sure on how accurate that is. a few large apps/companies I know to be 100% on AWS in us-east-1 are cranking along just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already had to do it for large files served from Blob Storage since they would cap out at 2MB/s when not in cache of the nearest PoP. If you’ve ever experienced slow Windows Store or Xbox downloads it’s probably the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had a support ticket open for months about this and in the end the agent said “this is to be expected and we don’t plan on doing anything about it”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve moved to Cloudflare and not only is the performance great, but it costs less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only thing I need to move off Front Door is a static website for our docs served from Blob Storage, this incident will make us do it sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we are considering the same but because our website uses APEX domain we would need to move all DNS resolver to cloudfront right ? Does it have as a nice "rule set builder" as azure ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless you pay for CloudFlare’s Enterpise plan, you’re required to have them host your DNS zone, you can use a different registrar as long as you just point your NS records to Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be aware that if you’re using Azure as your registrar, it’s (probably still) impossible to change your NS records to point to CloudFlare’s DNS server, at least it was for me about 6 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also makes it impossible to transfer your domain to them either, as CloudFlare’s domain transfer flow requires you set your NS records to point to them before their interface shows a transfer option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our case we had to transfer to a different registrar, we used Namecheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, transferring a domain from Azure was also a nightmare. Their UI doesn’t have any kind of transfer option, I eventually found an obscure document (not on their Learn website) which had an az command which would let you get a transfer code which I could give to Namecheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I had to wait over a week for the transfer timeout to occur because there is no way on Azure side that I could find to accept the transfer immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found CloudFlare’s way of building rules quite easy to use, different from Front Door but I’m not doing anything more complex than some redirects and reverse proxying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will say that Cloudflare’s UI is super fast, with Front Door I always found it painfully slow when trying to do any kind of configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare also doesn’t have the problem that Front Door has where it requires a manual process every 6 months or so to renew the APEX certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks :). We don't use Azure as our registrar. It seems I'll have to plan for this then, we also had another issue, AFD has a hard 500ms tls handshake timeout (doesn't matter how much you put on the origin timeout settings) which means if our server was slow for some reason we would get 504 origin timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They briefly had a statement about using Traffic Manager to work with your AFD to work around this issue, with a link to learn.microsoft.com/...traffic-manager, and the link didn't work. Due to the same issue affecting everyone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They quickly updated the message to REMOVE the link. Comical at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed that Starbucks mobile ordering was down and thought “welp, I guess I’ll order a bagel and coffee on Grubhub”, then GrubHub was down. My next stop was HN to find the common denominator, and y’all did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen this up close twice and I’m surprised it’s only twice. Between March and September one year, 6 people on one team had to get new hard drives in their thinkpads and rebuild their systems. All from the same PO but doled out over the course of a project rampup. That was the first project where the onboarding docs were really really good, since we got a lot of practice in a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long before that, the first raid array anyone set up for my (teams’) usage, arrived from Sun with 2 dead drives out of 10. They RMA’d us 2 more drives and one of those was also DOA. That was a couple years after Sun stopped burning in hardware for cost savings, which maybe wasn’t that much of a savings all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many years ago (13?), I was around when Amazon moved SABLE from RAM to SSDs. A whole rack came from a single batch, and something like 128 disks went out at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was an intern but everyone seemed very stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Starbucks is not providing a critical service. Spending less money and resources and just accepting the risk that occasionally you won't be able to sell coffee for a few hours is a completely valid decision from both management and engineering pov.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's absolutely batshit that an in-person transaction with cash becomes impossible when the computers are down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've seen it multiple times at various stores; only once did I see them taking cash and writing things down (probably to enter into the system later when it came back up).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I were a Starbucks shareholder I wouldn't be happy that my company is throwing away revenue because of the CTO's decision to outsource accountability&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time and time again it's shown that AWS is far more expensive than other solutions, just easier for the Execs to offshore the blame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed it when my Netatmo rigamajig stopped notifying me of bad indoor air quality. Lovely. Why does it need to go through the cloud if the data is right there in the home network…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same here for netatmo - ironically I replied to an incident report with netatmo saying all was OK when the whole system was falling over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However netatmo does need to have a server to store data as you need to consolidate acreoss devices plus you can query gfor a year's data and that won't and can't be held locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My inner Nelson-from-the-Simpsons wishes I was on your team today, able to flaunt my flask of tea and homemade packed sandwiches. I would tease you by saying 'ha ha!' as your efforts to order coffee with IP packets failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I always go everywhere adequately prepared for beverages and food. Thanks to your comment, I have a new reason to do so. Take out coffees are actually far from guaranteed. Payment systems could go down, my bank account could be hacked or maybe the coffee shop could be randomly closed. Heck, I might even have an accident crossing the road. Anything could happen. Hence, my humble flask might not have the top beverage in it but at least it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all design systems with redundancy, backups and whatnot, but few of us apply this thinking to our food and drink. Maybe get a kettle for the office and a backup kettle, in case the first one fails?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It still surprises me how much essential services like public transport are completely reliant on cloud providers, and don't seem to have backups in place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here in The Netherlands, almost all trains were first delayed significantly, and then cancelled for a few hours because of this, which had real impact because today is also the day we got to vote for the next parlement (I know some who can't get home in time before the polls close, and they left for work before they opened).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is voting there a one day only event? If not, I feel the solution to that particular problem is quite clear. There’s a million things that could go wrong causing you to miss something when you try to do it in a narrow time range (today after work before polls close)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it’s a multi day event, it’s probably that way for a reason. Partially the same as the solution to above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In europe, voting typically happens in one day, where everyone physically goes to their designated voting place and puts papers in a transparent box. You can stay there and wait for the count at the end of the day if you want to. Tom Scott has a very good video about why we don't want electronic/mail voting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well "mail in voting" in Washington state pretty much means you drop off your ballot in a drop box in your neighborhood. Which is pretty much the same thing as putting it in a ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The description of voting in the Netherlands is that you can see your ballot physically go into a clear box and stay to see that exact box be opened and all ballots tallied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dropping a ballot in a box in tour neighborhood helps ensure nothing with regards to the actually ballot count.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here in NZ when I've been to vote, there are usually a couple of party affiliates at the voting location, doing what one of the parent posts described:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You can stay there and wait for the count at the end of the day if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you watch the election night news, you'll see footage of multiple people counting the votes from the ballot boxes, again with various people observing to check that nothing dodgy is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having everyone just put their ballots in a postbox seems like a good way remove public trust from the electoral system, because noone's standing around waiting for the postie to collect the mail, or looking at what happens in the mail truck, or the rest of the mail distribution process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sure I've seen reports in the US of people burning postboxes around election time. Things like this give more excuses to treat election results as illegitimate, which I believe has been an issue over there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Yes, we do also have advanced voting in NZ, but I think they're considered "special votes" and are counted separately .. the elections are largely determined on the day by in-person votes, with the special votes being confirmed some days later)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Sweden, mail/early votes get sent through the postal system to the official ballot box for those votes. In 2018, a local election had to be redone because the post delivered votes late. Mail delivery occasionally have packaged delayed or lost, and votes are note immune to this problem. In one case the post also gave the votes to an unauthorized person, through the votes did end up at the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a small but distinct difference between mail/early voting and putting the votes directly into the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what’s so special in Oregon’s ballot boxes. But, tampering that is detected (don’t need much special to detect a burning box I guess!) is not a complete failure for a system. If any elections were close enough for a box to matter, they could have rerun them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With proper mail voting you have a way to verify that your mailed in vote is counted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(AI generated explanation) How the double-envelope system works&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inner “secrecy” envelope&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You mark your ballot, fold it, and slip it into an unmarked inner envelope. No name or identifying info is on this envelope, so your choices stay anonymous. Outer declaration envelope&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inner envelope goes inside a larger outer envelope that carries: – A ballot ID/barcode unique to you. – A signature line that must match the one on file with your election office. In many states, a detachable privacy flap or perforated strip hides the signature until election officials open the outer envelope, keeping the ballot secret.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you wish, you can write a phrase on your ballot. The phrases and their corresponding vote are broadcast (on tv, internet, etc). So if you want to validate that your vote was tallied correctly, write a unique phrase. Or you could pick a random 30 digit number, collisions should be zero-probability, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, this would be annoying because people would write slurs and advertisements, and the government would have to broadcast them. But, it seems pretty robust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d suggest the state handle the number issuing, but then they could record who they issues which numbers to, and the winning party could go about rounding up their opposition, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Googling around a bit, it sounds like there are systems that let you verify that your ballot made it, but not necessarily that it was counted correctly. (For this reason, I guess?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to trust that whole system. Maybe you do, I don't know the details of how any of that works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I vote in person, I know all the officials there from various parties are just like...looking at the box for the whole day to make sure everything is counted. It's much easier to understand and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, I can't think of an EU country that does not have some form of advance voting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here in Latvia the "election day" is usually (always?) on weekend, but the polling stations are open for some (and different!) part of every weekday leading up. Something like couple hours on monday morning, couple hours on tuesday evening, couple around midday wednesday, etc. In my opinion, it's a great system. You have to have a pretty convoluted schedule for at least one window not to line up for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think they meant "don't have it" as in except in special circumstances, and that form says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You may use this form to apply for a postal vote if, due to the circumstances of your work/service or your full-time study in the State, you cannot go to your polling station on polling day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which seems to indicate that's only for people who can't go to the polling station, otherwise you do have to go there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that a lot of Ireland's voting practices come from having a small population but a huge diaspora. I imagine the percentage of people living outside Ireland what would be eligible to vote in many other countries is significant enough to effect elections, certainly if they are close.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone who spent the first 30 years of my life in Ireland but is now part of that diaspora, it's frustrating but I get it. I don't get to vote, but neither do thousands of plastic paddys who have very little genuine connection to Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I'm sure they could expand the voting window to a couple of days at least without too much issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Italy has mail-in vote only for citizen residing abroad. The rest vote on the election Sunday (and Monday morning in some cases, at least in the past).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't have to attribute any name to the transaction, just a voting booth ID and the vote. The actual benefit is just that it is hard to tamper and easy to trace where tampering happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I still prefer the paper vote and I usually a blockchain apathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anonymous voting means that you can't sell your vote. Like, if I pay you $5 to vote for X, but I can't actually verify that you voted for X and not Y, then I wouldn't bother trying. Or if I'm your boss and I want you to vote for X... etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Washington State having full vote-by-mail (there is technically a layer of in-person voting as a fallback for those who need it for accessibility reasons or who missed the registration deadline) has spoiled me rotten, I couldn't imagine having to go back to synchronous on-site voting on a single day like I did in Illinois. Awful. Being able to fill my ballot at my leisure, at home, where I can have all the research material open, and drive it to a ballot drop box whenever is convenient in a 2-3 week window before 20:00 on election night, is a game-changer for democracy. Of course this also means that people who serve to benefit from disenfranchising voters and making it more difficult to vote, absolutely hate our system and continually attack it for one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a Dutchman, I have to go vote in person on a specific day. But to be honest: I really don't mind doing so. If you live in a town or city, there'll usually be multiple voting locations you can choose from within 10 minutes walking distance. I've never experienced waiting times more than a couple of minutes. Opening times are pretty good, from 7:30 til 21:00. The people there are friendly. What's not to like? (Except for some of the candidates maybe, but that's a whole different story. :-))&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're on year five of one of the two parties telling voters to not trust early voting. Their choice is because of the Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt created by the propaganda they are fed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"No mail-in or 'Early' Voting, Yes to Voter ID! Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is! Millions of Ballots being 'shipped.' GET SMART REPUBLICANS, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's all happening too, but it's honestly a different topic altogether. We have the ability to vote early. Whether you trust it or politicians are trying to undermine your trust in it, etc.... whole other can of worms&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please lookup US voting poll overflow issues that come up every election cycle. Just because you experience a well streamlined process doesn't mean that it's the norm everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, if you have a minor emergency, like a kidney stone and hospitalized for the day - you just miss your chance to vote in that election?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If so, I see a lot to dislike. As the point I was making is you can’t anticipate what might come up. Just because it’s worked thus far doesn’t mean it’s designed for resilience. There’s a lot of ways you could miss out in that type of situation. I seems silly to make sure everything else is redundant and fault tolerant in the name of democracy when the democratic process itself isn’t doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is that an acceptable response? Honestly. You’re in the hospital, in pain, likely having a minor surgery, and having someone cast your vote for you is going to be on your mind too? Do you have your voting card in your pocket just in case this were to play out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s just ridiculous in my opinion. Makes me wonder how many well intentioned would be voters end up missing out each election cause shit happens and voting is pretty optional&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mild curiosity, no idea whether it would be statistically relevant but asking the question is the first step. If you knew the answer, you might want to extend the voting window even if it wouldn't effect an elections outcome it would be a quantified number of people excluded from the democratic process for simply having bad luck at the wrong time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If India can have voters vote and tally all the votes in one day, then so can everyone else. It’s the best way to avoid fraud and people going with whoever is ahead. I am sympathetic with emergency protocols for deadly pandemics, but for all else, in-person on a given day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; If India can have voters vote and tally all the votes in one day, then so can everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most countries, in the elections you vote or the member of parliament you want. Presidential elections, and city council elections are held separately, but are also equally simple. But in one election you cast your vote for one person, and that's it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this kind of elections, many countries manage to hold the elections on paper ballots, count them all by hand, and publish results by midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But on an American ballot, you vote for, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- US president - US senator - US member of congress - state governor - state senator - state member of congress - several votes for several different state judge positions - several other state officer positions - several votes for several local county officers - local sheriff - local school board member - several yes/no votes for several proposed laws, whether they should be passed or not&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think it would be possible to calculate all these 20 or 40 votes, if calculated by hand. That's why they use voting machines in America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say, how many voting stations are there in a typical city/county in the US?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here in Indonesia, in a city of 2 million people there are over 7000 voting stations. While we vote for 5 ballots (President, Legislative (National, Province, and City/Regency), we still use paper ballots and count them by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is it not possible? It's just additional votes, there isn't anything actually stopping counting by hand, is there? How was it counted historically without voting machines?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it's not a national holiday where the vast majority of people don't have to work, and if there aren't polling places reasonably near every voting age citizen, it's voter suppression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular India has a law that no one shall be made to walk more than 2km to vote. The Indian military will literally deploy a voting booth into the jungle so that a single caretaker of an old temple can vote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finance is increasingly reliant on it too, my bank moved their entire system to AWS. The amount of power being handed over to these cloud companies in exchange for “convenience” is astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here in Belgium voting is usually done during the weekend, although it shouldn't matter because voting is a civic duty (unless you have a good reason you have to go vote or you'll be fined), so those who work during the weekend have a valid reason to come in late or leave early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the US, where I assume a lot of the griping comes from, election day is not a national holiday, nor is it on a weekend (in fact, by law it is defined as "the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November"), and even though it is acknowledged as an important civic duty, only about half of the states have laws on the books that require employers provide time off to vote. There are no federal laws to that effect, so it's left entirely to states to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Australia there are so many places to vote, it is almost popping out to get milk level if convenience. Just detour your dog walk slightly. Always at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Australia there are so many places to vote, it is almost popping out to get milk level if convenience. (At least in urbia and suburbia) Just detour your dog walk slightly. Always at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the US getting milk involves driving multiple miles, finding parking, walking to the store, finding a shopping cart, finding the grocery department, navigating the aisles to the dairy section, finding the milk, waiting in line to check out, returning the cart if you’re courteous, and driving back. Could take an hour or so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In washington we have a 100% mail-in voting system (for all intents and purposes). I can put my ballot back in the mail or drop at any number of drop-boxes throughout the city (less dropboxes in rural areas i'm sure). I think there are some allowances for in-person voting but I don't think they are often used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a ballot tracking system as well, I can see and be notified as my ballot moves through the counting system. It's pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually just got back from dropping off my local elections ballot 15m ago, quick bike trip maybe a mile or so away and back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, because it makes it easy for people to vote, the republicans want to do away with it. If you have to stand in line for several hours (which seems to be very normal in most cities) and potentially miss work to do it that's going to all but guarantee that working people and the less motivated will not vote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes in places that only do in person voting, national or state holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the article isn't complete: while the travel planner and ticket machines were the first to fail, trains were cancelled soon after; it took a few hours before everything restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on what the conductors said, I would speculate that the train drivers digital schedule was not operative, so they didn't know where to go next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't find a detailed statistic on the overall delays, but the per-station statistics for Amsterdam Centraal say 5% of trains were cancelled and 17% were delayed by 5 minutes or more (mostly by 10 minutes): https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/train-archive/2025-10-29/a...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i'm not sure this is an easily solvable problem. i remember reading an article arguing that your cloud provider is part of your tech stack and it's close to impossible/a huge PITA to make a non-trivial service provider-agnostic. they'd have to run their own openstack in different datacenters, which would be costly and have their own points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run non trivial services on EC2, using that service as a VPS. My deploy script works just as well on provisioned Digital Ocean services and on docker containers using docker-compose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do need a human to provision a few servers and configure e.g. load balancing and when to spin up additional servers under load. But that is far less of a PITA than having my systems tied to a specific provider or down whenever a cloud precipitates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moment you choose to use S3 instead of hosting your own object store, though, you either use AWS because S3 and IAM already have you or spend more time on the care and feeding of your storage system as opposed to actually doing the thing you customers are paying you to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not impossible, just complicated and difficult for any moderately complex architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations who had their own datacenters were chided for being resistant to modernizing, and now they modernized to use someone else's shared computers and they stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really do feel the only viable future for clouds is hybrid or agnostic clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Flemish bus company (de Lijn) uses Azure and I couldn't activate my ticket when I came home after training a couple of hours ago. I should probably start using physical tickets again, because at least those work properly. It's just stupid that there's so much stuff being moved to digital only (often even only being accessible through an Android or iOS app, despite the parent companies of those two being utterly atrocious) when the physical alternatives are more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet... deploy on two clouds and you'll get tax payers scream at you for "wasting money" preparing for a black swan event. Can't have both, either reliability or lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dang even zealand didn't survive! new zealand got some soul searching with this outage which took down government person ID service, it's called RealME and it can be used to file your taxes apply for passport etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;can't believe it's 2025 and some still need to go to some place to vote. I can vote since I can remember(at least 20 years) by mail for anything, we also vote multiple times a year(4-6 times), we just get 1 Month before the things to vote by mail and then mail in back votes. Hope we can soon vote online to get rid of the paper overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally I am thinking more and more about hetzner, yes I know its not an apples to orange comparison. But its honestly so good&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone had created a video where they showed the underlying hardware etc., I am wondering if there is something like https://vpspricetracker.com/ but with geek-benchmarks as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This video was affiliated with scalahosting but still I don't think that there was too much bias of them and they showed at around 3:37 a graph comparison with prices https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dvuBH2Pc1g&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it shows how contabo has better hardware but I am pretty sure that there might be some other issues, and honestly I feel a sense of trust with hetzner I am not sure about others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either hetzner or self hosting stuff personally or just having a very cheap vps and going to hetzner if need be but hetzner already is pretty cheap or I might use some free service that I know of are good as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably not, but at least you don’t delude yourself into thinking reliability is a solved problem just because you’re paying through the nose for compute and storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of recent (4 months ago) Cloudflare outages (I think it was even workers) was caused by Google Cloud being down and Cloudflare hosting an essential service there&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hm it seemed that they hosted a critical service for cloudflare kv on google itself, but I wonder about the update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally I just trust cloudflare more than google, given how their focus is on security whereas google feels googly...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have heard some good things about google cloud run and the google's interface feels the best out of AWS,Azure,GCloud but I still would just prefer cloudflare/hetzner iirc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another question: Has there ever been a list of all major cloud outages, like I am interested how many times google cloud and all cloud providers went majorly down I guess y'know? is there a website/git project that tracks this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason an Azure outage does not faze me in the same way that an AWS outage does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have never had much confidence in Azure as a cloud provider. The vertical integration of all the things for a Microsoft shop was initially very compelling. I was ready to fight that battle. But, this fantasy was quickly ruined by poor execution on Microsoft's part. They were able to convince me to move back to AWS by simply making it difficult to provision compute resources. Their quota system &amp;amp; availability issues are a nightmare to deal with compared to EC2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I'd rather use GCP over Azure and I have zero seconds of experience with it. The number of things Microsoft gets right in 2025 can be counted single-handedly. The things they do get right are quite good, but everything else tends to be extremely awful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "Blades" experience [0] where instead of navigating between pages it just kept opening things to the side and expanding horizontally?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, that had some fun ideas but was way more confusing than it needed to be. But also that was quite a few years back now. The Portal ditched that experience relatively quickly. Just long enough to leave a lot of awful first impressions, but not long enough for it to be much more than a distant memory at this point, several redesigns later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[0] The name "Blades" for that came from the early years of the Xbox 360, maybe not the best UX to emulate for a complex control panel/portal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Azure to me has always suffered from a belief that “UI innovations can solve UX complexity if you just try hard enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like, AWS, and GCP to a lesser extent, has a principled approach where simple click-ops goals are simple. You can access the richer metadata/IAM object model at any time, but the wizards you see are dumb enough to make easy things easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Azure, those blades allow tremendously complex “you need to build an X Container and a Container Bucket to be able to add an X” flows to coexist on the same page. While this exposes the true complexity, and looks cool/works well for power users, it is exceedingly unintuitive. Inline documentation doesn’t solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sometimes wonder if this is by design: like QuickBooks, there’s an entire economy of consultants who need to be Certified and thus will promote your product for their own benefit! Making the interface friendly to them and daunting to mere mortals is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in Azure’s case it’s hard to tell how much this is intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still feel lost just trying to view my application logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't want to pay for or lock myself into, "Azure Insights".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just want to see the logging, that I know if I can remember the right buttons to click, are available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The worst place to try is "Monitoring &amp;gt; Logs", this is where you get faced up front with a query designer. I've never worked out how to do a simple "list by time" on that query designer, but it doesn't matter, because if you suffer through that UX, you find out that's not actually where the logs are anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to go down a different path. Don't be distracted by "Log Stream", that's not it either, it sounds useful but it's not. By default it doesn't log anything. If you do configure it to log, then it still doesn't actually log everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you have to actually do, and I've had to open the portal to check this, is click "Diagnose and Solve Problems" and then look for "Diagnostic tools" and then a small link to "Application Event Logs".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally you get to your logs, although it's still a bad way to try to view logs, it's at least marginally better than the real windows event viewer, an application that feels like it hasn't been updated since NT4. ( Although some might suggest that's a good thing. )&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of Azure Insights is a value add on top of OTel. You can use "just" OTel feeding Azure Insights (and that's what the modern Aspire-influenced defaults mostly do) and possibly avoid that feeling of vendor lockin. That perspective might also give you ideas of other "modern" vendors to audition such as Grafana if you wanted to see what other people are doing with OTel rather than Event Logs and file system logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I think that's from near the transition because it has full "windowing" controls of minimize/maximize/close buttons. I recall a period with only close buttons.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that blue space you could keep filling with more "blades" as you clicked on things until the entire page started scrolling horizontally to switch between "blades". Almost everything you could click opened in a new blade rather than in place in the existing blade. (Like having "Open in New Window" as your browser default.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was trying to merge the needs of a configurable Dashboard and a "multi-window experience". You could save collections of blades (a bit like Niri workspaces) as named Dashboards. Overall it was somewhere between overkill and underthought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Also someone reminded me that many "blades" still somewhat exist in the modern Portal, because, of course, Microsoft backwards compatibility. Some of the pages are just "maximized Blades" and you can accidentally unmaximize them and start horizontally scrolling into new blades.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;azure likes to open new sections on the same tab / page as opposed to reloading or opening a new page / tab (overlays? modals? I'm lost on graphic terms)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;depending on the resource you're accessing, you can get 5+ sections each with their own ui/ux on the same page/tab and it can be confusing to understand where you're at in your resources&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you're having trouble visualizing it, imagine an url where each new level is a different application with its own ui/ux and purpose all on the same webpage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS' UI is similarly messy, and to this day. They regularly remove useful data from the UI, or change stuff like the default sort order of database snapshots from last created to initial instance created date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never understood why a clear and consistent UI and improved UX isn't more of a priority for the big three cloud providers. Even though you talk mostly via platform SDK's, I would consider better UI especially initially, a good way to bind new customers and pick your platform over others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess with their bottom line they don't need it (or cynically, you don't want to learn and invest in another cloud if you did it once).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s more than just the UI itself (which is horrible), it’s the whole thing that is very hostile to new users even if they’re experienced. It’s such an incoherent mess. The UI, the product names, the entire product line itself, with seemingly overlapping or competing products… and now it’s AI this and AI that. If you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for, good luck finding it. It’s like they’re deliberately trying to make things as confusing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason this applies to all AWS, GCP and Azure. Seems like the result of dozens of acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still find it much easier to just self host than learn cloud and I’ve tried a few times but it just seems overly complex for the sake of complexity. It seems they tie in all their services to jack up charges, eg. I came for S3 but now I’m paying for 5 other things just to get it working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any time something is that unintuitive to get started, I automatically assume that if I encounter a problem that I’ll be unable to solve it. That thought alone leads me to bounce every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;100% agree. I've been working in the industry for almost 20 years, I'm a full stack developer and I manage my servers. I've tried signing up for AWS and I noped out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS Is a complete mess. Everything is obscured behind other products, and they're all named in the most confusing way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GCP console is not the best but as a long term multicloud user, I can assure you that GCP is much better than Azure portal and/or Azure APIs which is fucking hell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know for some people the prospect of losing their Google Cloud access due to an automated terms of service violation on some completely unrelated service is worrisome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd hope you can create a Google Cloud account under a completely different email address, but I do as little business with Google as I can get away with, so I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's generally speaking a good practice anyways. My Amazon shopping account has a different email than my Amazon Web Services account. I intuited that they need to be different from the get go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloud Run is incredible. It’s one of those things I wish more devs knew about. Even at work where we use GCP all the “smart” devs insist on GKE for their “webscale” services that get dozens of requests a second. Dozens!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that in some industries, Microsoft is the only option. Many of these regulated industries are just now transitioning from the data center to the cloud, and they've barely managed to get approval for that with all of the Microsoft history in their organization. AWS or GCloud are complete non-starters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I moved a 100% MS shop to AWS circa 2015. We ran our DCs on EC2 instances just as if they were on prem. At some point we installed the AAD connector and bridged some stuff to Azure for office/mail/etc., but it was all effectively in AWS. We were selling software to banks so we had a lot of due diligence to suffer. AWS Artifact did much of the heavy lifting for us. We started with Amazon's compliance documentation and provided our own feedback on top where needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like compliance is the entire point of using these cloud providers. You get a huge head start. Maintaining something like PCI-DSS when you own the real estate is a much bigger headache than if it's hosted in a provider who is already compliant up through the physical/hardware/networking layers. Getting application-layer checkboxes ticked off is trivial compared to "oops we forgot to hire an armed security team". I just took a look and there are currently 316 certifications and attestations listed under my account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've found that lift and shifting to EC2 is also generally cheaper than the equivalent VMs on Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft really wants you to use their PaaS offerings, and so things on Azure are priced accordingly. A Microsoft shop just wanting to lift-and-shift, Azure isn't the best choice unless the org has that "nobody ever got fired for buying Microsoft" attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is better at regulatory capture, so Azure has many customers in the public sector. So an Azure outage probably affects the public sector more (see example above about trains).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has the regulatory capture. All the European privacy and regulatory laws are good for Azure. That's why your average European government or baking app runs most likely on Azure. (or Oracle, but more likely Azure)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Amazon, Azure, and Google are showing with their platform crashes amid layoffs, while they supports governments that are Oppressing's Citizens and Ignoring the Law, is that they do not care about anything other than the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They think they have the market captured, but I think what their dwindling quality and ethics are really going to drive is adoption of self hosting, distributed computing frameworks. Nerds are the ones who drove adoption of these platforms, and we can eventually end if we put in the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seriously with container technology, and a bit more work / adoption on distributed compute systems and file storage (IPFS,FileCoin) there is a future where we dont have to use big brothers compute platform. Fuck these guys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These were my thoughts exactly. I may have my tinfoil hat on, but outages these close together between the largest cloud providers amid social unrest, my wonder is the government / tech companies implementing some update that adds additional spyware / blackout functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really hope this pushes the internet back to how it used to be, self hosted, privacy, anonymity. I truly hope that's where we're headed, but the masses seem to just want to stay comfortable as long as their show is on TV&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All I'm saying Its a complete 360 from the marketing they did to establish their brand... you know, save the world kind of stuff, especially from google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From 2000-2016 most tech marketing\branding was aimed at some kind of social benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least some bits of it do. I was writing something to pull logs the other day and the redirect was to an azure bucket. It also returned a 401 with the valid temporary authed redirect in the header. I was a bit worried I'd found a massive security hole but it appears after some testing it just returned the wrong status code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IIRC, the grocery chain I worked for used to have an offline mode to move customers out the door. But it meant that when the system came back online, if the customers card was denied, the customer got free groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yea, good old store and forward. We implemented it in our PoS system. Now, we do non PCI integrations so we arn't in PCI scope, but depending on the processor, it can come with some limitations. Like, you can do store and forward, but only up to X number of transactions. I think for one integration, it's 500-ish store wide (it uses a local gateway that store and forwards to the processors gateway). The other integration we have, its 250, but store and forward on device, per device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many places it's also possibly just a left over feature from older times. I worked at a major UK supermarket in the mid-00s, and their checkout system had this feature. But it was like that because that's how it was originally built, it wasn't a 'feature' they added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Credit card information would be recorded by the POS, synced to a mini-server in the back office (using store-and-forward to handle network issues) and then in a batch process overnight, sent to HQ where the payment was processed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn't until chip-and-PIN was rolled out that they started supporting "online" (i.e. processed then and there) card transactions, and even then the old method still worked if there was a network issues or power failure (all POSes has their own UPS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only real risk at the time was that someone tried to pay with a cancelled credit card - the bank would always honour the payment otherwise. But that was pretty uncommon back then, as you'd have to phone your bank to do it, not just press a button in an app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IIRC, the grocery chain I worked for used to have an offline mode to move customers out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chick-fil-a has this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the tech people there was on HN a few years ago describing their system. Credit card approval slows down the line, so the cards are automatically "approved" at the terminal, and the transaction is added to a queue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The loss from fraudulent transactions turns out to be less than the loss from customers choosing another restaurant because of the speed of the lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The POS I work on also has this feature. Line busters take the order and payment but we have a toggle where you can immediately “approve” and queue it up. If the payment fails then the person handing you your food will see it on the order and ask you for alternative payment. It helps prevent loss and speeds up the line overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was shopping at a mall with a visa vanilla card once. I got it as a gift and didn't know the limit. No matter what I bought the card kept going -- and I never got a balance of what was on the card. Eventually, later that day it stopped. I called customer support and asked how much was left on the balance. They told me they had no idea my balance - but everything I bought was mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember that banks will try to honor the transactions, even if the customer's balance/credit limit is exhausted. It doesn't apply only to some gift cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a Family Dollar by my house that is down at least 2 full days per month because of bad inet connectivity. I live close enough that with a small tower on my roof i can get line of sight to theirs. I've thought about offering them a backup link off my home inet if they give me 50% of sales whenever its in use. It would be a pretty good deal for them, better some sales when their inet is down vs none.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's Family Dollar, margin has to be almost nothing and sales per day is probably &amp;lt; $1k. That's why I said 50% of sales and not profit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I go there daily because it's a nice 30min round trip walk and I wfh. I go up there to get a diet coke or something else just to get out of the house. It amazes me when i see a handwritten sign on the door "closed, system is down". I've gotten to know the cashiers so I asked and it's because the internet connection goes down all the time. That store has to one of the most poorly run things i've ever seen yet it stays in business somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the point people are trying and failing to make is that asking for half of means sales is half of revenue not half of net and that you’re out of your goddamned mind if you think a store with razor thin margins would sell at a massive loss rather than just close due to connectivity problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your responses imply that you think people are questioning whether you would lose money on the deal while we are instead saying you’ll get laughed out of the store, or possibly asked never to come back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately they are largely corporate, which is how they can sell items for such a cheap price. The store manager probably has zero say in nearly anything. Even if they wanted to "break the rules," I doubt they could make use of your connection as a backup, but I've also worked for smaller companies that were able to sell internet access to individual locations like Denny's and various large hotels in the US. Being able to somehow share sales would be the difficult part, since all sales are reported back to corporate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good luck if you make this work for you, it would be exciting to hear about if you're able to get them to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2-3%, bit higher on perishables. Though i'd just ask lump sum payments in cash since it likely has to no go through corporate (as in, avoid the corporation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'd think any SeriousBusiness would have a backup way to take customers' money. This is the one thing you always want to be able to do: accept payment. If they made it so they can't do that, they deserve the hit to their revenue. People should just walk out of the store with the goods if they're not being charged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why doesn't someone in the store at least have one of those manual kachunk-kachunk carbon copy card readers in the back that they can resuscitate for a few days until the technology is turned back on? Did they throw them all away?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kachunk-kachunk credit card machines need raised digits on the cards, and I don't think most banks have been issuing those for years at this point. Mine have been smooth for at least 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My card tied to my main financial institution have the raised digits, but most cards you'd sign up for online now no longer have the raised digits (and often allow you to select art to appear on the card face).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a lot of payment terminals have an option to record transactions offline and upload them later, but apparently it's not enabled by default - probably because it increases your risk that someone pays with a bad card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they used standalone merchant terminals, then those typically use the local LAN which can rollover to cellular or PoT in the event of a network outage. The store can process a card transaction with the merchant terminal and then reconcile with the end of day chit. This article from 2008 describes their PoS https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/store-operations/ca...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These stores appear everywhere, even in areas with high income. You'd be surprised, but often people with those high incomes shop for certain products at very low rates, and that's how they keep their savings. A good example is garbage bags. Most people don't care too much about the quality of their garbage bags, unless they rip on the way to the bin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Germany many stores still accept cash and some even only accept cash and we are ridiculed for this... Seems like one of the rare instances where this is useful :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's sad the number of stores I've seen where they just shut down when they can't use the checkout machines; the clerks aren't allowed to do math even if they could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whereas the smaller, owner-run stores have more leeway; the local tiny grocery "sold" all freezer/refrigerator food for cheap/free during a power failure. The big Walmart closed and threw everything away the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just to add - this particular supermarket wasn’t fully down, it took ages for them to press “sub total” and then pick the payment method. I suspect it was slow waiting for a request to timeout perhaps&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember last mechanical cash registers in my country in 90s and when these got replaced by early electronic ones with blue vacuum fluorescent tubes. Then everything got smaller and smaller. Now I'm pestered to "add the item to the cart" by software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week I couldn't pay for flowers for grandma's grave because smartphone-sized card terminal refused to work - it stuck on charging-booting loop so I had to get cash. Tho my partner thinks she actually wanted to get cash without a receipt for herself excluding taxes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most retailers trust their cashiers a bit less than they trust the customers. They'd rather shut down during a power/Internet failure than give any autonomy to the worker drones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can, but it's all about risk mitigation. Most processors have some form of store and forward (and it can have limitations like only X number of transactions). Some even have controls to limit the amount you can store-and-forward (for instance, only charges under $50). But ultimately, it's still risk mitigation. You can store-and-forward, but you're trusting that the card/account has the funds. If it doesn't, you loose and ain't shit you can do about it. If you can't tolerate any risk, you don't turn on store and forward systems and then you can't process cards offline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its not the we are not capable. Its, is the business willing to assume the risk?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently standing in a half closed supermarket because the tills are down and they cant take payments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a fairly large supermarket near me that has both kinds of outages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Occasionally it can't take cards because the (fiber? cable?) internet is down, so it's cash only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Occasionally it can't take cash because the safe has its own cellular connection, and the cell tower is down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was at Frank's Pizza in downtown Houston a few weeks ago and they were giving slices of pizza away because the POS terminal died, and nobody knew enough math to take cash. I tried to give them a $10 and told them to keep the change, but "keep the change" is an unknown phrase these days. They simply couldn't wrap their brains around it. But hey, free pizza!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are very dependent on Azure and Microsoft Authentication and Microsoft 365 and haven’t had weekly or even monthly issues. I can think of maybe three issues this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been migrating our services off of Azure slowly for the past couple of years. The last internet facing things remaining are a static assets bucket and an analytics VM running Matomo. Working with Front Door has been an abysmal experience, and today was the push I needed to finally migrate our assets to Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel pretty justified in my previous decisions to move away from Azure. Using it feels like building on quicksand…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have had intermittent issues with winget today. I use UniGetUI for a front-end, and anything tied to Microsoft has failed for me. Judging by the logs, it's mostly retrieving the listing of versions (I assume similar to what 'apt-get update' does, I'm fairly new to using winget for Windows package management).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re 100% on Azure but so far there’s no impact for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luckily, we moved off Azure Front Door about a year ago. We’d had three major incidents tied to Front Door and stopped treating it as a reliable CDN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They weren’t global outages, more like issues triggered by new deployments. In one case, our homepage suddenly showed a huge Microsoft banner about a “post-quantum encryption algorithm” or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kinda wild that a company that big can be so shaky on a CDN, which should be rock solid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We battled https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1331370/... for over a year, and finally decided to move off since there was no any resolution. Unfortunately our API servers were still behind AFD so they were affected by today's stuff...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty much every single Microsoft domain I've tried to access loads for a looooong time before giving me some bare html. I wonder if someone can explain why that's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve been experimenting with multi-cluster failover for Kubernetes workloads, and one open-source project that actually works really well is k8gb .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It acts as a GSLB controller inside Kubernetes — doing DNS-level health checks, region awareness, and automatic failover between clusters when one goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It integrates with ExternalDNS and supports multiple DNS providers (Infoblox, Route53, Azure DNS, NS1, etc.), so it can handle failover across both on-prem and cloud clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not a silver bullet for every architecture, but it’s one of the few OSS projects that make multi-region failover actually manageable in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And querying https://www.microsoft.com/ results in HTTP 200 on the root document, but the page elements return errors (a 504 on the .css/.js documents, a 404 on some fonts, Name Not Resolved on scripts.clarity.ms, Connection Timed Out on wcpstatic.microsoft.com and mem.gfx.ms). That many different kinds of errors is actually kind of impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm gonna say this was a networking/routing issue. The CDN stayed up, but everything else non-CDN became unroutable, and different requests traveled through different paths/services, but each eventually hit the bad network path, and that's what created all the different responses. Could also have been a bad deploy or a service stopped running and there's different things trying to access that service in different ways, leading to the weird responses... but that wouldn't explain the failed DNS propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been doing it since 1998 in my bedroom with a dual T1 (and on to real DCs later). While I've had some outages for sure it makes me feel better I am not that divergent in uptime in the long run vs big clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They added a message at the same time as your comment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We are investigating an issue with the Azure Portal where customers may be experiencing issues accessing the portal. More information will be provided shortly."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah just took down the prod site for one of our clients since we host the front-end out of their CDN. Just got wrapped up panic hosting it somewhere else for the past hour, very quickly reminds you about the pain of cookies...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all need to move away from these big cloud providers. Two medium size smaller providers is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Cloudflare for R2 (object storage) and CDN (Fastly+backblaze also available). -Two VPS/Server providers with a decent reputation and mid-size (using a comparison site like https://serversearcher.com or look directly into people like Hetzner or latitude) -PlanetScale or Neon for database if you don't co-locate it, though better to use someone like digital ocean, vultr or latitude who offer databases too)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; We all need to move away from these big cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then who do we blame when things are down? If we manage our own infrastructure we have to stay late to fix it when it breaks instead of saying “sorry, Microsoft, nothing we can do” and magically our clients accepting that…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty much all Azure services seem to be down. Their status page says it's only the portal since 16:00. It would be nice if these mega-companies could update their status page when they take down a large fraction of the Internet and thousands of services that use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same playbook for AWS. When they admitted that Dynamo was inaccessible, they failed to provide context that their internal services are heavily dependent on Dynamo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's only after the fact they are transparent about the impact&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Internet is supposed to be decentralized. The big three seem to have all the power now (Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) plus Cloudflare/Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did we get here? Is it because of scale? Going to market in minutes by using someone else's computers instead of building out your own, like co-location or dedicated servers, like back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of money and years of marketing the cloud as the responsible business decision led us here. Now that the cloud providers have vendor lock-in, few will leave, and customers will continue to wildly overpay for cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not sure how the current situation is better. Being stranded with no way whatsoever to access most/all of your services sounds way more terrifying than regular issues limited to a couple of services at a time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; no way whatsoever to access most/all of your services&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I work on a product hosted on Azure. That's not the case. Except for front door, everything else is running fine. (Front door is a reverse proxy for static web sites.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The product itself (an iot stormwater management system) is running, but our customers just can't access the website. If they need to do something, they can go out to the sites or call us and we can "rub two sticks together" and bypass the website. (We could also bypass front door if someone twisted our arms.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most customers only look at the website a few times a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, our biggest point of failure is a completely different iot vendor who you probably won't hear about on Hacker News when they, or their data networks, have downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Big Tech lobbying is riding the EU’s deregulation wave by spending more, hiring more, and pushing more, according to a new report by NGO’s Corporate Europe Observatory and LobbyControl on Wednesday (29 October).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Based on data from the EU’s transparency register, the NGOs found that tech companies spend the most on lobbying of any sector, spending €151m a year on lobbying — a 33 percent increase from €113m in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gee whizz, I really do wonder how they end up having all the power!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the response lies in the surrounding ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have a company it's easier to scale your team if you use AWS (or any other established ecosystem). It's way easier to hire 10 engineers that are competent with AWS tools than it is to hire 10 engineers that are competent with the IBM tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And from the individuals perspective it also make sense to bet on larger platforms. If you want to increase your odds of getting a new job, learning the AWS tools gives you a better ROI than learning the IBM tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the cloud compute market is basically centralized into 2.5 companies at this point. The point of paying companies like Azure here is that they've in theory centralized the knowledge and know-how of running multiple, distributed datacenters, so as to be resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that we keep seeing outages encompassing more than a failure domain, then it should be fair game for engineers / customers to ask "what am I paying for, again?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, this seems to be a classic case of large barriers to entry (the huge capital costs associated with building out a datacenter) barring new entrants into the market, coupled with "nobody ever got fired for buying IBM" level thinking. Are outages like these truly factored into the napkin math that says externalizing this is worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consolidation is the inevitable outcome of free unregulated markets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our highly interconnected world, decentralization paradoxically requires a central authority to enforce decentralization by restricting M&amp;amp;A, cartels, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A natural monopoly is a monopoly in an industry in which high infrastructure costs and other barriers to entry relative to the size of the market give the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, an overwhelming advantage over potential competitors. Specifically, an industry is a natural monopoly if a single firm can supply the entire market at a lower long-run average cost than if multiple firms were to operate within it. In that case, it is very probable that a company (monopoly) or a minimal number of companies (oligopoly) will form, providing all or most of the relevant products and/or services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep, even massive cloud providers slip up. Reminds me that depending on “someone else’s infrastructure” still means losing access when things go sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it took a good half hour after we detected the problem to see a notification on the Azure status page. Thanks to those who responded to my question as it validated the issue was global and we contacted our users t right away&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The outage was really weird. For me, parts of the portal worked, other parts didn't. I had access to a couple of resource groups, but no resources visible in those groups. Azure Devops Pipelines that needed do download from packages.microsoft.com didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft status page mostly referenced the portal outage, but it was more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hate these failures because you end up with things that keep working fine because the login credentials are cached, etc; but if you restart or otherwise refresh, you're doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For us, it looks like most services are still working (eastus and eastus2). Our AKS cluster is still running and taking requests. Failures seem limited to management portal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paradox of cloud provider crashes is that if the provider goes down and takes the whole world with it, it's actually good advertisement. Because, that means so many things rely on it, it's critically important, and has so many big customers. That might be why Amazon stock went up after AWS crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Azure goes down and nobody feels it, does Azure really matter?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People feel it, but usually not general consumers like they do when AWS goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Azure goes down, it's mostly affecting internal stuff at big old enterprises. Jane in accounting might notice, but the customers don't. Contrast with AWS which runs most of the world's SaaS products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People not being able to do their jobs internally for a day tends not to make headlines like "100 popular internet services down for everyone" does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High availability is touted as a reason for their high prices, but I swear I read about major cloud outages far more than I experience any outages at Hetzner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the biggest features of the big cloud vendors is that when they are down, not only you but your customers and your competitors usually have issues at the same time so everybody just shrug and have a lazy/off day at the same time. Even on call teams reall just have to wait and stay on standby because there is very little they can do. Doing a failover can be slower than waiting for the recovery, not help at all if outage is spanned accross several region, or bring aditional risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And more importantly nobody lose any reputation except AWS/Azure/Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real reason is that outages are not your fault. Its the new version of "nobody ever got fired for buying IBM" - later it became MS, and now its any big cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one it’s statistics - Hetzner simply runs far fewer major services than hyperscalers. And the services they run are also more affluent, with larger customer bases, so downtimes are systemically critical. Therefore it’s louder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the merits though, I agree, haven’t had any serious issues with Hetzner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DO has been shockingly reliable for me. I shut down a neglected box almost 900 days uptime the other day. In that time AWS has randomly dropped many of my boxes with no warning requiring a manual stop/start action to recover them... But everybody keeps telling me that DO isn't "as reliable" as the big three are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, in the AWS/Azure outages, I don't think any individual (already created) boxes went down, either. In AWS' case you couldn't start up new EC2 instances, and presumably same for Azure (unless you bypass the management portal, I guess). And obviously services like DynamoDB and Front Door, respectively, went down. Hetzner/DO don't offer those, right? Or at least they're not very popular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nope, more than the portal. For instance, I just searched for "Azure Front Door" because I hadn't heard of it before (I now know it's a CDN), and neither the product page itself [1] nor the technical docs [2] are coming up for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we use front door (as does miccrosoft.com) and our website was down, I was able to change the DNS records to point directly to our server and will leave it like that for a few hours until everything is green&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They admit in their update blurb azure front door is having issues but still report azure front door as having no issues on their status page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it's very clear from these updates that they're more focused on the portal than the product, their updates haven't even mentioned fixing it yet, just moving off of it, as if it's some third party service that's down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsubstantiated idea: So the support contract likely says there is a window between each reporting step and the status page is the last one and the one in the legal documents giving them several more hours before the clauses trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do Microsoft still say "If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don't participate in it" today (which PRISM proved very false), or are they at least acknowledging they're participating in whatever NSA has deployed today?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PRISM wasn't voluntary. Also there are 3 levels here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Mandatory&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. "Voluntary"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Voluntary&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I suspect that very little of what the NSA does falls into category 3. As Sen Chuck Schumer put it "you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is funny but also possibly true because: business/MBA types see these outages as a way to prove how critical some services are, leading to investors deciding to load up on the vendor's stock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I may or may not have been known to temporarily take a database down in the past to make a point to management about how unreliable some old software is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was a little puzzled as we got notified our apps were down, and then I tried to login in the Azure portal with no success. But the Azure status page reported no incident, so I posted here and quickly confirmed that others were impacted! They did a pretty bad job with their status page as the front door service was shown green all along&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeing users having issues with the "Modern Outlook", specifically empty accounts. Switching back to the "Legacy Outlook" which functions largely without the help of the cloud fixes the issue. How ironic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing DNS issues resulting in availability degradation of some services. Customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal. We have taken action that is expected to address the portal access issues here shortly. We are actively investigating the underlying issue and additional mitigation actions. More information will be provided within 60 minutes or sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Azure Portal Access Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are investigating an issue with the Azure Portal where customers may be experiencing issues accessing the portal. More information will be provided shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was last updated at 16:18 UTC on 29 October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was having issues a few hours ago. I'm now able to access the portal, although I get lots of errors in the browser console, and things are loading slowly. I have services in the US-East region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been having issues with GitHub and the winget tool for updates throughout the day as well. I imagine things are pulling from the same locations on Azure for some of the software I needed to update (NPM dependencies, and some .NET tooling).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sad thing is - $MSFT isn't even down by 1%. And IIRC, $AMZN actually went up during their previous outage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if we look at these companies' bottom lines, all those big wigs are actually doing something right. Sales and lobbying capacity is way more effective than reliability or good engineering (at least in the short term).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think he was implying that those companies think they are so important that it doesnt matter they are down, they wont loose any customers over it because they are too big and important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a good thing. Stock prices shouldn't go down because of rare incidents which don't accurately represent how successful a company is likely to be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked into this before and the stocks of these large corps simply does not move when outages happens. Maybe intra-day, I don't have that data, but in general no effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no way to tell, and after about 30 minutes, the release process on VS Code Marketplace failed with a cryptic message: "Repository signing for extension file failed.". And there's no way to restart/resume it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We’re investigating an issue impacting Azure Front Door services. Customers may experience intermittent request failures or latency. Updates will be provided shortly."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could be DNS, I'm seeing SERVFAIL trying to resolve what look to be MS servers when I'm hitting (just one example) mygoodtogo.com (trying to pay a road toll bill, and failing).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Azure goes down all the time. On Friday we had an entire regional service down all day. Two weeks ago same thing different region. You only hear about it when it's something everyone uses like the portal, because in general nobody uses Azure unless they're held hostage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Portal and Azure CDN are down here in the SF Bay Area. Tenant azureedge.net DNS A queries are taking 2-6 seconds and most often return nothing. I got a couple successful A response in the last 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: As of 9:19 AM Pacific time, I'm now getting successful A responses but they can take several seconds. The web server at that address is not responding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is much more than azure. One of my kids needs a key for their laptop and can't reach that either. Great excuse though, 'Azure ate my homework'. What a ridiculous world we are building. Fuck MS and their account requirements for windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It begs the question from a noob like me... Where should they host the status page? Surely it shouldn't be on the same infra that it's supposed to be monitoring. Am I correct in thinking that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“ Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing DNS issues resulting in availability degradation of some services.

    &lt;p&gt;I'd say DNS/Front Door (or some carrier interconnect) is the thing affected, since I can auth just fine in a few places. (I'm at MS, but not looped into anything operational these days, so I'm checking my personal subscription).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On our end, our VMs are still working, so our gitlab instance is still up. Our services using Azure App Services are available through their provided url. However, Front Door is failing to resolve any domains that it was responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSO is down, Azure Portal Down and more, seems like a major outage. Already a lot of services seem to be affected: banks, airlines, consumer apps, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The portal is up for me and their status page confirms they did a failover for it. Definitely not disputing that its reach is wide, but a lot of smaller setups probably aren't using Front Door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like MyGet is impacted too. Seems like they use Azure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;What is required to be able to use MyGet? ... MyGet runs its operations from the Microsoft Azure in the West Europe region, near Amsterdam, the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of this outage involves outlook hanging and then blaming random addins. Pretty terrible practice by Microsoft to blame random vendors for their own outage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the eternal tension for early-stage builders, isn't it? Multi-cloud gives you resilience, but adds so much complexity that it can actually slow down shipping features and iterating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm curious—at what point did you decide the overhead was worth it? Was it after experiencing an outage, or did you architect for it from day one?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone launching a product soon (more on the builder/product side than infra-engineer), I keep wrestling with this. The pragmatist in me says "start simple, prove the concept, then layer in resilience." But then you see events like this week and think "what if this happens during launch?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did you handle the operational complexity? Did you need dedicated DevOps folks, or are there patterns/tools that made it manageable for a smaller team?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think I would recommend multi-cloud right out of the gate unless you already have a lot of experience in the space or there is a strong demand from your customers. There's a tremendous amount of overhead with security/compliance, incident management, billing, tooling, entitlements, etc. There are a number of external factors that drove our decision to do it, resiliency is just one of them. But we are a pretty big shop, spending ~$10M/mo on cloud infra and have ~100 people in the platform management department.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would recommend focusing on multi-region within a single CSP instead (both for workloads AND your tooling), which covers the vast majority of incidents and lays some of the architectural foundation for multi-cloud down the road. Develop failover plans for each service in your architecture (eg. planned/tested runbooks to migrate to Traffic Manager in the event AFD goes down)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also choose your provider wisely. We experience 3-5x the number of service-impacting incidents on Azure that we do on AWS. I'm sure others have different experiences, but I would never personally start a company on Azure. AWS has its own issues, of course, but reliability has not been a major one (relatively speaking) over the past 10 years. Last week's incident with DynamoDB in us-east-1 had zero impact on our AWS workloads in other regions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think it's meant to be serious. It's a comment on Microsoft laying off their staff and stuffing their Azure and Dotnet teams with AI product managers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I don't hear about GCP outages all that often. I do think AWS might be leading in outages, but that's a gut feeling, I didn't look up numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does (should, could) DownDetector also say what customer-facing services are down, when some infrastructure is unworking? Or is that the info that the malefactors are seeking?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you. I was wondering what was going on at a company whose web app I need to access. I just checked with BuiltWith and it seems they are on Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I absolutely love the utility aspect of LLMs but part of me is curious if moving faster by using AI is going to make these sorts of failure more and more often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unable to access the portal and any hit to SSO for other corporate accesses is also broken. Seems like there's something wrong in their Identity services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apologies, but this just reads like a low effort critique of big things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, they should get criticism. They should be held liable for any damage they cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that they remain the biggest cloud offering out there isn't something you'd expect to change from a few outages that, by most all evidence, potential replacements have, as well? More, a lot of the outages potential replacements have are often more global in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would say you are explaining why they get a free pass so they still get one - they are bad but their main competitors are even worse!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought one of the major selling points of the big cloud providers was that they were more reliable than running your own stuff (by which i mean anything from a VPS to multiple data centres depending on your scale. Compared to those alternatives they seem to be less reliable in practice!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is to have a multi-region, or even multi-cloud setup, but then bang goes the "they do all the work for you" argument (which i doubt anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That isn't a free pass. You have no data showing how many people did go to competitors over this. You are asserting it is zero, but why do you think that? Going on the talks here, you can find plenty of folks that opted not to go with or stay on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are further asserting that these outages prove they are not still more reliable than home spun. Is that the case? More than a few people aren't ready for a single hard drive to crash on the stuff they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I have non prod environments that don't use FD that are functioning. Routing through FD does not work. And a different app, nonprod doesn't use FD (and is working) but loads assets from the CDN (which is not working).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FD and CDN are global resources and are experiencing issues. Probably some other global resources as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hate to say it, but DNS is looking like it's still the undisputed champ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTTPSConnectionPool(host='schemas.xmlsoap.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /soap/encoding/ (Caused by SSLError(CertificateError("hostname 'schemas.xmlsoap.org' doesn't match '*.azureedge.net'")))&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A service we rely on that isn't even running on Azure is inaccessible due to this issue. For an asset that probably never changes. Wild for that to be the SPOF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another big cloud outage — even “enterprise” systems aren’t bulletproof. Feels like every layer depends on too much hidden glue. Makes you wonder if real redundancy even exists anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; An inadvertent tenant configuration change within Azure Front Door (AFD) triggered a widespread service disruption affecting both Microsoft services and customer applications dependent on AFD for global content delivery. The change introduced an invalid or inconsistent configuration state that caused a significant number of AFD nodes to fail to load properly, leading to increased latencies, timeouts, and connection errors for downstream services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; As unhealthy nodes dropped out of the global pool, traffic distribution across healthy nodes became imbalanced, amplifying the impact and causing intermittent availability even for regions that were partially healthy. We immediately blocked all further configuration changes to prevent additional propagation of the faulty state and began deploying a ‘last known good’ configuration across the global fleet. Recovery required reloading configurations across a large number of nodes and rebalancing traffic gradually to avoid overload conditions as nodes returned to service. This deliberate, phased recovery was necessary to stabilize the system while restoring scale and ensuring no recurrence of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The trigger was traced to a faulty tenant configuration deployment process. Our protection mechanisms, to validate and block any erroneous deployments, failed due to a software defect which allowed the deployment to bypass safety validations. Safeguards have since been reviewed and additional validation and rollback controls have been immediately implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, so far they're saying it's a combination of bad config + their config-validator had a bug. Would love more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;downdetector reports coincident cloudflare outage. is microsoft using cloudflare for management plane, or is there common infra? data center problem somewhere, maybe fiber backbone? BGP?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AWS, now Azure - wasn't this a plot point in Terminator where SkyNet was causing computer systems to have issues much before it finally become self-aware?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, AI has been training on its own data as generated by users writing AI conversations back to the internet - there's a feedback loop at play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah the graph for that one looks exactly the same shape. I wonder if they were depending on some azure component somehow, or maybe there were things hosted on both and the azure failure made enough things failover to AWS that AWS couldn't cope? If that was the case I'd expect to see something similar with GCP too though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: nope looks like there's actually a spike on GCP as well&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definitely also a strong possibility. I wish I had paid more attention during the AWS one earlier to see what other things looked like on there at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you look at the scale of the reports, you find they are much lower than Azure's. seeing a bunch of 24-hour sparkline type graphs next to each other can make it look like they are equally impacted, but AWS has 500 reports and Azure has 20,000. The scale is hidden by the choice of graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, people reporting outages at AWS are probably having trouble with microsoft-run DNS services or caching proxies. It's not that the issues aren't there, it's that the internet is full of intermingled complexity. Just that amount of organic false-positives can make it look like an unrelated major service is impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;winget upgrade fabric Failed in attempting to update the source: winget An unexpected error occurred while executing the command: InternetOpenUrl() failed. 0x80072ee7 : unknown error&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of now Azure Status page still shows no incident. It must be manually updated, someone has to actively decide to acknowledge an issue, and they're just... not. It undermines confidence in that status page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know how to fix this but this community is too close minded and argumentative egocentric sensitive pedantic threatened angry etc to bother discussing it&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed issues on Azure so I went to the status page. It said everything was fine even though the Azure Portal was down. It took more than 10 minutes for that status page to update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can one of the richest companies in the world not offer a better service?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My best guess at the moment is something global like the CDN is having problems affecting things everywhere. I'm able to use a legacy application we have that goes directly to resources in uswest3, but I'm not able to use our more modern application which uses APIM/CDN networks at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Azure status page: "Customers can consider implementing failover strategies with Azure Traffic Manager, to fail over from Azure Front Door to your origins".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I especially like how Nadella speaks of layoffs as some kind of uncontrollable natural disaster, like a hurricane, caused by no-one in particular. A kind of "God works in mysterious ways".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; “Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before,” Nadella wrote. “And yet, at the same time, we’ve undergone layoffs. This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.” &amp;gt; Nadella explained the disconnect between thriving financials and layoffs by stating that “progress isn’t linear” and that it is “sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've read the whole memo and it's actually worse than those excerpts. Nadella doesn't even claim these were low performers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we’ve worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with—our colleagues, teammates, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, so Microsoft is thriving, these were friends and people "we've learned from", but they must go because... uh... "progress isn't linear". Well, thanks Nadella! That explains so much!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you like to mod Java, tinker with builds, or take deep dives into Minecraft’s code? Then this article is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a long time, Java Edition has used obfuscation (hiding parts of the code) – a common practice in the gaming industry. Now we’re changing how we ship Minecraft: Java Edition to remove obfuscation completely. We hope that, with this change, we can pave a future for Minecraft: Java Edition where it’s easier to create, update, and debug mods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An obfuscated history&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minecraft: Java Edition has been obfuscated since its release. This obfuscation meant that people couldn’t see our source code. Instead, everything was scrambled – and those who wanted to mod Java Edition had to try and piece together what every class and function in the code did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we encourage people to get creative both in Minecraft and with Minecraft – so in 2019 we tried to make this tedious process a little easier by releasing “obfuscation mappings”. These mappings were essentially a long list that allowed people to match the obfuscated terms to un-obfuscated terms. This alleviated the issue a little, as modders didn’t need to puzzle out what everything did, or what it should be called anymore. But why stop there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Removing obfuscation in Java Edition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make things even easier – and remove these intermediary steps – we’re removing obfuscation altogether! Starting with the first snapshot following the complete Mounts of Mayhem launch, we will no longer obfuscate Minecraft: Java Edition. This means that this build (and all future builds) will have all of our original names* – now with variable names and other names – included by default to make modding even easier.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Free and open-source software (FOSS) is not merely common on the Internet; it is a deeply embedded and essential foundation of the Domain Name System (DNS), the backbone of how we connect online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) is pleased to announce the publication of SAC132: The Domain Name System Runs on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why This Matters Now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As governments around the world explore new cybersecurity regulations, the ubiquity of FOSS in DNS operations—from domain registration to retrieval—means that policy decisions made today will have direct implications for the Internet's security and resilience tomorrow. SAC132 provides timely, nontechnical guidance to ensure that new policy and regulation serve to strengthen, rather than inadvertently weaken, this critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Key Insights for Policymakers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SAC132 is a foundational guide designed to empower policymakers to strategically manage and sustain the FOSS ecosystem. The report provides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear Foundations – An accessible overview of the DNS and the FOSS development model for nontechnical audiences.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Policy Assessment – Analysis of cybersecurity regulations in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union, with a focus on how they account for FOSS in the DNS ecosystem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Practical Guidance – Concrete findings and recommendations to help policymakers support and secure FOSS as a cornerstone of global connectivity.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We invite all policymakers, technical experts, and stakeholders to read the full report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A Call to Engage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By publishing SAC132, SSAC seeks to raise awareness of the indispensable role of FOSS in maintaining a secure, stable, and resilient Internet. We invite policymakers, technical experts, and all stakeholders to read the full report and join us in conversations about its findings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can engage with SSAC and the broader community at ICANN84, whether in Dublin or by participating remotely. Together, we can ensure that the FOSS ecosystem—and the Internet it supports—remains strong, sustainable, and open for all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we thank all SSAC members and invited experts who contributed to this work, especially co-chairs Maarten Aertsen and Barry Leiba, for their leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’ve always been fascinated by the dithering effect. It has a unique charm that I find so appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;← tap/click the left side to go back&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Look closely, and you’ll see this animation is made of alternating black and white pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But these black and white pixels are specifically arranged to create the illusion of multiple shades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s what dithering does: it simulates more color variations than what are actually used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, it uses black and white to give the impression of multiple gray shades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, dithering is about creating the most out of what we have, and that's what amazes me the most!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It inspired me to learn more about it, and now I want to share what I’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that this is just part one out of three, so I’ll only scratch the surface here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll go deeper in the next parts, which will come soon. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s explore the dithering basics with this grayscale image example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A grayscale image has various gray shades, from black to white.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a display that only shows black or white pixels, no grays. We must turn some pixels black and others white—but how?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way is to map each pixel to the closest available color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pixels darker than medium gray turn black and lighter ones turn white.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This splits pixels into black or white groups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this creates a harsh image with abrupt black-white transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shadow details vanish as gray pixels become fully black or white.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dithering fixes this by selectively pushing some pixels towards the opposite color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some light gray pixels that are closer to white turn black.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, some dark grays turn white.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it's done in a way that produces special patterns which simulate shades by varying the black-and-white pixel densities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Denser black pixels are used in darker areas, while denser white pixels are used in lighter ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next question: How are these patterns generated?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One simple dithering method, known as ordered dithering, uses a threshold map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A threshold map is a grid of values representing brightness levels, from 0 (darkest) to 1 (brightest).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To dither, we compare each input pixel’s brightness to a corresponding threshold value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a pixel’s brightness exceeds the threshold (it’s brighter than the threshold), the pixel turns white. Otherwise, it turns black.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeating this for all pixels gives us the black-and-white dither patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The threshold map is designed to output patterns where the black-and-white pixel density matches the input image’s shades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So brighter input produces patterns with more white, while darker input produces more black.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These black-and-white density variations are what create the illusion of gray shades when viewed from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To dither larger images, we extend the threshold map to match the image size and follow the same principle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare each pixel’s brightness to the threshold map, then turn it black or white accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The image now uses only two colors, but its overall appearance is preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The variations in shades are now replaced by variations in black/white pixel density of the dithering patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s how dithering works in a nutshell: it replicates shades with fewer colors, which are strategically placed to maintain the original look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find it a bit ironic how I used to think dithering ‘adds’ a cool effect, when what it actually does is ‘remove’ colors!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's all for now! We’ve reached the end, but there’s still a lot more to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we haven’t explored the algorithm to create a threshold map. (spoiler: there are many ways!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also another algorithm called error diffusion, which doesn’t use a threshold map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each algorithm creates a distinct, unique look, which I believe deserves its own article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's why I decided to break this series into three parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the next part, I’ll dive into various algorithms for creating threshold maps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the final part, I’ll focus on the error diffusion algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll dive even deeper into dithering's mechanisms in these next 2 parts, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;uv is the best thing to happen to the Python ecosystem in a decade&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;23 October 2025 | Reading time: 6 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s 2025. Does installing Python, managing virtual environments, and synchronizing dependencies between your colleagues really have to be so difficult? Well… no! A brilliant new tool called uv came out recently that revolutionizes how easy installing and using Python can be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uv is a free, open-source tool built by Astral, a small startup that has been churning out Python tools (like the excellent linter Ruff) for the past few years. uv can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install any Python version for you&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manage virtual environments&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solve dependency conflicts extremely quickly (very important for big projects.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s best is that it can do all of the above better than any other tool, in my opinion. It’s shockingly fast, written in Rust, and works on almost any operating system or platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installing uv&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uv is straightforward to install. There are a few ways, but the easiest (in my opinion) is this one-liner command — for Linux and Mac, it’s:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or on Windows in powershell:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then access uv with the command &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;. Installing uv will not mess up any of your existing Python installations — it’s a separate tool, so it’s safe to install it just to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Managing Python for a project&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s always a good idea to work with virtual environments for any Python project. It keeps different bits of code and dependencies ringfenced from one another, and in my experience, it can save a lot of hassle to get into the habit of using virtual environments as soon as you can. uv naturally uses virtual environments, so it’s very easy to start using them if you get into using uv.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uv will build a Python environment for you based on what’s specified in a &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; file in the directory (or parent directories) you’re working in. &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; files are a standard, modern format for specifying dependencies for a Python project. A barebones one might look a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[project]
name = "my_project"
version = "1.0.0"
requires-python = "&amp;gt;=3.9,&amp;lt;3.13"
dependencies = [
  "astropy&amp;gt;=5.0.0",
  "pandas&amp;gt;=1.0.0,&amp;lt;2.0",
]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In essence, it just has to specify which Python version to use and some dependencies. Adding a name and version number also aren’t a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Sidenote: for projects that you publish as packages, such as to the Python Package Index that pip and uv use, &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; files are a modern way to specify everything you need to publish your package.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making a new project with uv&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To start a new Python project with uv, you can run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv init&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which will create a new project for you, with a &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;, and other important bits of boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different ways to run this command, like &lt;code&gt;uv init --bare&lt;/code&gt; (which only creates a pyproject.toml), &lt;code&gt;uv init --package&lt;/code&gt; (which sets up a new Python package), and more. I recommend running &lt;code&gt;uv init --help&lt;/code&gt; to read about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Once you have/if you already have a &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you initialize a project — or if you already have a &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; file in your project — it’s very easy to start using uv. You just need to do&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv sync&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in the directory that your &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; file is in. This command (and in fact, most uv commands if you haven’t ran it already) will:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically install a valid version of Python&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install all dependencies to a new virtual environment in the directory &lt;code&gt;.venv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;uv.lock&lt;/code&gt;file in your directory, which saves the exact, platform-agnostic version of every package installed — meaning that other colleagues can replicate your Python environment exactly.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In principle, you can ‘activate’ this new virtual environment like any typical virtual environment that you may have seen in other tools, but the most ‘uv-onic’ way to use uv is simply to prepend any command with &lt;code&gt;uv run&lt;/code&gt;. This command automatically picks up the correct virtual environment for you and runs your command with it. For instance, to run a script — instead of&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;source .venv/bin/activate
python myscript.py&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;you can just do&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv run myscript.py&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;which will have the same effect. Likewise, to use a ‘tool’ like Jupyter Lab, you can just do&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv run jupyter lab&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in your project’s directory, as opposed to first ‘activating’ the environment and then running &lt;code&gt;jupyter lab&lt;/code&gt; separately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding dependencies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can always just edit your &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; file manually: uv will detect the changes and rebuild your project’s virtual environment. But uv also has easier ways to add dependencies — you can just do&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv add numpy&amp;gt;=2.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to add a package, including specifying version constraints (like the above.) This command automatically edits your &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; for you. &lt;code&gt;uv add&lt;/code&gt; is also extremely powerful for adding remote dependencies from git or elsewhere on your computer (but I won’t get into that here.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pinning a Python version&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I think that one of the most useful things uv can do is to pin a specific Python version for your project. Doing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv python pin 3.12.9&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;would pin the current project to exactly Python 3.12.9 for you, and anyone else using uv — meaning that you really can replicate the exact same Python install across multiple machines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;uvx: ignore all of the above and just run a tool, now!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But sometimes, you might just want to run a tool quickly — like using Ruff to lint code somewhere, or starting a Jupyter notebook server without an environment, or even just quickly starting an IPython session with pandas installed so you can open up a file. The &lt;code&gt;uv tool&lt;/code&gt; command, which has a short alias &lt;code&gt;uvx&lt;/code&gt;, makes this insanely easy. Running a command like&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uvx ruff&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;will automatically download the tool you want to use and run it in a one-off virtual environment. Once the tool has been downloaded before, this is lightning-fast because of how uv uses caches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of occasions when I might want to do this — a common one might be to quickly start an IPython session with pandas installed (using &lt;code&gt;--with&lt;/code&gt; to add dependencies) so that I can quickly open &amp;amp; look at a parquet file. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uvx --with pandas,pyarrow ipython&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, maybe just starting a Jupyter Lab server so that I can quickly open a Jupyter notebook that a student sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uvx jupyter lab&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or honestly just so many other weird, one-off use cases where &lt;code&gt;uvx&lt;/code&gt; is really nice to have around. I don’t feel like I’m missing out by always using virtual environments, because &lt;code&gt;uvx&lt;/code&gt; always gives you a ‘get out of jail free’ card whenever you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;If that hasn’t sold you: a personal note&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I first discovered uv last year, while working together with our other lovely developers on building The Astrosky Ecosystem — a wonderful project to build open-source social media integrations for astronomers online. But with multiple developers all working asynchronously on multiple operating systems, managing Python installations quickly became a huge task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uv is an incredibly powerful simplification for us that we use across our entire tech stack. As developers, we can all work with identical Python installations, which is especially important given a number of semi-experimental dependencies that we use that have breaking changes with every version. On GitHub Actions, we’re planning to use uv to quickly build a Python environment and run our unit tests. In production, uv already manages Python for all of our servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s just so nice to always know that Python and package installation will always be handled consistently and correctly across all of our machines. That’s why uv is the best thing to happen to the Python ecosystem in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Find out more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more on the uv docs, including a getting started page, more in-depth guides, explanations of important concepts, and a full command reference.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Raspberry Pi RP2040 or RP2350 Bit-Bangs 100 Mbit/s Ethernet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;on&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, @kingyoPiyo’s Pico-10BASE-T project drew wide attention right here on Elektor for implementing 10 Mbit/s Ethernet on the Raspberry Pi Pico using just a few resistors. In 2023, another milestone followed with bit-banged USB, showing how far the RP2040’s (and now RP2350) programmable I/O could be pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Can an RP2350 Bit-Bang Next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, developer Steve Markgraf (GitHub @steve-m) has extended the concept with Pico-100BASE-TX — a 100 Mbit/s Fast Ethernet transmitter running entirely in software.&lt;lb/&gt; Markgraf’s implementation uses the PIO and DMA to perform MLT-3 encoding, 4B5B line coding, and scrambling at a 125 MHz symbol rate. The result is a functioning 100 Mbit/s link capable of streaming about 11 Mbyte/s over UDP, demonstrated by real-time audio and ADC data streams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As before, this is a transmit-only proof of concept and must not be connected to PoE-enabled hardware. A pulse transformer or intermediary Ethernet switch is recommended for isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Check Out the Rest of His Repo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example applications in the repository include a counter, internal-ADC streamer, and an audio demo using a PCM1802 converter at 75 kHz. The library supports both the RP2040 and the newer RP2350 (Pico 2) and builds with the standard Pico SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Source: Pico-100BASE-TX on GitHub — check it in action in the video there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the technical achievement, projects like this hint at new possibilities for low-cost, high-speed data acquisition and streaming using microcontrollers that were never designed for it. A Pico capable of pushing 11 MB/s over Ethernet could form the basis of compact, inexpensive test instruments, remote sensors, or experimental network interfaces — all without a dedicated PHY chip. As these bit-banged interfaces become faster and more capable, the question naturally follows: how far can software-defined hardware really go on a two-dollar microcontroller?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On ARM (32-bit and 64-bit) platforms, "word" commonly refers to as a 32-bit value&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;good to know, thought it was the same as x86&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Line 37, do you have a guarantee that _objc_autoreleasePoolPop preserves x7?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could also pop x0 and x1 at once on line 33.&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Andrea Santilli [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Fri, 17 Oct 2025 10:25:30 UTC (3,980 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Mon, 20 Oct 2025 07:29:02 UTC (3,980 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v3] Tue, 21 Oct 2025 14:44:49 UTC (3,980 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I Built an App to Encourage My Kids to Invest â Just One HTML File&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âWhat comes with the milk, leaves with the soulâ&lt;lb/&gt; â Russian proverb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access the app:&lt;lb/&gt; Click here to open and install D-i&lt;del&gt;n&lt;/del&gt;vestments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that school doesnât teach you (not even high school) is how to manage your personal finances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As my eldest sonâs birthday was approaching, we suggested that instead of asking for physical gifts, he ask for their equivalent in money. That way, he gathered a decent amount of capital for his first investment adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I explained to my kids that investing is like having a magic box that generates more money over time. To make it more visual and interactive, I decided to create a small app where they could see their investment grow day by day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;From Idea to App&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first idea was to build a physical piggy bank with a display, showing the accumulated amount. However, that mixed up the concept of saving with investing, and also required buying extra hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I looked for a quicker, cheaper way: revive an old smartphone and create a simple app using plain HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result was D-i&lt;del&gt;n&lt;/del&gt;vestments, a mix between Diversions and Investments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How It Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is essentially a single HTML file that installs on the phone as a PWA (Progressive Web App).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phone is attached to the fridge and works as a panel or dashboard where my kids can see their money growing each day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I act as their investment agent, assigning realistic interest rates â high enough to keep them motivated, but moderate enough to reflect how the real world works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Configuration Screen&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app includes a screen where you can enter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The kidsâ names&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The invested amount&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The interest rate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The start date&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that data, the app automatically calculates and displays:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Daily gain&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Weekly gain&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monthly gain&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Total updated balance&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Materials Used&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An old smartphone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A suction mount to attach it to the fridge&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The D-iNvestments app, in HTML format&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Installation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process is as simple as opening the link from a smartphone and tapping âInstallâ when prompted by the browser.&lt;lb/&gt; From then on, it behaves like a native app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access the app:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Click here to open and install D-i&lt;del&gt;n&lt;/del&gt;vestments&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Final Reflection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal wasnât just to teach my kids the value of money, but to show them visually how investment and time work as allies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each day, as they watch their small fund grow, they grasp the magic of compound interest â and that, more than any gift, is a lesson I hope will stay with them for life.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Estimating the Perceived 'Claustrophobia' of New York City's Streets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi! I’m back with a supplement to a piece in the New York Times’ Street Wars series, which is all about the battle for navigable urban space in New York City. In this article, I’ll go more in-depth about how I devised &amp;amp; computed the claustrophobic metric. We plan to explore this metric further through an in-progress research paper; keep an eye out for that later this year! Let’s begin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New York City is a large place; almost 469 square miles of pretty dense civilization. Within the city, there are thousands of miles of sidewalks. As you walk through different neighborhoods, you may experience a variety of different atmospheres. In Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, it’s quaint and quiet. In SoHo these days, there are so many pedestrians that they spill off the narrow sidewalks. While a neighborhood’s atmosphere is, of course, a function of time, it is possible to get an average consensus of how ‘crowded’ each neighborhood feels by averaging over time. When we say ‘crowded’, we mean not just with people; we also mean with static objects, or street furniture, or, to get even more colloquial, ‘clutter’. When we mix ‘crowdedness’ within the narrow environment of NYC’s sidewalks, we endeavor to call this feeling ‘claustrophobia’, a direct mapping to the definition in psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we’ll discuss how the metric of sidewalk ‘claustrophobia’ was calculated. Then, I’ll talk briefly about how this metric might be interesting and useful to a variety of different stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Methodology - Segmentization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We start with the official planimetric database of NYC’s sidewalks from NYC OpenData at this link. However, the geometries for each sidewalk here are stored as multi-polygons, instead of at the per-segment level. Further, the geometry can be quite complicated, in fact, overly complex for the purposes of our analysis. To mitigate these problems, we perform the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Simplify geometry using Shapely library&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Here, we first simplify the sidewalk geometry to reduce some of the complexity in the street network. We visually inspect several different neighborhoods and find that this minimally changes the shape of the network while moderately reducing the number of points after segmentization.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Segmentize points along sidewalks at least every 50 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Then, we segmentize the simplified sidewalk network. Segmentization is a process that evenly samples points along each sidewalk, at a predetermined threshold. We use a threshold of 50 feet to balance computational complexity and storage constraints with accuracy.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Methodology - Bringing in Clutter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this computational analysis, ‘clutter’ is anything that takes up space on the sidewalk. Narratively, some clutter is aesthetic or unminded by pedestrians (like trees, most seating); then, things like scaffolding are denotatively and connotatively ‘clutter’. To identify different types of clutter, I took walks around several different neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, writing down the different things that I saw. At this point, I tried to match each type of street furniture I saw with a dataset on NYC OpenData, which is a great, official portal that stores hundred of city-related datasets from dozens of city agencies like the Department of Transportation and NYC Parks. To save space, I list all of the datasets I used in next section’s table, along with an access link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We assign points to different clutters with spatial joins. For each point, we add a buffer (think of this as a larger ring, centered at the point) of 25 feet. These buffers act as a net, ‘catching’ nearby pieces of clutter. Multiple points may count a piece of clutter as ‘theirs’ if the clutter is within both points’ buffer area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Methodology - Weighting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We apply a weight to each clutter type based on its estimated size. I admit this is quite naive, and solely based on my ‘experience’ as a pedestrian. In the below table, we present the weight allotted to each clutter type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Possible ways to refine this include conducting a survey, or actually taking into account the square footage of each clutter type. Since some clutters have non-uniform sizes (for example, there are several different configurations of bus stops, each with a different size), and size data was unavailable for some clutter types, we stick with the naive approach for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Clutter Type&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Weight&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fire Hydrant&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Street Signs&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.05&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;link&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Methodology - Traffic&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We derive our foot traffic estimates via large-scale, crowdsourced dashcam data provided by Nexar, Inc. Nexar is a company that manufactures dashcams and explores how downstream data can help make more useful and accurate maps. Of course, these images tell us nothing about pedestrians by themselves. We detect the number of pedestrians in each image via YOLOv7-E6E, a state-of-the-art object detection model with well-documented success in this task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dashcam data points are stored at the latitude/longitude level with a 0-360 ranged directional heading. So, in other words, if you were plotting each point on a map, you’d know exactly where to put it on the map, and you’d also know which direction to put an arrow facing outwards from the point. We then project the points from a Cartesian coordinate system to a NYC-specific projected coordinate system for increased accuracy. To combine the position and the heading, we further increase positional accuracy by creating ‘cones’ to represent the actual field-of-view of the vehicle at the time/place of capture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With access to sidewalk width (in feet) from the basemap described earlier, we compute the number of pedestrians per foot of sidewalk width, at each image. This traffic data is sliced at one-hour increments (this is arbitrary), but our main plots don’t go to this granularity and instead converge at ‘a typical day of traffic’ in NYC in August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work is very exciting for us, but still has some unconquered limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Missing Data Streams&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, there are several clutter types that we identified in our walks around the city, but couldn’t find matching datasets for. This includes, but is not limited to: - Sidewalk eating - Roadside eating - Street lights (could infer via 311 complaints, but haven’t yet done) - Red legacy FDNY alarm boxes - Cellars (not a problem unless open) - Sidewalk plant beds - USPS / Package drop-off containers - Streetside produce markets&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separately, for our dashcam-computed foot traffic counts, we are missing data for about 36.11% of the segmentized points in NYC. This isn’t a huge problem, as we aggregate data at much larger geographic groupings like Neighborhood Tabulation Areas and Census Tracts. Nonetheless, it would be more ideal to use a dataset with more complete coverage of the city. The more temporally and geographically dense data we have, the more we can ‘zoom’ in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Imprecise Data Streams&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to missing data streams, we also use some that are notably imprecise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, New York City’s sidewalk scaffolding is logged at the building permit level, so we compute a radial 150-foot outward buffer to capture all nearby points; in reality, only part of a building’s perimeter will actually have the scaffolding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other imprecision comes from “old” data; for most of the clutter types, we’re able to filter by construction date, meaning that clutters built after the end of our traffic data aren’t included. However, this isn’t possible for all clutter types (we look at this more closely in the “clutter.ipynb” notebook on the claustrophobic-streets GitHub repository).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some spatial visualizations. Below, we map our calculated levels of claustrophobia at the Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) level. NTAs are roughly approximate to New Yorkers’ mental maps of neighborhoods. Some interesting trends emerge that made sense at first glance, at least for me! Namely, most of Midtown Manhattan sees the highest ‘claustrophobia’ levels. This aligns with my anecdotal experience of trudging through crowds in and around Times Square that were quite literally stationary for 15 seconds at a time. However, at this small granularity, we can’t really see where other hotspots emerge clearly, at least from the map’s coloring. Let’s try zooming in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we map our calculated levels of claustrophobia at the Census Tract (CT) level. CTs are much smaller; in 2020, NYC was composed of 2,327 of them. Here, more interesting visual trends emerge. I see areas in Queens colored in red that I remember being extremely crowded when I visited; including Jackson Heights (near LaGuardia Airport) and Flushing (much further out in Queens, at the end of the 7 train). Downtown Brooklyn and Williamsburg also see notably higher-than-average levels of claustrophobia, which lines up with my own experiences. For both maps, Staten Island tends to be colored entirely in blue, meaning lower-than-average claustrophobia; I’ve still not taken the ferry over, so I won’t make any definitive claims, but this at least aligns with the borough’s higher usage of cars, relative to the rest of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, for name recognition, we plot the top 20 and bottom 20 neighborhoods, relative to the city average. See if your neighborhood pops up in either list!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From pv magazine USA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vertical three-dimensional solar tower developer Janta Power announced it has closed a $5.5 million seed funding round led by Mac Venture Capital and Collab Capital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The funds are expected to help the startup scale its patented 3D solar towers that are designed to have high levels of energy density for space-constrained areas. The product has applications for data centers, EV charging hubs, telecom towers, universities, and a range of industrial facilities, said Janta Power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Janta said its single-axis sun tracking tower’s geometry achieves approximately three times the solar surface area exposure of traditional flat arrays in the same land footprint. Each tower’s stacked vertical design captures both low-angle morning and evening light, producing a dual-peak power curve that better aligns with real energy demand, said the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company said its solar tower has a capacity factor 50% greater than traditional solar installations. The capacity factor is the amount of actual electricity produced as compared to the theoretical maximum capacity of solar installed. While typical flat installations have a capacity factor of about 22%, Janta Power said its typical installations achieve a capacity factor of about 32%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company said it can achieve a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as low as $0.05 kWh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company currently offers a 5 kW solar tower, with 1.5 kW rooftop models as well as 8.5 kW and 10 kW towers under development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The towers are currently deployed in pilot programs at major global airports, including Munich International Airport, and Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each structure is engineered to withstand winds of at least 110 miles per hour and as much as 170 mph, and features steel construction and modular helical or pier foundations that eliminate the need for extensive grading, said Janta Power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While single-axis tracker installations concentrate output near midday, Janta said its 3D configuration smooths energy delivery throughout the day, reducing ramp stress on grids and lowering reliance on peaker plants.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;US declines to join more than 70 countries in signing UN cybercrime treaty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 70 countries signed the landmark U.N. Convention against Cybercrime in Hanoi this weekend, a significant step in the yearslong effort to create a global mechanism to counteract digital crime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.K. and European Union joined China, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria and dozens of other nations in signing the convention, which lays out new mechanisms for governments to coordinate, build capacity and track those who use technology to commit crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his speech at the event, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said cyberspace “has become fertile ground for criminals” and has allowed them to “defraud families, steal livelihoods, and drain billions of dollars from our economies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The UN Cybercrime Convention is a powerful, legally binding instrument to strengthen our collective defences against cybercrime,” Guterres said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Illicit flows of money, concealed through cryptocurrencies and digital transactions, finance the trafficking of drugs, arms, and terror. And businesses, hospitals, and airports are brought to a standstill by ransomware attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He added that the convention would be critical for governments in the Global South that need assistance and funding for the training required to address cybercrime — which the U.N. estimates costs $10.5 trillion around the world annually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While many countries did not sign the treaty, the most notable missing signature was that of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Officials at the State Department told Recorded Future News on Friday that Marc Knapper, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, and representatives from the U.S. Mission to Vietnam would be attending the signing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The State Department confirmed on Monday that the U.S. did not sign the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The United States continues to review the treaty,” a State Department spokesperson said in a brief statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.N. Convention against Cybercrime was adopted by the General Assembly in December 2024 and will enter into force 90 days after being ratified by the 40th signatory. Signatories will have to ratify the convention according to their own procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the ceremony, UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly argued that cybercrime is changing the face of organized crime and required global coordination to address. Waly said the convention would be a “vital tool” that will ensure “a safer digital world for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.N. officials said the convention would help governments address terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering and drug smuggling, all of which have been turbo-charged by the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.N. noted that the convention is the first global framework “for the collection, sharing and use of electronic evidence for all serious offenses” — noting that until now there have been no broadly accepted international standards on electronic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also the first global treaty to criminalize crimes that depend on the internet and is the first international treaty “to recognize the non-consensual dissemination of intimate images as an offense.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It creates the first global 24/7 network where countries can quickly initiate cooperation,” the U.N. said. “It recognizes and promotes the need to build capacity in countries to pursue and cooperate on fast-moving cybercrimes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The convention has been heavily criticized by the tech industry, which has warned that it criminalizes cybersecurity research and exposes companies to legally thorny data requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human rights groups warned on Friday that it effectively forces member states to create a broad electronic surveillance dragnet that would include crimes that have nothing to do with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many expressed concern that the convention will be abused by dictatorships and rogue governments who will deploy it against critics or protesters — even those outside of a regime’s jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also creates legal regimes to monitor, store and allow cross-border sharing of information without specific data protections. Access Now’s Raman Jit Singh Chima said the convention effectively justifies “cyber authoritarianism at home and transnational repression across borders.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any countries ratifying the treaty, he added, risks “actively validating cyber authoritarianism and facilitating the global erosion of digital freedoms, choosing procedural consensus over substantive human rights protection.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his speech, Guterres referenced the backlash to the convention, telling member states that the treaty has to be a “promise that fundamental human rights such as privacy, dignity, and safety must be protected both offline and online.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But at its core, according to Guterres, the convention solves one of the thorniest issues law enforcement agencies have faced over the last two decades. Countries have only recently begun to share digital evidence across borders but the convention would increase that practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This has long been a major obstacle to justice — with perpetrators in one country, victims in another, and data stored in a third,” he said. “The Convention provides a clear pathway for investigators and prosecutors to finally overcome this barrier.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m the person my friends and family come to for computer-related help. (Maybe you, gentle reader, can relate.) This experience has taught me which computing tasks are frustrating for normal people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normal people often struggle with converting video. They will need to watch, upload, or otherwise do stuff with a video, but the format will be weird. (Weird, broadly defined, is anything that won’t play in QuickTime or upload to Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would love to recommend Handbrake to them, but the user interface is by and for power users. Opening it makes normal people feel unpleasant feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This problem is rampant in free software. The FOSS world is full of powerful tools that only have a “power user” UI. As a result, people give up. Or worse: they ask people like you and I to do it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to make the case to you that you can (and should) solve this kind of problem in a single evening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take the example of Magicbrake, a simple front end I built. It hides the power and flexibility of Handbrake. It does only the one thing most people need Handbrake for: taking a weird video file and making it normal. (Normal, for our purposes, means a small MP4 that works just about anywhere.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is exactly one button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a fast and uncomplicated thing to do. Unfortunately, the people who have the ability to solve problems like this are often disinclined to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Why would you make Handbrake less powerful on purpose?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What if someone wants a different format?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What about [feature/edge case]?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer to all these questions is the same: a person who needs or wants that stuff can use Handbrake. If they don’t need everything Handbrake can do and find it bewildering, they can use this. Everyone wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a bit like obscuring the less-used functions on a TV remote with tape. The functions still exist if you need them, but you’re not required to contend with them just to turn the TV on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People benefit from stuff like this, and I challenge you to make more of it. Opportunities are everywhere. The world is full of media servers normal people can’t set up. Free audio editing software that requires hours of learning to be useful for simple tasks. Network monitoring tools that seem designed to ward off the uninitiated. Great stuff normal people don’t use. All because there’s only one UI, and it’s designed to do everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;80% of the people only need 20% of the features. Hide the rest from them and you’ll make them more productive and happy. That’s really all it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Also, install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit (Link). Just to make sure that the Container Toolkit is loaded, run &lt;code&gt;sudo service docker restart&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Install the Docker Desktop (Link). You may need to log out or reboot after the installation. After logging back in, launch Docker Desktop to ensure that Docker is running.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, run the following command to start the 📦 container:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$MY_WEB_PORT = 8080  # Web port number for web interface
$IMAGE_NAME = "ghcr.io/st-tech/ppf-contact-solver-compiled:latest"
docker run --rm --gpus all -p ${MY_WEB_PORT}:8080 $IMAGE_NAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;MY_WEB_PORT=8080  # Web port number for web interface
IMAGE_NAME=ghcr.io/st-tech/ppf-contact-solver-compiled:latest
docker run --rm --gpus all -p ${MY_WEB_PORT}:8080 $IMAGE_NAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;⏳ Wait for a while until the container becomes a steady state. Next, open your 🌐 browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080, where &lt;code&gt;8080&lt;/code&gt; is the port number specified in the &lt;code&gt;MY_WEB_PORT&lt;/code&gt; variable.
Keep your terminal window open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🎉 Now you are ready to go! 🚀&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To shut down the container, just press &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+C&lt;/code&gt; in the terminal.
The container will be removed and all traces will be 🧹 cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you wish to build the container from scratch 🛠️, please refer to the cleaner installation guide (Markdown) 📝.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our frontend is accessible through 🌐 a browser using our built-in JupyterLab 🐍 interface. All is set up when you open it for the first time. Results can be interactively viewed through the browser and exported as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows you to interact with the simulator on your 💻 laptop while the actual simulation runs on a remote headless server over 🌍 the internet. This means that you don't have to own ⚙️ NVIDIA hardware, but can rent it at vast.ai or RunPod for less than 💵 $0.5 per hour. For example, this (Video) was recorded on a vast.ai instance. The experience is 👍 good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Python interface is designed with the following principles in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;🛠️ Dynamic Tri/Tet Creation: Relying on non-integrated third-party tools for triangulation, tetrahedralization, and loading can make it difficult to dynamically adjust resolutions. Our built-in tri/tet creation tools eliminate this limitation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;🚫 No Mesh Data: Preparing mesh data using external tools can be cumbersome. Our frontend minimizes this effort by allowing meshes to be created on the fly or downloaded when needed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;🔗 Method Chaining: We adopt the method chaining style from JavaScript, making the API intuitive and easy to understand.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;📦 Single Import for Everything: All frontend features are accessible by simply importing with &lt;code&gt;from frontend import App&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of draping five sheets over a sphere with two corners pinned. Please look into the examples directory for more examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# import our frontend
from frontend import App

# make an app
app = App.create("drape")

# create a square mesh resolution 128 spanning the xz plane
V, F = app.mesh.square(res=128, ex=[1, 0, 0], ey=[0, 0, 1])

# add to the asset and name it "sheet"
app.asset.add.tri("sheet", V, F)

# create an icosphere mesh radius 0.5
V, F = app.mesh.icosphere(r=0.5, subdiv_count=4)

The major APIs are documented using docstrings ✍️ and compiled with Sphinx ⚙️. We have also included&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;jupyter-lsp&lt;/code&gt;to provide interactive linting assistance 🛠️ and display docstrings as you type. See this video (Video) for an example. The behaviors can be changed through the settings.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list of parameters used in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;param.set(key,value)&lt;/code&gt;is documented here: (Global Parameters) (Object Parameters).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📊 Logs for the simulation can also be queried through the Python APIs 🐍. Here's an example of how to get a list of recorded logs 📝, fetch them 📥, and compute the average 🧮.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# get a list of log names
logs = session.get.log.names()
print(logs)
assert "time-per-frame" in logs
assert "newton-steps" in logs

# get a list of time per video frame
msec_per_video = session.get.log.numbers("time-per-frame")

# compute the average time per video frame
print("avg per frame:", sum([n for _, n in msec_per_video]) / len(msec_per_video))

# get a list of newton steps
newton_steps = session.get.log.numbers("newton-steps")

# compute the average of consumed newton steps
print("avg newton steps:", sum([n for _, n in newton_steps]) / len(newton_steps))

    print(line)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some representatives. &lt;code&gt;vid_time&lt;/code&gt; refers to the video time in seconds and is recorded as &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt; refers to the consumed simulation time in milliseconds recorded as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;vid_frame&lt;/code&gt; is the video frame count recorede as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Name&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Format&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;time-per-frame&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Time per video frame&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;list[(vid_frame,ms)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;matrix-assembly&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Matrix assembly time&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;list[(vid_time,ms)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;pcg-linsolve&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Linear system solve time&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;list[(vid_time,ms)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;line-search&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Line search time&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;list[(vid_time,ms)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;time-per-step&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Time per step&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;list[(vid_time,ms)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;newton-steps&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Newton iterations per step&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;list[(vid_time,count)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;num-contact&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Contact count&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;list[(vid_time,count)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;max-sigma&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Max stretch&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;list(vid_time,float)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full list of log names and their descriptions is documented here: (GitHub Pages).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that some entries have multiple records at the same video time ⏱️. This occurs because the same operation is executed multiple times 🔄 within a single step during the inner Newton's iterations 🧮. For example, the linear system solve is performed at each Newton's step, so if multiple Newton's steps are 🔁 executed, multiple linear system solve times appear in the record at the same 📊 video time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to retrieve the raw log stream, you can do so by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Last 8 lines.

At the moment, not all large scale examples are ready yet, but they will be added/updated one by one.

We perform explicit intersection checks 🔍 at the end of each step, which raises an error ❌ if an intersection is detected. This ensures that all steps are confirmed to be penetration-free if tests are pass ✅. The runner types are described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tested 🚀 runner of this action is the Ubuntu NVIDIA GPU-Optimized Image for AI and HPC with an NVIDIA Tesla T4 (16 GB VRAM) with Driver version 570.133.20. This is not a self-hosted runner, meaning that each time the runner launches, all environments are 🌱 fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use the GitHub-hosted runner 🖥️, but the actual simulation runs on a &lt;code&gt;g6e.2xlarge&lt;/code&gt; AWS instance 🌐.
Since we start with a fresh 🌱 instance, the environment is clean 🧹 every time.
We take advantage of the ability to deploy on the cloud; this action is performed in parallel, which reduces the total action time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We generate zipped action artifacts 📦 for each run. These artifacts include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;📝 Logs: Detailed logs of the simulation runs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;📊 Metrics: Performance metrics and statistics.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;📹 Videos: Simulated animations.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that these artifacts will be deleted after a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that you can't judge the reliability of contact resolution by simply watching a single success 🎥 video example. To ensure greater transparency, we implemented GitHub Actions to run many of our examples via automated GitHub Actions ⚙️, not just once, but 10 times in a row 🔁. This means that a single failure out of 10 tests is considered a failure of the entire test suite!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, we apply small jitters to the position of objects in the scene 🔄, so at each run, the scene is slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our contact solver is designed for heavy use in cloud services ☁️, enabling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;💰 Cost-Effective Development: Quickly deploy testing environments 🚀 and delete 🗑️ them when not in use, saving costs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;📈 Flexible Scalability: Scale as needed based on demand 📈. For example, you can launch multiple instances before a specific deadline ⏰.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;🌍 High Accessibility: Allow anyone with an internet connection 🌍 to try our solver, even on a smartphone 📱 or tablet 🖥️.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;🐛 Easier Bug Tracking: Users and developers can easily share the same hardware, kernel, and driver environment, making it easier to track and fix bugs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;🛠️ Free Maintenance Cost: No need to maintain hardware for everyday operations or introduce redundancy for malfunctions.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is made possible with our purely web-based frontends 🌐 and scalable capability 🧩. Our main target is the NVIDIA L4 🖱️, a data-center-targeted GPU 🖥️ that offers reasonable pricing 💲, delivering both practical performance 💪 and scalability 📊 without investing in expensive hardware 💻.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we describe how to deploy our solver on major cloud services ☁️. These instructions are up to date as of late 2024 📅 and are subject to change 🔄.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important: For all the services below, don't forget to ❌ delete the instance after use, or you’ll be 💸 charged for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;📦 Deploying on vast.ai&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Select our template (Link).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Create an instance and click &lt;code&gt;Open&lt;/code&gt;button.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;📦 Deploying on RunPod&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Follow this link (Link) and deploy an instance using our template.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Click &lt;code&gt;Connect&lt;/code&gt;button and open the&lt;code&gt;HTTP Services&lt;/code&gt;link.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;📦 Deploying on Scaleway&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Set zone to &lt;code&gt;fr-par-2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Select type &lt;code&gt;L4-1-24G&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;GPU-3070-S&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Choose &lt;code&gt;Ubuntu Jammy GPU OS 12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do not skip the Docker container creation in the installation process; it is required.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;This setup costs approximately €0.76 per hour.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CLI instructions are described in (Markdown).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;📦 Deploying on Amazon Web Services&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Amazon Machine Image (AMI): &lt;code&gt;Deep Learning Base AMI with Single CUDA (Ubuntu 22.04)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Instance Type: &lt;code&gt;g6.2xlarge&lt;/code&gt;(Recommended)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;This setup costs around $1 per hour.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do not skip the Docker container creation in the installation process; it is required.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;📦 Deploying on Google Compute Engine&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GPUs&lt;/code&gt;. We recommend the GPU type&lt;code&gt;NVIDIA L4&lt;/code&gt;because it's affordable and accessible, as it does not require a high quota. You may select&lt;code&gt;T4&lt;/code&gt;instead for testing purposes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not check&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enable Virtual Workstation (NVIDIA GRID)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend the machine type&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;g2-standard-8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose the OS type&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Deep Learning VM with CUDA 12.4 M129&lt;/code&gt;and set the disk size to&lt;code&gt;50GB&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of late 2024, this configuration costs approximately $0.86 per hour in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;us-central1 (Iowa)&lt;/code&gt;and $1.00 per hour in&lt;code&gt;asia-east1 (Taiwan)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Port number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;8080&lt;/code&gt;is reserved by the OS image.

    &lt;p&gt;Skip the individual downloads and get your entire team on Affinity with SSO via a Canva Enterprise or Canva Districts account. Choose an option below to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes, Affinity really is free. That doesn’t mean you’re getting a watered-down version of the app though. You can use every tool in the Pixel, Vector, and Layout studios, plus all of the customization and export features, as much as you want, with no restrictions or payment needed. The app will also receive free updates with new features and improvements added.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you’re on a Canva premium plan (Pro, Business, Enterprise, Education), you’ll also be able to unlock Canva’s powerful AI tools within Affinity via the Canva AI Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes. Affinity is now brought to you by Canva, and your Canva account gives you access to Affinity and other Canva products and features.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No. You can access all of Affinity’s vector, layout, and pixel tools for free without a Canva subscription. If you’d like to unlock Canva AI tools within Affinity, however, you will need a premium Canva plan.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a brand-new product that gives you advanced photo editing, graphic design, and page layout tools under one roof. It includes highly requested features such as Image Trace, ePub support, mesh gradients, hatch fills, live glitch filter, as well as custom capabilities that allow you to rearrange panels and combine tools to build your own unique studios. Plus, with a Canva premium plan, you can unlock incredibly powerful AI tools such as Generative Fill, Generative Expand, Generate Image/Vector, and more — directly in Affinity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes. With a Canva premium plan you can unlock Canva AI features in Affinity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No, these are only available to those with Canva premium accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Affinity is currently available on Windows and macOS (iPadOS coming soon!).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re busy building our iPad version — stay tuned for updates!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Affinity is optimized for the latest hardware, including Apple silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Absolutely! The new desktop version of Affinity can open all files created in Affinity V2 or V1 apps. However, Affinity V1 and V2 cannot open files that are created or saved in the newer app, Affinity by Canva.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No, it’s the same app, just available on different operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes, you can install Affinity on as many devices as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes! It’s easy to import PSDs, AIs, IDMLs, DWGs, and other file types into Affinity, with structure, layers, and creative intent preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Affinity is available in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Bahasa Indonesian, and Turkish. Keep an eye out for more languages coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Get in touch to speak to our team about how your organization can get set up with Affinity, including SSO.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then all you need to do is stay in one of our pre-built studios: Pixel, Vector or Layout. You’ll find all your favorite tools there, plus some new ones. Since it’s all free, just think of the other creative toolsets as an added bonus!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That’s totally fine. Your Affinity V2 license (via Serif) remains valid and Serif will continue to keep activation servers online. But please note that these apps won’t receive future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the best experience, we recommend using the new Affinity by Canva app.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. The new desktop version of Affinity can open all files created in V2, but older versions (including V2 on iPad) cannot open newer Affinity (.af) files, meaning you won’t be able to work across both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;We don’t have a release date for the new Affinity on iPad yet, so recommend continuing to run V2 independently while you enjoy the new Affinity on desktop.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes. The new Affinity by Canva app will receive free updates and new features over time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You will need to be online to download and activate your license with your free Canva account. From then on, there is no requirement to be online, even with extended offline periods.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;There are some features which do require you to be online, if you choose to use them, such as product help, lessons, stock libraries and integrations with Canva including AI tools.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;We’ll also be releasing new updates and patches regularly, so we recommend connecting from time to time to keep your app up to date, but it's not a requirement of use.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You need a Canva premium plan to unlock all of Canva’s AI features in Affinity. Simply download the Affinity app via our Downloads page and follow the prompts once you click ‘Canva AI Studio’.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An app that adapts to you, not the other way around&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Affinity comes with built-in Vector, Pixel, and Layout studios, but you’re not locked in. Rearrange panels and mix and match your favorite tools to build custom studios. You can save multiple setups, switch between them in a click, and even share with others or download theirs. It’s customization that flexes to your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Your PSDs are welcome here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Import PSDs, AIs, IDMLs, DWGs, and other file types into Affinity, with structure, layers, and creative intent preserved. And because Affinity is free, collaborators can open and edit files without barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Zero bucks given&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, Affinity really is free. You can use every tool in the Pixel, Vector, and Layout studios, plus all of the customization and export features, as much as you want, with no restrictions or payment needed. If you’re on a Canva premium plan, you’ll also be able to unlock Canva’s powerful AI tools within Affinity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI that respects your craft.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you’re on a Canva premium plan, you can unlock powerful AI tools directly in Affinity, such as generative fill, background removal, image and vector generation. Every tool has been thoughtfully integrated to complement and support your creative workflow, not clutter it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Work in the Canva AI Studio, or bring AI tools into Pixel, Vector, and Layout — generate, adjust, edit, and finish without ever switching apps.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Your content in Affinity isn’t used to train AI features — we can’t access local files. For content you choose to upload to Canva, you’re in control. You can review and update your preferences any time in Canva settings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Qt Creator 18 released&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;October 30, 2025 by Eike Ziller | Comments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;We are happy to announce the release of Qt Creator 18!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qt Creator 18 adds experimental support for Development Containers and many more improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Development Container Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qt Creator 18 adds support for development containers to automate setting up the development environment of a project. It detects a "devcontainer.json" file in your project directory and creates a Docker container for it. You can let Qt Creator auto-detect kits or specify custom kits and control other aspects like the command bridge (our service for communicating with remote devices) with Qt Creator specific customizations in the development container definition. Note that it is still experimental and does not support all aspects of development containers yet. Enable the extension to use this functionality. Find out more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;General UI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We added an Overview tab on Welcome mode that aggregates content from the other tabs. It suggests tutorials and examples based on your experience and needs, and highlights developer-targeted posts in the Qt blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The notifications received a facelift and are now part of the progress notification popups. You can opt-out of this with Environment &amp;gt; Interface &amp;gt; Prefer banner style info bars over pop-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Editing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We added the option to use tabbed editors (Environment &amp;gt; Interface &amp;gt; Use tabbed editors). But remember faster ways of navigating your code, such as Locator filters for opening files or jumping to specific class or symbol, Follow Symbol, Find References, the Open Documents and File System views, the edit location history Window &amp;gt; Go Back/Forward and the corresponding keyboard shortcuts, and Window &amp;gt; Previous/Next Open Document in History and the corresponding keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the C++ support we updated Clangd/LLVM to the 21.1 release for our prebuilt binaries. Additionally, the built-in code model received a wide range of fixes for newer C++ features. We added quick fixes for removing curly braces and for adding definitions for static data members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For QML you can now download and use the latest QML Language Server even if you are using older Qt versions for your projects (in the QML Language Server settings in Preferences &amp;gt; Language Client).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also added support for GitHub Enterprise environments for GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Projects&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We moved the ".user" files that contain the Qt Creator specific project settings into the ".qtcreator/" subdirectory of the project directory. Existing ".user" files from older projects are still updated for compatibility though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Projects mode you can now choose to only show kits that are actually usable by the project, or only kits that the project is already configured for. We also split up the Run page into Deploy Settings and Run Settings, and together with the Build Settings moved them out of the kit selection to tabs in the content view. Normally the run configurations of the various build configurations are independent of each other. In Qt Creator 18 we have added the option to sync the run configurations within a single kit, or even between all kits that the project is configured for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For CMake projects we now also support Test Presets and added a Locator filter "ct" for running CTest based tests. We also fixed building CMake projects for all build configurations (Build &amp;gt; Build Project for All Configurations).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Devices&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We added a configuration for various tools on remote Linux devices, like GDB server, CMake, clangd, rsync, qmake, and more, and the option to auto-detect them. This improves the configuration of remote devices as build devices. More is to come in future releases in this regard. You can now also decide if Qt Creator should try to automatically re-connect to devices at startup with a new Auto-connect on startup setting. We also fixed that it wasn't possibly to use rsync for deployment when building on a remote device as well as using a remote target device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Other Improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qt Creator 18 comes with many more improvements and fixes. For example the Git commit editor now provides many more actions on files, like staging, unstaging, and directly adding files to ".gitignore".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please have a look at our change log for more detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;
