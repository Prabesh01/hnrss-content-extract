    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Deploying DeepSeek with PD Disaggregation and Large-Scale Expert Parallelism on 96 H100 GPUs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by: The SGLang Team, May 05, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is a popular open-source large language model (LLM) praised for its strong performance. However, its large size and unique architecture, which uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE), require an advanced system for efficient serving at scale. In this blog, we explain how we match DeepSeek's inference system performance with SGLang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our implementation, shown in the figure above, runs on 12 nodes in the Atlas Cloud, each equipped with 8 H100 GPUs. It uses prefill-decode disaggregation and large-scale expert parallelism (EP), achieving a speed of 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second per node for 2000-token input sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first open-source implementation to nearly match the throughput reported in the official DeepSeek blog at large scale. By deploying this implementation locally, it translates to a cost of $0.20/1M output tokens, which is about one-fifth the cost of the official DeepSeek Chat API. Compared to vanilla tensor parallelism using the same resources, this optimized strategy improves the output throuhgput by up to 5x. This blog dives into our parallelism design, optimization methods, and results. All components of our work are fully open-source, allowing others to explore and build on our efforts. The instructions for reproducing our experiments are fully available here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ SGLang now supports prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation and large-scale EP, including the full functionality of DeepEP, DeepGEMM, and EPLB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ Leveraging these new features, our team successfully replicated DeepSeek's inference system using 12 nodes, each with 8 H100 GPUs. In total, SGLang achieves a throughput of 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second per node for input sequences of 2000 tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ This blog explains technical details of our approach, focusing on optimizations for efficiency, peak memory usage reduction, and workload balancing. The profile results show that our implementation achieves nearly on-par performance with the official DeepSeek’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ All experiments and code are fully open-sourced for community access and further development.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Acknowledgment&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parallelism Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efficient parallelism is essential to manage the computational complexity and memory demands of DeepSeek's architecture. This section outlines our approach to optimizing key components: attention layers, dense feed-forward networks (FFNs), sparse FFNs, and the language model (LM) head. Each component leverages tailored parallelism strategies to enhance scalability, memory efficiency, and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Attention Layers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek employs Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) to effectively model complex dependencies within input sequences. To optimize this mechanism, we implement DP Attention, a data parallelism strategy that eliminates KV cache duplication across devices, significantly reducing memory overhead. Introduced in SGLang v0.4, this approach has been extended to support hybrid data and tensor parallelism, offering flexibility for processing small batch sizes efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Dense FFNs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite using only three dense FFN layers, DeepSeek-V3's computation can significantly increase peak memory usage, potentially leading to system crashes if not carefully managed. To address this, we adopt Data Parallelism (DP) over tensor parallelism (TP), leveraging the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enhanced Scalability: With an intermediate dimension of 18,432, high TP degrees (e.g., TP32) result in inefficient fragmentation into small-unit segments (e.g., 576 units), which are not divisible by 128—a common alignment boundary for modern GPUs such as H100. This misalignment hampers computational efficiency and memory utilization. DP provides a more scalable solution by avoiding fragmentation, ensuring balanced workload distribution across devices.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized Memory Efficiency: Traditionally, TP reduces memory usage as worker size increases, but this advantage diminishes under DP attention. In a pure TP setup, memory demand for a single-layer Transformer model scales with DP size as: $$\text{Memory}=\frac{N_{\text{param}}}{\text{TP}}+(1+k)N_{\text{hidden_state}}\cdot \text{DP}\notag$$ Here, $N_{\text{hidden_state}}=n_\text{token}\times n_\text{hidden_size}$ is the size of the hidden state on each device (DP rank), $N_{\text{param}}=n_\text{intermediate_size}\times n_\text{hidden_size}$ is the number of model parameters, and $k$ is a coefficient representing extra memory overhead from CUDA Graph duplication. By assuming $\text{DP}=\text{TP}$, this memory usage function is minimized when $\text{TP}=\sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{param}}}{(1+k)N_{\text{hidden_state}}}}$. DeepSeek-V3 uses an intermediate size of 18,432. During the prefill phase, CUDA Graph is typically disabled, so $k = 0$. However, the token size per device can easily exceed 2,048, resulting in an optimal TP size of 3 or less. In the decode phase, a practical configuration might use 128 tokens per device and set $k = 3$. In this case, the memory-optimal TP size is 6. In both phases, a lower TP degree minimizes memory usage per device. As a result, DP may offer a more memory-efficient approach for scaling compared to relying solely on TP.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimized Communication Overhead: In pure TP, each FFN necessitates two all-reduce operations, resulting in substantial communication overhead. By leveraging DP, we optimize this process to a single reduce-scatter following the prior attention layer and an all-gather before the next, reducing communication costs by 50%. Furthermore, when attention is also computed under pure DP, inter-device communication is entirely eliminated, significantly enhancing overall efficiency.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The integration of DP dense FFN with DP attention is illustrated in the left figure below. Users can enable this feature by setting &lt;code&gt;--moe-dense-tp-size=1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sparse FFNs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In DeepSeek-V3's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, sparse FFNs require substantial expert weights, creating a significant memory bottleneck. To address this, we implement Expert Parallelism (EP), which distributes expert weights across multiple devices. This approach effectively scales memory capacity while maintaining high performance, though it does introduce challenges like irregular all-to-all communication and workload imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The figure in the right figure above illustrates our EP implementation using the DeepEP framework, with further details on our EP design and optimizations provided in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LM Head&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LM head computes output probabilities over a large vocabulary, a resource-intensive operation traditionally handled with vocabulary parallelism to aggregate token logits from TP groups. To enhance scalability and efficiency, we adopt Data Parallelism (DP), mirroring our dense FFN strategy. This reduces memory overhead and simplifies communication across devices, delivering a more streamlined solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prefill and Decode Disaggregation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLM inference comprises two distinct phases: Prefill and Decode. The Prefill phase is computation-intensive, processing the entire input sequence, while the Decode phase is memory-intensive, managing the Key-Value (KV) cache for token generation. Traditionally, these phases are handled within a unified engine, where combined scheduling of prefill and decode batches introduces inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we introduce Prefill and Decode (PD) Disaggregation in SGLang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Issues with Unified Scheduling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conventional unified engine, which processes prefill and decode batches together, results in three significant problems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefill Interruption: Incoming prefill batches frequently interrupt ongoing decode batches, causing substantial delays in token generation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DP Attention Imbalance: In DP attention, one DP worker may process a prefill batch while another handles a decode batch simultaneously, leading to increased decode latency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Incompatible with DeepEP: As we will discuss in a later section, DeepEP executes different dispatch modes for prefill and decode, making unified scheduling imcompatible with DeepEP.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PD Disaggregation resolves these by separating the two stages, enabling tailored optimizations for each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementation Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PD Disaggregation design in SGLang, depicted in the diagram below, interleaves execution between a Prefill Server and a Decode Server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon receiving an input request, the workflow proceeds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Prefill Server and a Decode Server pair via a handshake, establishing a local sender and receiver, respectively.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Decode Server pre-allocates the KV cache, signaling the Prefill Server to begin the model forward pass and compute the KV caches.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once computed, the data transfers to the Decode Server, which handles iterative token generation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This separation ensures each phase operates under optimal conditions, maximizing GPU resource utilization. To further enhance performance, our implementation incorporates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-blocking Transfer: Data send and receive operations run in a background thread, keeping the scheduler’s event loop uninterrupted.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RDMA-Based Transfer: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) leverages queue pairs for connections and scatter-gather elements (SGE) for efficient transfer of non-contiguous memory chunks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexible API Integration: SGLang offers adaptable APIs that integrate high-performance RDMA libraries like Mooncake and NIXL, streamlining data transfers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More details can be found in our design document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Large-scale Expert Parallelism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Expert Parallelism with DeepEP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepEP, implemented by the DeepSeek team, is a communication library designed to streamline EP in MoE models. It tackles the challenge of efficiently routing tokens to specific experts across multiple GPUs. By providing optimized communication kernels, DeepEP reduces latency and boosts throughput, making it ideal for large-scale inference tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepEP provides two specialized dispatch modes to address varying workload demands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Normal Dispatch: Optimized for handling long input sequences, such as during the prefill phase, this mode prioritizes maximum computational throughput. However, it generates symbolic shapes that are incompatible with CUDA Graph, rendering it less effective for the decode phase, where kernel launch overhead becomes a significant bottleneck.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low-Latency Dispatch: Tailored for generating output tokens during the decode phase, this mode prioritizes minimal delay to ensure real-time performance. It supports CUDA Graph but requires preallocating a fixed memory size. If the memory demand exceeds this preallocation, a runtime error occurs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In SGLang, the integration of DeepEP provides auto mode that dynamically selects between these two dispatch modes based on the workload. However, without PD disaggregation, the auto mode faces a limitation: it cannot simultaneously support both normal dispatch (for prefill) and low-latency dispatch (for decode) within the same communication group. This restriction hinders its compatibility with DP attention, which is crucial for memory-efficient inference. The compatibility of each mode is outlined in the table below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mode&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Long Input&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Long Output&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;DP Attention&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;CUDA Graph&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Normal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Low-Latency&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Auto&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PD disaggregation addresses this by separating prefill and decode phases, allowing normal dispatch for the prefill phase and low-latency dispatch for the decode phase, both under DP attention. This integration optimizes resource utilization and enhances overall performance by aligning the dispatch mode with the specific needs of each phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;DeepGEMM Integration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepGEMM is another high-efficient library developed by the DeepSeek team, specifically designed to optimize computations in MoE models. It provides two specialized functions for handling MoE-related matrix multiplications (Grouped GEMMs), each tailored to different phases of the inference process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout): This kernel is designed for dynamic input shapes, making it ideal for the prefill phase of MoE inference. It processes inputs where the data for different experts is concatenated contiguously, allowing for flexible handling of varying input sizes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grouped GEMMs (masked layout): This kernel assumes a fixed input shape and uses a mask tensor to compute only the valid portions of the input. It is compatible with CUDA Graph, which optimizes kernel launches, making it well-suited for the decode phase where reducing overhead is critical.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepGEMM integrates smoothly with the dispatch modes of DeepEP:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For the contiguous layout kernel, which is used with normal dispatch in the prefill phase, an additional step is required. Since normal dispatch outputs a symbolic shape, a permutation is needed to transform the output into the contiguous format expected by the kernel. We referred to the LightLLM project and implemented a custom Triton kernel for efficient permutation. This kernel ensures that the output from normal dispatch is correctly rearranged, enabling smooth integration with the contiguous GEMM kernel.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The masked layout kernel pairs seamlessly with DeepEP’s low-latency dispatch, as both are optimized for the decode phase and support CUDA Graph.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SGLang also integrates DeepGEMM for MoE computation under tensor parallelism. Additionally, DeepGEMM provides a highly efficient general GeMM kernel, which can be activated in SGLang by setting the environment variable &lt;code&gt;SGL_ENABLE_JIT_DEEPGEMM&lt;/code&gt; to 1, offering even greater computational efficiency for non-MoE operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Two-batch Overlap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In multi-node environments, limited communication bandwidth can significantly increase overall latency. To tackle this challenge, we implemented Two-batch Overlap (TBO) following DeepSeek's system design. TBO splits a single batch into two micro-batches, allowing computation and communication to overlap, which also lowers peak memory usage by halving the effective batch size. However, putting TBO into practice introduces specific implementation difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Implementation Challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although DeepSeek released the design framework of TBO, there are two slight implementation challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code Complexity: Directly coding TBO can lead to duplicated logic for managing multiple micro-batches. This increases the complexity of the codebase, making it harder to maintain and prone to errors, especially as the number of micro-batches or overlapping scenarios grows.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Synchronization Issues in the Prefill Phase: Achieving effective overlap between computation and communication needs consideration when the normal dispatch in DeepEP block the CPU. This blocking behavior can stall the pipeline, leaving the GPU idle and undermining the performance benefits of TBO.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Abstraction for Clean Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a more maintainable and reusable codebase, we use an abstraction layer consisting of operations and yield points. This method simplifies development by allowing us to write code as if handling a single micro-batch, while strategically pausing execution by inserting yield points to let other micro-batches proceed. It eliminates code duplication, reduces the potential need for variable postfixes, and efficiently manages cases where some executions complete at a layer's end while others have not. Additionally, it supports easy adaptation to different overlapping region choices or future enhancements, like a three-batch overlap, with minimal code changes. Below is a concise demonstration of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operations = [
    self._forward_attn,
    YieldOperation(),  # Pause execution for other micro-batches
    self._forward_dispatch,
    self._forward_mlp,
    YieldOperation(),  # Another pause point
    self._forward_combine,
]

# Process a single micro-batch without duplicating code
def _forward_attn(self, state):
    state.hidden_states = self.self_attn(state.hidden_states, ...)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Prefill Overlapping Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We refine the launch order during the prefill phase to avoid CPU-blocking via the dispatch operation in DeepEP, even though we are using its asynchronous mode. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The dispatch operation blocks the CPU until the GPU receives metadata from other ranks to allocate correctly sized tensors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An improper implementation would leave the computation stream idle during this period, as no computation tasks are submitted to the GPU.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To optimize, we prioritize submitting computation tasks to the GPU before launching CPU-blocking communication. This ensures the GPU remains active during communication. As illustrated in the figure below, TBO with a proper launch order, indicated by bolded borders, avoids bubble caused by a CPU-blocking operation (i.e., normal dispatch).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Expert Parallelism Load Balancer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In MoE models, EP often leads to uneven workload distribution across GPUs. This imbalance forces the system to wait for the slowest GPU computation or communication, wasting compute cycles and increasing memory usage due to expert activations. As the number of GPUs (EP size) increases, the imbalance issue gets more severe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this, DeepSeek developed the Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB). EPLB takes expert distribution statistics as input and computes an optimal arrangement of experts to minimize imbalance. Users can allocate redundant experts (e.g., 32 additional experts), which, when combined with the original 256, create a pool of 288 experts. This pool allows EPLB to strategically place or replicate experts—for instance, duplicating the most frequently used expert multiple times or grouping a moderately used expert with rarely used ones on a single GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond balancing workloads, EPLB offers greater flexibility in parallelism design. With the original 256 experts, parallelism sizes are restricted to powers of two. EPLB’s use of 288 experts enables more diverse configurations, such as parallelism sizes of 12 or 72.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the figure below, we demonstrate the effects of scale and EPLB algorithm to the imbalance issue via simulation. We compute GPU balancedness as the ratio between mean computation time and maximum computation time for a MoE layer among GPUs, and we use the number of tokens for a GPU to estimate the computation time for it. As can be seen, utilization rate decreases when the system scales with the number of nodes, and enabling EPLB significantly improves the utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;EPLB for Real-World Serving&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For EPLB to be effective, the input distribution must closely match the actual serving workload. Two strategies enhance this alignment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Increasing Batch Size: Larger batches reduce random fluctuations in expert usage, which improves balance, which can be achieved by scaling the cluster or using techniques like Multi-Token Prediction (MTP).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Periodic Rebalancing: Regularly updating the expert arrangement leverages temporal locality but requires efficient reloading of experts. This necessitates minimizing the cost of expert reloading operations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with EPLB, some imbalance is inevitable, making further optimization a valuable future direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Implementation of Rebalancing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SGLang implements expert rebalancing in three stages to ensure efficiency and minimal disruption:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System Loading Stage: Weights are optionally preloaded from disk to main memory for faster rebalancing or kept on disk with memory mapping (mmap) for reduced memory usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rebalance Preparation Stage: Required weights are asynchronously transferred to device memory in the background, utilizing free DMA hardware engines without interrupting ongoing GPU operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rebalance Execution Stage: A device-to-device copy updates the weights. This step can be further optimized through physical memory rebinding techniques.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This staged approach ensures that rebalancing is both efficient and non-disruptive, maintaining system performance during updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;End-to-end Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Experimental Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the end-to-end performance of different configurations of SGLang using DeepSeek-V3 on a cluster of 12 nodes, connected via InfiniBand and each equipped with 8 H100 GPUs. This evaluation highlights the throughput improvements enabled by our advanced optimization techniques. We compared the following four settings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SGLang with TP16 x 6: Every two nodes are paired with an independent group, running DeepSeek-V3 inference with a TP size of 16 and DP attention.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SGLang with PD Disaggregation: This version incorporates PD disaggregation and full EP optimization. For the EPLB, we adopt a distribution matching the input/output data, as real-time serving statistics are unavailable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SGLang with PD Disaggregation and simulated MTP: To simulate MTP’s effects, we firstly double the batch size and halve the Key-Value KV cache length to maintain the same workload for GroupedGeMM computation and memory access. Moreover, we insert dummy kernels after the real attention computation to ensure the attention phase takes the same time as in DeepSeek’s profile, accurately reflecting the slowdown caused by MTP’s attention mechanism. We conservatively assume a 70% acceptance rate under MTP.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DeepSeek Profile Results: Throughput estimates are derived from DeepSeek’s official profiling data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Performance Analysis of Prefill and Decode Phases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To accommodate varying workload demands, we independently evaluated the prefill (P) and decode (D) phases, assuming unlimited resources for the non-tested phase to isolate and maximize the load on the tested nodes—mirroring the setup used by DeepSeek. The results are summarized below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefill Phase: On 4 nodes (4×8×H100, EP32), the system achieved per-node throughputs of 57,674, 54,543, and 50,302 tokens per second for prompt lengths of 1K, 2K, and 4K, respectively. As shown in the bar chart below, this represents up to a 3.3× improvement over the TP16 baseline, largely attributable to the optimized GroupedGeMM kernel (DeepGEMM) and two-batch overlap. Assuming a perfectly balanced workload, our system’s throughput is within 5.6% of DeepSeek's official profile.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decode Phase: Evaluated on 9 nodes (9×8×H100, EP72; half the scale of DeepSeek), the system achieved 22,282 tokens/sec per node for 2K inputs—representing a 5.2× speedup over the TP16 baseline. Under simulated MTP conditions—with attention kernels intentionally slowed to reflect real-world latency—the system sustained a high throughput of 17,373 tokens/sec per node for 4K inputs, just 6.6% below DeepSeek’s official profile. As shown in the figure on the right, these performance gains are largely attributed to 4× larger batch sizes enabled by EP, which enhances scalability by significantly reducing per-GPU memory consumption of model weights.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Profile Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section compares SGLang’s performance with DeepSeek’s inference system, aligning our experimental setup as closely as possible to DeepSeek’s production environment. We analyze overall throughput and detailed kernel breakdowns, benchmarking against DeepSeek’s blog and public profile data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Overall Throughput&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For prefill, we tested a scenario with 16,384 tokens per device and an input length of 4,096. Due to uncertainty in DeepSeek’s expert distribution, we evaluated two cases: one with default expert distribution and another with simulated perfect EPLB (random expert selection following group-limited routing semantics) as a performance upper bound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are presented below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;16,384&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16,384&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Input Length&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N/A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,096&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,096&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,096&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Throughput (per node)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;32,206&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;62,713&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;50,302&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;59,337&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s profile reports a throughput roughly twice that of its production environment. SGLang with default expert imbalance is 20% slower than DeepSeek’s profile, while the simulated perfect EPLB case narrows the gap to 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decode, the results are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;256&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;2,000&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;18&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Throughput (per node)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14,800&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;18,598&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;22,282&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17,373&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using half the nodes of DeepSeek, SGLang with simulated MTP is only slightly slower than DeepSeek’s profile. In a higher batch size setting (256 sequences, 2,000 input length), SGLang achieves 22,282 tokens per second per node, demonstrating strong scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Detail Breakdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The figure below breaks down kernel execution times for prefill, including unit test results as a theoretical upper bound:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Default EPLB: Communication kernels exhibit longer execution times and higher variance compared to DeepSeek’s profile, likely due to greater expert imbalance. This leads to extended computation stream bubbles, slowing down overall performance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simulated Perfect EPLB: This setup aligns more closely with DeepSeek’s profile, though discrepancies remain, indicating potential areas for optimization.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Comparison with Unit Tests: Both DeepSeek and SGLang have a communication time slower than unit test results, while the latter is achievable when disabling TBO, revealing a potential optimization direction if communication is the bottleneck.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SGLang’s decode kernel breakdown aligns closely with DeepSeek’s, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key observations include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combine Time Discrepancy: SGLang’s combine operation appears 2x slower than DeepSeek’s due to shorter attention computation, causing communication kernels to busy-wait. In the simulated slow attention experiment, combine time matches DeepSeek’s, confirming this hypothesis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MoE Performance: SGLang’s MoE kernels are 25% slower, possibly because DeepSeek’s 18 nodes (versus our 9) distribute experts more efficiently, reducing memory access overhead for GEMM operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dispatch Optimization Potential: Both DeepSeek and SGLang show dispatch times of ~0.17ms per layer, but unit tests with DeepEP reveal a potential of 0.06ms occupying SMs. Currently, dispatch spends significant time busy-waiting for data. Inserting slow dummy kernels between send/receive operations reduces dispatch time to 0.09ms, and in-flight duration analysis using unit test data suggests further improvements are possible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While minor enhancements remain—primarily in kernel fusion under "Other Kernels"—SGLang’s decode performance is largely aligned with DeepSeek’s, with prefill optimization as the next focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ablation Study: Two-batch Overlap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Impact of Batch Size and Attention Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section investigates TBO performance across varying batch sizes and simulated MTP scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TBO delivers two significant benefits in the prefill phase, as evidenced by throughput comparisons and memory usage optimizations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for Larger Batch Sizes: In the vanilla configuration, each device processes up to 8,192 tokens before encountering out-of-memory (OOM) errors at 16,384 tokens. TBO mitigates this by optimizing memory usage for input tokens, enabling inference with batches as large as 16,384 tokens per device. This further boosts performance to 40.5% increase when comparing the TBO flag with all other configurations made optimal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enhanced Throughput: By overlapping computation (e.g., attention and MLP phases) with communication (e.g., DeepEP Combine and Dispatch), TBO achieves a 27% to 35% throughput increase compared to the vanilla setup, even when processing the same token count per device.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TBO’s impact in the decode phase varies by scenario, with performance tied to batch size and attention processing time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real Test Cases: Speedup in practical scenarios is contingent on batch size exceeding a threshold between 64 and 128 tokens. Below this, TBO yields minimal or negative gains (e.g., -27% at 32 tokens/device), as small decode batch sizes hinder kernel efficiency. The speedup reaches 25.5% at 256 tokens with a performance of 22,310 tokens per second.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simulated MTP Scenario: TBO provides the most substantial speedup in simulated MTP cases when processing 128 requests to generate 256 tokens per decode step. This is due to prolonged attention processing time, which aligns computation (e.g., DP Attention layers) with DeepEP communication overhead (e.g., combine and dispatch steps). The evaluation shows a 35% speedup at 128 sequences/device, with throughput 17,552 tokens per second compared to 12,929 without TBO.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Detail Breakdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated three prefill scenarios: TBO with 16k tokens per batch, TBO with 8k tokens, and no-TBO with 8k tokens. The figure below reveals key insights:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TBO Efficiency: Comparing the 8k cases, TBO improves overall efficiency by overlapping computation and communication, as expected.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Batch Size Impact: Reducing the batch size from 16k to 8k with TBO results in a slight slowdown, reflecting diminished kernel efficiency with smaller batches.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kernel Performance: Interestingly, the no-TBO 8k case outperforms the TBO 16k case in per-kernel speed, despite both having an effective batch size of 8k for kernels. This may stem from reduced streaming multiprocessors (SMs) with TBO, potential noisy neighbor effects during overlap, or kernel incompatibility between computation and communication. These findings suggest future optimization directions for SGLang.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the decode phase, we analyzed three configurations: TBO with a batch size of 256, no-TBO with 256, and no-TBO with 128. The time breakdown is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TBO vs. No-TBO (Batch Size 256): Without TBO, communication time increases significantly due to the lack of overlap. However, computation kernels, particularly GEMM, benefit from a larger effective batch size, resulting in faster execution.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TBO (256) vs. No-TBO (128): Comparing cases with the same kernel batch size, only non-overlapped communication slows down in the no-TBO setup, while computation remains consistent. Unlike prefill, decode communication kernels either fully utilize SMs (during send/receive) or none (during inflight waiting), avoiding resource contention with computation kernels.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ablation Study: EPLB&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section evaluates the impact of the EPLB on system performance through overall throughput analysis and detailed case studies. Given EPLB's sensitivity to workload distribution and distribution shifts in production environments, we focus on qualitative and generalizable insights rather than real-world performance, which requires production data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Overall Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The figure below illustrates EPLB's effect on throughput in large-scale settings. EPLB delivers a significant speedup of 1.49x (prefill) and 2.54x (decode), as expected, due to its ability to mitigate workload imbalances across GPUs. As the number of ranks scales, imbalances grow, and EPLB effectively addresses this in our large-scale experiments, leading to notable throughput improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Case Study: Workload Imbalance Versus Overall Throughput&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explore the relationship between workload imbalance and throughput, we conducted a case study using a decode experiment with 1800 input tokens, 100 output tokens, and a batch size of 256. Throughput and balancedness (average token count divided by maximum token count across experts) were plotted against decoding steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results reveal a strong correlation between balancedness and throughput, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high balancedness for optimal performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Case Study: Expert Distribution Statistics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following figure presents expert distribution statistics for prefill and decode sample data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key observations include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Imbalance in Expert Usage: Most experts are infrequently used, while a small subset is heavily utilized, underscoring the inherent imbalance in MoE models.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefill vs. Decode Differences: Although prefill and decode distributions share similarities, notable differences exist. This supports the use of PD disaggregation, which enables distinct expert placements for each phase, optimizing performance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These findings highlight EPLB's role in addressing workload imbalances and the value of tailoring expert placement to phase-specific demands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Toolkits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Disposable Tensor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory management in PyTorch can be challenging due to persistent object references, especially in GPU-intensive workflows where CUDA memory is a scarce resource. Consider the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def ffn(hidden_state: torch.Tensor, linear1: nn.Linear, linear2: nn.Linear):
    intermediate_state = linear1(hidden_state)
    del hidden_state  # Attempt to free memory, but no effect due to external reference
    return linear2(nn.ReLU(intermediate_state))

hidden_state = ffn(hidden_state, linear1, linear2)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this code, &lt;code&gt;del hidden_state&lt;/code&gt; is intended to release the memory occupied by &lt;code&gt;hidden_state&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;intermediate_state&lt;/code&gt; is computed. However, as &lt;code&gt;hidden_state&lt;/code&gt; is still referenced outside the function, the &lt;code&gt;del&lt;/code&gt; operation has no effect. This increases peak memory usage, risking performance slowdowns or out-of-memory errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SGLang addresses this with the DisposableTensor class, a subclass of &lt;code&gt;torch.Tensor&lt;/code&gt; which introduces a dispose() method to explicitly and immediately release a tensor’s memory, circumventing Python’s reference counting limitations. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def ffn(hidden_state: torch.Tensor, linear1: nn.Linear, linear2: nn.Linear):
    intermediate_state = linear1(hidden_state)
    hidden_state.dispose()  # Immediately releases CUDA memory
    return linear2(nn.ReLU(intermediate_state))

# Wrap the tensor in DisposableTensor
hidden_state = DisposableTensor(hidden_state)
hidden_state = ffn(hidden_state, linear1, linear2)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By wrapping &lt;code&gt;hidden_state&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;DisposableTensor&lt;/code&gt; and calling &lt;code&gt;dispose()&lt;/code&gt; when it’s no longer needed, the CUDA memory is freed right away. This ensures that memory is released as soon as the tensor’s role in the computation is complete, reducing peak memory usage and improving overall efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Expert Workload Extraction and Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SGLang also includes a toolset for analyzing and simulating expert workload distribution in MoE models. This feature enables users to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dump Expert Workload Statistics: Extract either accumulated statistics or per-batch workload data. Accumulated stats support the EPLB manager for real-time optimization, while per-batch data provides granular insights for analysis and simulation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simulate Expert Utilization: Model expert balance across various configurations without requiring costly hardware or repeated trials. For instance, users can gather workload data from a modest setup (e.g., 2x8xH100 or 8xH200) and simulate the performance for a large-scale 22-node deployment.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This simulation capability allows users to evaluate how factors like rebalancing frequency, node count, or batch size impact system performance. It’s a cost-effective way to fine-tune configurations before scaling up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Limitations and Future Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While our implementation of SGLang for DeepSeek-V3 inference demonstrates significant throughput improvements, several limitations and areas for future enhancement remain:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Latency Optimization: The current focus on throughput leaves Time to First Token (TTFT) at 2–5 seconds and Inter-Token Latency (ITL) at approximately 100ms, requiring further optimizations for real-time use cases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sequence Length Constraints: Limited to shorter sequences due to the use of 96 GPUs. Expanding GPU resources would support longer sequences, essential for specific applications.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Integration: SGLang supports MTP but lacks full integration with DP attention, reducing efficiency in mixed parallelism configurations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EPLB Distribution: The experiments in this blog utilizes in-distribution data for Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB), which may not reflect real-world variability. Future work should experiment performances when having distribution shifts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexible Tensor Parallelism (TP) Sizes: For DeepSeek-V3, memory-optimal TP sizes for dense FFNs are small but larger than 1. Currently, SGLang only supports pure TP or DP, leading to suboptimal memory use. Flexible TP options are needed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Blackwell Support: Currently, our implementation supports only the NVIDIA Hopper architecture. We are actively working to extend compatibility to the next-generation Blackwell architecture. If you are interested in supporting or sponsoring this development, welcome to contact lmsys.org@gmail.com.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By leveraging PD disaggregation, EP, and a carefully crafted parallelism design, we’ve reproduced DeepSeek’s inference framework in SGLang with exceptional performance. Our open-source efforts—achieving 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second—demonstrate SGLang’s power for large-scale LLM inference. We invite the community to explore, replicate, and extend this work to push the boundaries of efficient AI deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Do the simplest thing that could possibly work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When designing software systems, do the simplest thing that could possibly work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s surprising how far you can take this piece of advice. I genuinely think you can do this all the time. You can follow this approach for fixing bugs, for maintaining existing systems, and for architecting new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of engineers design by trying to think of the “ideal” system: something well-factored, near-infinitely scalable, elegantly distributed, and so on. I think this is entirely the wrong way to go about software design. Instead, spend that time understanding the current system deeply, then do the simplest thing that could possibly work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simple can be underwhelming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System design requires competence with a lot of different tools: app servers, proxies, databases, caches, queues, and so on. As they gain familiarity with these tools, junior engineers naturally want to use them. It’s fun to construct systems out of many different components! And it feels very satisfying to draw boxes and arrows on a whiteboard - like you’re doing real engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, as with many skills, real mastery often involves learning when to do less, not more. The fight between an ambitious novice and an old master is a well-worn cliche in martial arts movies: the novice is a blur of motion, flipping and spinning. The master is mostly still. But somehow the novice’s attacks never seem to quite connect, and the master’s eventual attack is decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In software, this means that great software design looks underwhelming. It doesn’t look like anything much is happening at all. You can tell you’re in the presence of great software design because you start having thoughts like “oh, I didn’t realise the problem was that easy” or “oh nice, you don’t actually have to do anything difficult”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unicorn is great software design, because it delivers all the most important guarantees in a web server (request isolation, horizontal scaling, crash recovery) by leaning on Unix primitives1. The industry-standard Rails REST API is great software design, because it gives you exactly what you need for a CRUD app in the most boring way possible. I don’t think any of these are impressive software. But they’re impressive feats of design, because they do the simplest thing that could possibly work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should do that too! Suppose you’ve got a Golang application that you want to add some kind of rate limiting to. What’s the simplest thing that could possibly work? Your first idea might be to add some kind of persistent storage (say, Redis) to track per-user request counts with a leaky-bucket algorithm. That would work! But do you need a whole new piece of infrastructure? What if instead you kept those per-user request counts in-memory? Sure, you’d lose some rate limiting data when the application is restarted, but does that matter? Actually, are you sure your edge proxy2 doesn’t support rate limiting already? Could you just write a couple of lines in a config file instead of implementing the feature at all?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe your edge proxy doesn’t support rate limiting. Maybe you can’t track it in-memory because you have too many server instances running in parallel, so the tightest rate limit you could enforce that way is too wide. Maybe it’s a dealbreaker if you ever lose rate limiting data, because people are hammering your service that hard. In that case, the simplest thing that could possibly work is adding persistent storage, so you should go and do that. But if you could do one of the easier approaches, wouldn’t you want to?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You really can build a whole application from scratch this way: start with the absolute simplest thing, and then only extend it when you have new requirements that force you to. It sounds silly, but it works. Think of it as taking YAGNI as the ultimate design principle: above single-responsibility, above choosing the best tool for the job, and above “good design”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What’s wrong with doing the simplest thing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, there are three big problems with always doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. The first is that, by not anticipating future requirements, you end up with an inflexible system or a big ball of mud. The second is that it’s not clear what “simplest” means, so at worst I’m saying “to design well, always do good design”. The third is that you ought to be building systems that can scale, not systems that just work right now. Let’s take those objections in order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Big balls of mud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To some engineers, “do the simplest thing that could possibly work” sounds like I’m telling them to stop doing engineering. If the simplest thing is usually a quick kludge, does that mean this advice will inevitably lead to a complete mess? We’ve all seen codebases with hacks stacked on top of hacks, and they definitely don’t look like good design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But are hacks simple? I actually don’t think so. The problem with a hack or a kludge is precisely that it isn’t simple: that it adds complexity to the codebase by introducing another thing you have to always remember. Hacks are just easier to think of. Figuring out the proper fix is hard because it requires having to understand the entire codebase (or large sections of it). In fact, the proper fix is almost always much simpler than the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not easy to do the simplest thing that could possibly work. When you’re looking at a problem, the first few solutions that come to mind are unlikely to be the simplest ones. Figuring out the simplest solution requires considering many different approaches. In other words, it requires doing engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What is simplicity?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engineers disagree a lot about what constitutes simple code. If “simplest” already means “with good design”, is it just a tautology to say “you should do the simplest thing that could possibly work?” In other words, is Unicorn really simpler than Puma3? Is adding in-memory rate limiting really simpler than using Redis? Here’s a rough, intuitive definition of simplicity4:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple systems have fewer “moving pieces”: fewer things you have to think about when you’re working with them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple systems are less internally-connected. They are composed from components with clear, straightforward interfaces&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unix processes are simpler than threads (and thus Unicorn is simpler than Puma) because processes are less connected: they do not share memory. This makes a lot of sense to me! But I don’t think it gives you the tools to figure out what’s simpler in every case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about in-memory rate limiting vs Redis? On the one hand, in-memory is simpler because you don’t have to think about all the things involved in standing up a separate service with persistent memory. On the other hand, Redis is simpler because the rate limiting guarantees it offers are more straightforward - you don’t have to worry about the case where one server instance thinks a user is rate limited and another one doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I’m not sure what “seems” simpler to me, I like to use this tiebreaker: simple systems are stable. If you’re comparing two states of a software system, and one will require more ongoing work if no requirements change, the other one is simpler. Redis must be deployed and maintained, it can have its own incidents, it requires its own monitoring, it requires a separate deployment in any new environments the service finds itself in, and so on. Thus in-memory rate limiting is simpler than Redis5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why wouldn’t you want to be scalable?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A certain type of engineer is now screaming to themselves “but in-memory rate limiting won’t scale!” Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work will emphatically not deliver the most web-scale system. It will deliver a system that works well at the current scale. Is this irresponsible engineering?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. In my view, the cardinal sin of big tech SaaS engineering is an obsession with scale. I’ve seen so much unavoidable pain caused by over-engineering systems to prepare for several orders of magnitude more than the current scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main reason to not try this is that it doesn’t work. In my experience, for any non-trivial codebase, you can’t anticipate how it will behave at several orders of magnitude more traffic, because you don’t know ahead of time where all the bottlenecks are going to be. At most you can try to make sure you’re ready for 2x or 5x the current traffic, and then stand by to deal with problems as they come in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other reason not to try this is that it makes your codebase inflexible. It’s fun to decouple your service into two pieces so they can be scaled independently (I have seen this happen maybe ten times, and I have seen them actually be usefully scaled independently maybe once). But that makes certain features very hard to implement, because they now require coordination over the wire. In the worst case, they require transactions over the wire, which is a genuinely hard engineering problem. Most of the time you just don’t have to do any of this!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The longer I spend working in tech, the less optimistic I become about our collective ability to predict where a system is going. It’s hard enough to get your head around where a system currently is. And in fact, that’s the main practical difficulty in doing good design: getting an accurate big-picture understanding of the system. Most design is done without that understanding, and most design is thus pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are, broadly speaking, two ways to develop software. The first is to predict what your requirements might look like six months or a year from now, and then design the best system for that purpose. The second is to design the best system for what your requirements actually look like right now: in other words, to do the simplest thing that could possibly work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edit: this article has gotten some comments on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One interesting comment thread says that simplicity of architecture doesn’t matter at scale, because the complexity of “state space exploration in implementation” (I think that means something like what I wrote about here) dominates any other complexity. I disagree - the more complex your feature interactions become, the more important a simple architecture becomes, because your “complexity budget” is almost exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also want to credit Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck for inventing the expression - I genuinely thought I’d just come up with the wording myself, but I almost certainly just remembered it. Oops! Thanks to the HN user ternaryoperator for pointing this out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s just Unix sockets and forked processes! I love Unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every tech company has some kind of edge proxy.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do like Puma and think it’s a good web server. There are definitely use cases where you’d pick it over Unicorn (though in those cases I would personally think hard about using a different language than Ruby).&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m influenced here by Rich Hickey’s great talk Simple Made Easy. I don’t agree with all of it (I think familiarity does in fact contribute to simplicity in practice) but it’s definitely worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if the system has to scale horizontally more than a little bit, in-memory rate limiting won’t work and must be replaced with something like Redis. But in my experience a Golang service can scale a lot without having to scale horizontally to more than a handful of replicas.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Information Retrieval&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 28 Aug 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings, there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.IR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;From Multi-Head to Latent Attention: The Evolution of Attention Mechanisms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is attention?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any autoregressive model, the prediction of the future tokens is based on some preceding context. However, not all the tokens within this context equally contribute to the prediction, because some tokens might be more relevant than others. The attention mechanism addresses this by allowing the model to concentrate on the important context words selectively, while generating each output word or token. Consider the popular example that explains the attention mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this sentence, the pronoun “it” could refer to either “animal” or “street”. Attention helps the model to associate “it” with “animal” rather than “street” by weighing the relative importance of each word. This helps the model to understand the relationships between words and capture the contextual meaning in various NLP tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How is attention calculated?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are various types of attention mechanisms today, beginning with the Multi-Head Attention (MHA), which introduced the attention concept in the seminal paper. More recently, advanced variants like Multi-Latent Head Attention (MHLA) have been employed in popular models like Deepseek. This blog aims to cover the fundamentals of each attention mechanism, including the core ideas, advantages, limitations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Key Concepts in Attention Mechanisms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before diving into specific types of attention, we need to understand some fundamental concepts that underpin all the various attention mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main idea behind the attention mechanism is to dynamically weigh, and focus on relevant parts of inputs. Attention is required in both the encoding and decoding stages. But in this blog, we will be discussing this from a decoder's point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During each generation step, we need to understand the attention weights, which help us to get a better contextual representation for the next word prediction. At its core, attention operates through three fundamental components — queries, keys, and values — that work together with attention scores to create a flexible, context-aware vector representation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Query (Q): The query is a vector that represents the current token for which the model wants to compute attention.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Key (K): Keys are vectors that represent the elements in the context against which the query is compared, to determine the relevance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attention Scores: These are computed using Query and Key vectors to determine the amount of attention to be paid to each context token.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Value (V): Values are the vectors that represent the actual contextual information. After calculating the attention scores using Query and Key vectors, these scores are applied against Value vectors to get the final context vector&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;KV Caching: Since the key and value vectors are for previous tokens, we can skip this computation for those tokens that are already calculated. KV caching stores the precomputed keys and values from the previous computations, which helps in faster decoding in autoregressive models by reusing the cached vectors. However, the Query vectors cannot be cached, since they are calculated for the current token.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand how each of these vectors are scores are calculated you can refer to this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high-level concepts remain consistent across all types of attention mechanisms. However, the key difference lies in how efficiently each of them executes the attention process without compromising on performance. Innovations focus on computational speed, reducing memory usage, improving scalability across longer sequences, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let's dive into each of these techniques&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multi-Head Attention (MHA)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In multi-head attention, for computing the attention weights for the ith token, first, a query vector is calculated for that token. To calculate the attention weights for the token, this query vector is compared with all the preceding tokens. For that, key vectors are calculated for all the preceding tokens. These comparisons will generate an attention score, which is then used to produce a weighted score for each token using the corresponding value vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In multi-head attention, this process is repeated in parallel across multiple attention “heads”. Each head has its own query, value, and key vectors, using which it calculates the relationship between the words. The final output context vector will be the concatenated output from all the attention heads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, this seems straightforward. However, as the context grows, the number of Key and Value vectors will increase dramatically, because these vectors need to be calculated and stored for all the context tokens. For a sequence length of n, each query vector must be compared against all n key vectors and then perform the weighted combination using n value vectors. This results in a quadratic complexity in both computation and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KV cache can help in reducing the computation and memory overhead during inference. But as the context grows, the size of the cache grows linearly with sequence length to store all the keys and values for all the preceding tokens. KV cache reduces the redundant computations, but will not reduce the fundamental cost of attending to all the previous tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Models using MHA – Bert, RoBerta, T5, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multi-Query Attention (MQA)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A significant challenge with MHA was the high computational and memory overhead associated with storing and processing separate Key and Value vectors for each attention head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MQA addresses this problem by using multiple query heads but sharing a common set of Key and Value vectors across all the heads. In other words, there are still “h” distinct Query projections using which the model attends the current token from multiple perspectives. But the same Key and Value vectors are used for every head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach will greatly reduce the memory bandwidth requirements without significantly sacrificing the model performance. By sharing the Key and Value vectors, MQA enables an efficient inference, especially for Large language models with long context lengths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the Key and Value vectors need to be calculated only once for a token instead of “h” times, which reduces the computation cost of Key/Value projection. But note that for calculating the attention score, each query head is still multiplied by the Key vectors and then weighed using the Value vectors. So this remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, with MQA only one set of Key-Value pairs needs to be cached, regardless of the number of Query heads. This lets the KV cache size grow gradually as the sequence length grows, leading to much lower memory requirements when compared to MHA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Models using MQA – PaLM, Falcon&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Grouped Query Attention (GQA)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grouped Query attention offers a balance between the MHA and MQA. As we saw earlier, traditional MHA requires significant memory and computation overhead due to separate Key-Value vectors for each Query head, and the computation overhead even increases as the number of heads increases. MQA addresses this by having a shared Key-Value, which reduces the computation cost and memory, but it may impact the model performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GQA offers a compromise between these two extremes. Instead of having a common Key-Value for all the heads, GQA divides the Query heads into “g” groups and lets each group share a common Key and Value head. We can say, MHA and MQA come as two extreme cases of GQA, with g=1 leading to MQA and g=h leading to MHA. This approach reduces the memory and computational requirements compared to MHA while retaining a better performance than MQA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Models using GQA – Llama2, Llama3, Mistral&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multi-Head Latent Attention (MHLA)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While GQA performs better than MQA, but still may not match MHA’s performance in some complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MHLA is a recent innovation in transformer architecture introduced in models like DeepSeek. Its main goal is to dramatically reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, especially for large language models (LLMs), without loss in model performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to attain a performance near MHA. So we need to consider separate Key value heads for each attention head, like in MHA, but also improve the inference speed by reducing the memory overhead for storing the large amounts of Key value vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MHLA addresses the challenge of high memory usage and slow inference by compressing the Key and Value representations into a much smaller latent space using low-rank projections. Specifically, instead of storing the full Key and Value vectors for every token and head, MHLA applies a linear transformation that projects these vectors into a lower-dimensional space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So during the inference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A down-projection weight matrix W(DKV) is introduced and is multiplied with the input sequence to obtain a compressed latent vector C(KV) for keys and Values. This latent vector is stored in cache, which is significantly smaller in size when compared to the full key and Value vectors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is then multiplied by an up-projection matrix W(UK) and W(UV) to get the Key and Value vectors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Additionally, the matrix W(KR) is used to produce a decoupled Key that carries the Rotary Positional embedding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Additionally, the same process is done for attention Queries as well, which will reduce the activation memory during training&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MHLA supports switching between two computation paradigms for different stages. During the training stage, which is computationally intensive, it operates similarly to MHA, where the computational overhead is slightly lower than conventional MHA. During inference, it can seamlessly switch to a paradigm similar to MQA. Here, the cached KV head interacts with all query heads to produce the final output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Models using MHLA– Deepseek- V2, Deep seek V2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the topics discussed, there are various innovative methods that are designed to optimise the challenges of the traditional attention technique. Some of these include sparse attention, efficient attention, memory augmented attention, etc. These approaches reflect the focus on ongoing research for making the attention more scalable, faster, and adaptable across various tasks and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

Basic Privacy Settings&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access Firefox’s settings by clicking the menu button (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner and selecting “Settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Change Default Search Engine: In the Search tab, change the “Default Search Engine” to a privacy-respecting option like DuckDuckGo.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Enable HTTPS-Only Mode: In the Privacy &amp;amp; Security tab, scroll down to “HTTPS-Only Mode” and select “Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows.”&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Disable Telemetry: Still in Privacy &amp;amp; Security, scroll to “Firefox Data Collection and Use” and uncheck all the boxes to stop Firefox from sending data back to Mozilla.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Set Enhanced Tracking Protection to Strict: Under Privacy &amp;amp; Security, set “Enhanced Tracking Protection” to Strict. This offers stronger protection against trackers. If a site breaks, you can easily disable it for that specific site by clicking the shield icon in the address bar.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Recommended Extensions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Install uBlock Origin: A comprehensive content blocker that stops ads and tracking scripts, which speeds up page loading and enhances privacy.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Install ClearURLs: This extension automatically removes tracking elements from URLs, helping prevent another form of web tracking.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Install Privacy Badger: From the Electronic Frontier Foundation, this extension automatically learns to block invisible trackers. Instead of relying on blocklists, it discovers trackers based on behavior.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Advanced Configuration (&lt;code&gt;about:config&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To access this, type &lt;code&gt;about:config&lt;/code&gt; into the address bar and accept the warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: Changing advanced configuration preferences can impact Firefox performance or security. Proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt; Isolate Cookies to the First-Party Domain: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Search for &lt;code&gt;privacy.firstparty.isolate&lt;/code&gt;and set its value to&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;This prevents cookies from tracking you from one site to another, but it can break single sign-on on some websites.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Search for &lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Resist Fingerprinting: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;I previously set &lt;code&gt;privacy.resistFingerprinting&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;to make my browser fingerprint less unique.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It caused minor display issues on some sites and broke image uploads to Bluesky, so I set it back to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I previously set &lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;By following this checklist, you can significantly improve your privacy while using Firefox. Please let me know if I’m missing anything in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re of a certain age (and not American), there’s a specific corporate font you’re most likely aware of. You may not know its exact name, and you may not actively remember it, but once you see it, you know exactly what you’re looking at. The font’s called Nokia Sans (and Nokia Serif), and it was used by pretty much every single Nokia device between roughly 2002 and 2013 or so, when it was replaced by a very bland font made by Bruno Maag (with help from the person who designed Comic Sans) that they used after that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t remember why, exactly, but I got majorly nostalgic for Nokia’s characteristic, recognisable font, and decided to see if it would work as a user interface font. Now, the font is still owned by Nokia and I couldn’t find a proper place to download it, but I eventually stumbled upon a site that had each individual variant listed for download. I downloaded each of them, installed them using KDE’s font installation method, and tried it out as my user interface font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll quickly discover you shouldn’t use the regular variant, but should instead opt for the Nokia Sans Wide variant. Back in 2011, when Nokia originally announced it was replacing Nokia Sans, the creator of the font, Erik Spiekermann, responded to the announcement on his blog. Apparently, one of the major reasons for Nokia to change fonts was that they claimed Nokia Sans wouldn’t work as a user interface font, but Spiekermann obviously disagrees, pointing specifically to the Wide variant. In fact, Spiekermann does not pull any punches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 years it was high time to look at Nokia’s typefaces as the dominant visual voice of the brand but whoever decided on a completely new direction was either not aware of what was available or was persuaded by Bruno Maag to start over. Bruno may not create the most memorable typefaces, but he certainly knows how to sell them. And technically, their fonts are excellent. Too bad they didn’t have the confidence to work with me on an update. Instead they’re throwing out ten years of brand recognition in favour of blandness.&lt;/p&gt;↫ Erik Spiekermann&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was pleasently surprised by just how nice the font looks when used as a general user interface font. It’s extremely legible at a variety of sizes, and has a ton of character without becoming gimmicky or overbearing. What originally started as mere curiosity has now become my UI font of choice on all my machines, finally displacing Inter after many years of uncontested service. Of course, all of this is deeply personal and 95% an issue of taste, but I wanted to write about it to see if I’m just entirely crazy, or if there’s some method to my madness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do note that I’m using high DPI displays, and KDE on Wayland, and that all of this may look different on Windows or macOS, or on displays with lower DPI. One of Inter’s strengths is that it renders great on both high and lower DPI displays, but since I don’t have any lower DPI displays anymore, I can’t test it in such an environment. I’m also not entirely sure about the legal status of downloading fonts like this, but I am fairly sure you’re at least allowed to use non-free fonts for personal, non-commercial use, but please don’t quote me on that. Since downloading each variant of these Nokia fonts is annoying, I’d love to create and upload a zip file containing all of them, but I’m sure that’s illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not a font connoisseur, so I may be committing a huge faux pas here? Not that I care, but reading about font nerds losing their minds over things I never even noticed is always highly entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Physical limits of NIC, 10M CC, 5M RPS, 1M CPS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kernel bypass, lockless, no scheduling, no interruption&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easy adaption for any application&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of NIC, the poor performance of data packets processing with Linux kernel has become the bottleneck. However, the rapid development of the Internet needs high performance of network processing, kernel bypass has caught more and more attention. There are various similar technologies appear, such as DPDK, NETMAP and PF_RING. The main idea of kernel bypass is that Linux is only used to deal with control flow, all data streams are processed in user space. Therefore, kernel bypass can avoid performance bottlenecks caused by kernel packet copy, thread scheduling, system calls and interrupt. Furthermore, kernel bypass can achieve higher performance with multi optimizing methods. Within various techniques, DPDK has been widely used because of its more thorough isolation from kernel scheduling and active community support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;F-Stack is an open source network framework with high performance based on DPDKï¼ include an user space TCP/IP stack(port FreeBSD 11.0 stable), Posix API(Socket, Epoll, Kqueue), Progamming SDK(Coroutine) and some apps(Nginx, Redis) interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, there are various products in Tencent Cloud has used the F-Stack, such as DKDNS(DNSPod's authorization DNS server), HttpDNS (D+), COS access module, CDN access module, etc..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let's start using F-Stack to launch a HTTP server on EC2 with Nginx.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Agent Client Protocol standardizes communication between code editors (IDEs, text-editors, etc.) and coding agents (programs that use generative AI to autonomously modify code).The protocol is still under development, but it should be complete enough to build interesting user experiences using it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI coding agents and editors are tightly coupled but interoperability isn’t the default. Each editor must build custom integrations for every agent they want to support, and agents must implement editor-specific APIs to reach users. This creates several problems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration overhead: Every new agent-editor combination requires custom work&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limited compatibility: Agents work with only a subset of available editors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developer lock-in: Choosing an agent often means accepting their available interfaces&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ACP solves this by providing a standardized protocol for agent-editor communication, similar to how the Language Server Protocol (LSP) standardized language server integration.Agents that implement ACP work with any compatible editor. Editors that support ACP gain access to the entire ecosystem of ACP-compatible agents. This decoupling allows both sides to innovate independently while giving developers the freedom to choose the best tools for their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ACP assumes that the user is primarily in their editor, and wants to reach out and use agents to assist them with specific tasks.Agents run as sub-processes of the code editor, and communicate using JSON-RPC over stdio. The protocol re-uses the JSON representations used in MCP where possible, but includes custom types for useful agentic coding UX elements, like displaying diffs.The default format for user-readable text is Markdown, which allows enough flexibility to represent rich formatting without requiring that the code editor is capable of rendering HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FBI cyber cop: Salt Typhoon pwned 'nearly every American'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Plus millions of other people across 80+ countries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China's Salt Typhoon cyberspies hoovered up information belonging to millions of people in the United States over the course of the years-long intrusion into telecommunications networks, according to a top FBI cyber official.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There's a good chance this espionage campaign has stolen information from nearly every American," Michael Machtinger, deputy assistant director for the FBI's cyber division, told The Register.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There's a thought among the public that if you don't work in a sensitive area that the PRC might be interested in for its traditional espionage activities, then you are safe, they will not target you," he said, during a Thursday interview with The Register. "As we have seen from Salt Typhoon, this is no longer an assumption that anyone can afford to make."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beijing-backed spying campaign began at least in 2019 but wasn't uncovered by US authorities until last fall. On Wednesday, US law enforcement and intelligence agencies along with those from 12 other countries warned the ongoing espionage activity expanded far beyond nine American telcos and government networks. According to Machtinger, at least 80 countries were hit by the digital intrusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 200 American organizations were compromised by the espionage activity, Machtinger said, including the previously disclosed telecommunications firms such as Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday's joint security alert also pointed the allies' collective finger at three China-based entities affiliated with Salt Typhoon: Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology, Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology, and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology. These companies, and likely others, provide cyber products and services to China's Ministry of State Security and People's Liberation Army, the governments said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What the PRC is doing through these proxy actors is really reckless and unbounded, in a way that is significantly outside of the norms of what we see in the espionage space&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This is one of the most consequential cyber espionage breaches that we've ever seen in the United States," Machtinger said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"What this really underscores is that what the PRC is doing through these proxy actors is really reckless and unbounded, in a way that is significantly outside of the norms of what we see in the espionage space," he added. "And that should really set off alarm bells for us — not only in the United States. The scale of indiscriminate targeting is unlike what we've seen in the past."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This indiscriminate targeting, as the FBI and White House security officials have previously noted, allowed Beijing’s snoops to geo-locate millions of mobile phone users, monitor their internet traffic, and, in some cases, record their phone calls. Victims reportedly included President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Machtinger declined to confirm whether Trump and Vance were among those surveilled, but did say that victims included more than 100 current and former presidential administration officials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"As we look at the impact on the different sets of victims," he said, Salt Typhoon collected "bulk information from millions of Americans."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the more targeted group of individuals, "most of whom are very high-profile, current and former presidential administration officials, and campaign appointees from both major political parties," the data collection went much deeper, Machtinger added. "Down to intercepting actual content."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you thought China's Salt Typhoon was booted off critical networks, think again&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;China's Salt Typhoon spies spotted on US govt networks before telcos, CISA boss says&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is the FBI, open up. China's Volt Typhoon is on your network&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How does China keep stealing our stuff, wonders DoD group responsible for keeping foreign agents out&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to Salt Typhoon, the feds over the past year have issued warnings about other Chinese cyber operations. These include Volt Typhoon intruders, who infected hundreds of outdated routers to build a botnet and break into US critical infrastructure facilities. The Beijing-backed crew, we would later learn, was prepositioning itself and readying destructive cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another China-linked crew, Silk Typhoon has spent more than a decade compromising IT and cloud providers to steal sensitive data from their government, technology, education, and legal and professional services customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is not the only source of threats, Machtinger noted. Russia, Iran, North Korea, plus along with home-grown and international cybercriminals and ransomware crooks, assault computers and networks of both individuals and organizations, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These actors are going to continue their efforts, and they're going to get more sophisticated," Machtinger said. "We need to make sure that we, a nation, are taking cybersecurity seriously, updating systems, removing end-of-life devices, and making it as hard and costly as possible for the myriad of actors that are out there to successfully compromise." ®&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readable version | Chinese translation | Korean translation | Turkish translation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a living document, last update: August 2025. Your contributions are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many buzzwords and best practices out there, but most of them have failed. We need something more fundamental, something that can't be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we feel confusion going through the code. Confusion costs time and money. Confusion is caused by high cognitive load. It's not some fancy abstract concept, but rather a fundamental human constraint. It's not imagined, it's there and we can feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we spend far more time reading and understanding code than writing it, we should constantly ask ourselves whether we are embedding excessive cognitive load into our code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive load is how much a developer needs to think in order to complete a task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When reading code, you put things like values of variables, control flow logic and call sequences into your head. The average person can hold roughly four such chunks in working memory. Once the cognitive load reaches this threshold, it becomes much harder to understand things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's say we have been asked to make some fixes to a completely unfamiliar project. We were told that a really smart developer had contributed to it. Lots of cool architectures, fancy libraries and trendy technologies were used. In other words, the author had created a high cognitive load for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should reduce the cognitive load in our projects as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic - caused by the inherent difficulty of a task. It can't be reduced, it's at the very heart of software development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraneous - created by the way the information is presented. Caused by factors not directly relevant to the task, such as smart author's quirks. Can be greatly reduced. We will focus on this type of cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's jump straight to the concrete practical examples of extraneous cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will refer to the level cognitive load as follows:&lt;code&gt;🧠&lt;/code&gt;: fresh working memory, zero cognitive load&lt;code&gt;🧠++&lt;/code&gt;: two facts in our working memory, cognitive load increased&lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;: cognitive overload, more than 4 facts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brain is much more complex and unexplored, but we can go with this simplistic model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;if val &amp;gt; someConstant // 🧠+
    &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (condition2 || condition3) // 🧠+++, prev cond should be true, one of c2 or c3 has be true
    &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (condition4 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !condition5) { // 🤯, we are messed up by this point
    ...
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduce intermediate variables with meaningful names:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;isValid = val &amp;gt; someConstant
isAllowed = condition2 || condition3
isSecure = condition4 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !condition5 
// 🧠, we don't need to remember the conditions, there are descriptive variables
if isValid &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isAllowed &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isSecure {
    ...
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;if isValid { // 🧠+, okay nested code applies to valid input only
    if isSecure { // 🧠++, we do stuff for valid and secure input only
        stuff // 🧠+++
    }
} &lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare it with the early returns:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if !isValid
    return
 
if !isSecure
    return

// 🧠, we don't really care about earlier returns, if we are here then all good

stuff // 🧠+&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can focus on the happy path only, thus freeing our working memory from all sorts of preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are asked to change a few things for our admin users: &lt;code&gt;🧠&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AdminController extends UserController extends GuestController extends BaseController&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohh, part of the functionality is in &lt;code&gt;BaseController&lt;/code&gt;, let's have a look: &lt;code&gt;🧠+&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Basic role mechanics got introduced in &lt;code&gt;GuestController&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;🧠++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Things got partially altered in &lt;code&gt;UserController&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;🧠+++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Finally we are here, &lt;code&gt;AdminController&lt;/code&gt;, let's code stuff! &lt;code&gt;🧠++++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait, there's &lt;code&gt;SuperuserController&lt;/code&gt; which extends &lt;code&gt;AdminController&lt;/code&gt;. By modifying &lt;code&gt;AdminController&lt;/code&gt; we can break things in the inherited class, so let's dive in &lt;code&gt;SuperuserController&lt;/code&gt; first: &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prefer composition over inheritance. We won't go into detail - there's plenty of material out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method, class and module are interchangeable in this context&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mantras like "methods should be shorter than 15 lines of code" or "classes should be small" turned out to be somewhat wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep module - simple interface, complex functionality&lt;lb/&gt; Shallow module - interface is relatively complex to the small functionality it provides&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having too many shallow modules can make it difficult to understand the project. Not only do we have to keep in mind each module responsibilities, but also all their interactions. To understand the purpose of a shallow module, we first need to look at the functionality of all the related modules. Jumping between such shallow components is mentally exhausting, linear thinking is more natural to us humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information hiding is paramount, and we don't hide as much complexity in shallow modules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have two pet projects, both of them are somewhat 5K lines of code. The first one has 80 shallow classes, whereas the second one has only 7 deep classes. I haven't been maintaining any of these projects for one year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I came back, I realised that it was extremely difficult to untangle all the interactions between those 80 classes in the first project. I would have to rebuild an enormous amount of cognitive load before I could start coding. On the other hand, I was able to grasp the second project quickly, because it had only a few deep classes with a simple interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best components are those that provide powerful functionality yet have a simple interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;John K. Ousterhout&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interface of the UNIX I/O is very simple. It has only five basic calls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;open(path, flags, permissions)
read(fd, buffer, count)
write(fd, buffer, count)
lseek(fd, offset, referencePosition)
close(fd)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modern implementation of this interface has hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Lots of complexity is hidden under the hood. Yet it is easy to use due to its simple interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deep module example is taken from the book A Philosophy of Software Design by John K. Ousterhout. Not only does this book cover the very essence of complexity in software development, but it also has the greatest interpretation of Parnas' influential paper On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules. Both are essential reads. Other related readings: A Philosophy of Software Design vs Clean Code, It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code, Small Functions considered Harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you think we are rooting for bloated God objects with too many responsibilities, you got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often, we end up creating lots of shallow modules, following some vague "a module should be responsible for one, and only one, thing" principle. What is this blurry one thing? Instantiating an object is one thing, right? So MetricsProviderFactoryFactory seems to be just fine. The names and interfaces of such classes tend to be more mentally taxing than their entire implementations, what kind of abstraction is that? Something went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make changes to our systems to satisfy our users and stakeholders. We are responsible to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A module should be responsible to one, and only one, user or stakeholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what this Single Responsibility Principle is all about. Simply put, if we introduce a bug in one place, and then two different business people come to complain, we've violated the principle. It has nothing to do with the number of things we do in our module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even now, this rule can do more harm than good. This principle can be understood in as many different ways as there are individuals. A better approach would be to look at how much cognitive load it all creates. It's mentally demanding to remember that change in one place can trigger a chain of reactions across different business streams. And that's about it, no fancy terms to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shallow-deep module principle is scale-agnostic, and we can apply it to microservices architecture. Too many shallow microservices won't do any good - the industry is heading towards somewhat "macroservices", i.e., services that are not so shallow (=deep). One of the worst and hardest to fix phenomena is so-called distributed monolith, which is often the result of this overly granular shallow separation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once consulted a startup where a team of five developers introduced 17(!) microservices. They were 10 months behind schedule and appeared nowhere close to the public release. Every new requirement led to changes in 4+ microservices. Diagnostic difficulty in integration space skyrocketed. Both time to market and cognitive load were unacceptably high. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this the right way to approach the uncertainty of a new system? It's enormously difficult to elicit the right logical boundaries in the beginning. The key is to make decisions as late as you can responsibly wait, because that is when you have the most information at hand. By introducing a network layer up front, we make our design decisions hard to revert right from the start. The team's only justification was: "The FAANG companies proved microservices architecture to be effective". Hello, you got to stop dreaming big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate argued that Linux's monolithic design was flawed and obsolete, and that a microkernel architecture should be used instead. Indeed, the microkernel design seemed to be superior "from a theoretical and aesthetical" point of view. On the practical side of things - three decades on, microkernel-based GNU Hurd is still in development, and monolithic Linux is everywhere. This page is powered by Linux, your smart teapot is powered by Linux. By monolithic Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-crafted monolith with truly isolated modules is often much more flexible than a bunch of microservices. It also requires far less cognitive effort to maintain. It's only when the need for separate deployments becomes crucial, such as scaling the development team, that you should consider adding a network layer between the modules, future microservices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We feel excited when new features got released in our favourite language. We spend some time learning these features, we build code upon them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there are lots of features, we may spend half an hour playing with a few lines of code, to use one or another feature. And it's kind of a waste of time. But what's worse, when you come back later, you would have to recreate that thought process!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You not only have to understand this complicated program, you have to understand why a programmer decided this was the way to approach a problem from the features that are available. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statements are made by none other than Rob Pike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce cognitive load by limiting the number of choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language features are OK, as long as they are orthogonal to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;Thoughts from an engineer with 20 years of C++ experience ⭐️&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was looking at my RSS reader the other day and noticed that I have somewhat three hundred unread articles under the "C++" tag. I haven't read a single article about the language since last summer, and I feel great!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been using C++ for 20 years for now, that's almost two-thirds of my life. Most of my experience lies in dealing with the darkest corners of the language (such as undefined behaviours of all sorts). It's not a reusable experience, and it's kind of creepy to throw it all away now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like, can you imagine, the token&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; has a different meaning in &lt;code&gt;requires ((!P&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; || !Q&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;))&lt;/code&gt; and in &lt;code&gt;requires (!(P&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; || Q&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;))&lt;/code&gt;. The first is the constraint disjunction, the second is the good-old logical OR operator, and they behave differently.&lt;p&gt;You can't allocate space for a trivial type and just&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt; a set of bytes there without extra effort - that won't start the lifetime of an object. This was the case before C++20. It was fixed in C++20, but the cognitive load of the language has only increased.&lt;p&gt;Cognitive load is constantly growing, even though things got fixed. I should know what was fixed, when it was fixed, and what it was like before. I am a professional after all. Sure, C++ is good at legacy support, which also means that you will face that legacy. For example, last month a colleague of mine asked me about some behaviour in C++03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 20 ways of initialization. Uniform initialization syntax has been added. Now we have 21 ways of initialization. By the way, does anyone remember the rules for selecting constructors from the initializer list? Something about implicit conversion with the least loss of information, but if the value is known statically, then...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increased cognitive load is not caused by a business task at hand. It is not an intrinsic complexity of the domain. It is just there due to historical reasons (extraneous cognitive load).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to come up with some rules. Like, if that line of code is not as obvious and I have to remember the standard, I better not write it that way. The standard is somewhat 1500 pages long, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By no means I am trying to blame C++. I love the language. It's just that I am tired now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to 0xd34df00d for writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the backend we return:&lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt; for expired jwt token&lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt; for not enough access&lt;code&gt;418&lt;/code&gt; for banned users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineers on the frontend use backend API to implement login functionality. They would have to temporarily create the following cognitive load in their brains:&lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt; is for expired jwt token // &lt;code&gt;🧠+&lt;/code&gt;, ok just temporary remember it&lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt; is for not enough access // &lt;code&gt;🧠++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;418&lt;/code&gt; is for banned users // &lt;code&gt;🧠+++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontend developers would (hopefully) introduce some kind &lt;code&gt;numeric status -&amp;gt; meaning&lt;/code&gt; dictionary on their side, so that subsequent generations of contributors wouldn't have to recreate this mapping in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then QA engineers come into play: "Hey, I got &lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt; status, is that expired token or not enough access?"
QA engineers can't jump straight to testing, because first they have to recreate the cognitive load that the engineers on the backend once created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why hold this custom mapping in our working memory? It's better to abstract away your business details from the HTTP transfer protocol, and return self-descriptive codes directly in the response body:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "code": "jwt_has_expired"
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive load on the frontend side: &lt;code&gt;🧠&lt;/code&gt; (fresh, no facts are held in mind)&lt;lb/&gt; Cognitive load on the QA side: &lt;code&gt;🧠&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same rule applies to all sorts of numeric statuses (in the database or wherever) - prefer self-describing strings. We are not in the era of 640K computers to optimise for memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People spend time arguing between&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt;, making decisions based on their own mental models. New developers are coming in, and they need to recreate that thought process. You may have documented the "whys" (ADRs) for your code, helping newcomers to understand the decisions made. But in the end it just doesn't make any sense. We can separate errors into either user-related or server-related, but apart from that, things are kind of blurry.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S. It's often mentally taxing to distinguish between "authentication" and "authorization". We can use simpler terms like "login" and "permissions" to reduce the cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not repeat yourself - that is one of the first principles you are taught as a software engineer. It is so deeply embedded in ourselves that we can not stand the fact of a few extra lines of code. Although in general a good and fundamental rule, when overused it leads to the cognitive load we can not handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, everyone builds software based on logically separated components. Often those are distributed among multiple codebases representing separate services. When you strive to eliminate any repetition, you might end up creating tight coupling between unrelated components. As a result changes in one part may have unintended consequences in other seemingly unrelated areas. It can also hinder the ability to replace or modify individual components without impacting the entire system. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the same problem arises even within a single module. You might extract common functionality too early, based on perceived similarities that might not actually exist in the long run. This can result in unnecessary abstractions that are difficult to modify or extend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Pike once said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little copying is better than a little dependency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are tempted to not reinvent the wheel so strong that we are ready to import large, heavy libraries to use a small function that we could easily write by ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All your dependencies are your code. Going through 10+ levels of stack trace of some imported library and figuring out what went wrong (because things go wrong) is painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of "magic" in frameworks. By relying too heavily on a framework, we force all upcoming developers to learn that "magic" first. It can take months. Even though frameworks enable us to launch MVPs in a matter of days, in the long run they tend to add unnecessary complexity and cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, at some point frameworks can become a significant constraint when faced with a new requirement that just doesn't fit the architecture. From here onwards people end up forking a framework and maintaining their own custom version. Imagine the amount of cognitive load a newcomer would have to build (i.e. learn this custom framework) in order to deliver any value. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By no means do we advocate to invent everything from scratch!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can write code in a somewhat framework-agnostic way. The business logic should not reside within a framework; rather, it should use the framework's components. Put a framework outside of your core logic. Use the framework in a library-like fashion. This would allow new contributors to add value from day one, without the need of going through debris of framework-related complexity first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a certain engineering excitement about all this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I myself was a passionate advocate of Hexagonal/Onion Architecture for years. I used it here and there and encouraged other teams to do so. The complexity of our projects went up, the sheer number of files alone had doubled. It felt like we were writing a lot of glue code. On ever changing requirements we had to make changes across multiple layers of abstractions, it all became tedious. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstraction is supposed to hide complexity, here it just adds indirection. Jumping from call to call to read along and figure out what goes wrong and what is missing is a vital requirement to quickly solve a problem. With this architecture’s layer uncoupling it requires an exponential factor of extra, often disjointed, traces to get to the point where the failure occurs. Every such trace takes space in our limited working memory. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This architecture was something that made intuitive sense at first, but every time we tried applying it to projects it made a lot more harm than good. In the end, we gave it all up in favour of the good old dependency inversion principle. No port/adapter terms to learn, no unnecessary layers of horizontal abstractions, no extraneous cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think that such layering will allow you to quickly replace a database or other dependencies, you're mistaken. Changing the storage causes lots of problems, and believe us, having some abstractions for the data access layer is the least of your worries. At best, abstractions can save somewhat 10% of your migration time (if any), the real pain is in data model incompatibilities, communication protocols, distributed systems challenges, and implicit interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a sufficient number of users of an API,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;it does not matter what you promise in the contract:&lt;lb/&gt;all observable behaviors of your system&lt;lb/&gt;will be depended on by somebody.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did a storage migration, and that took us about 10 months. The old system was single-threaded, so the exposed events were sequential. All our systems depended on that observed behaviour. This behavior was not part of the API contract, it was not reflected in the code. A new distributed storage didn't have that guarantee - the events came out-of-order. We spent only a few hours coding a new storage adapter, thanks to an abstraction. We spent the next 10 months on dealing with out-of-order events and other challenges. It's now funny to say that abstractions helps us replace components quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why pay the price of high cognitive load for such a layered architecture, if it doesn't pay off in the future? Plus, in most cases, that future of replacing some core component never happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These architectures are not fundamental, they are just subjective, biased consequences of more fundamental principles. Why rely on those subjective interpretations? Follow the fundamental rules instead: dependency inversion principle, single source of truth, cognitive load and information hiding. Your business logic should not depend on low-level modules like database, UI or framework. We should be able to write tests for our core logic without worrying about the infrastructure, and that's it. Discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not add layers of abstractions for the sake of an architecture. Add them whenever you need an extension point that is justified for practical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layers of abstraction aren't free of charge, they are to be held in our limited working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domain-driven design has some great points, although it is often misinterpreted. People say "We write code in DDD", which is a bit strange, because DDD is about problem space, not about solution space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitous language, domain, bounded context, aggregate, event storming are all about problem space. They are meant to help us learn the insights about the domain and extract the boundaries. DDD enables developers, domain experts and business people to communicate effectively using a single, unified language. Rather than focusing on these problem space aspects of DDD, we tend to emphasise particular folder structures, services, repositories, and other solution space techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are that the way we interpret DDD is likely to be unique and subjective. And if we build code upon this understanding, i.e., if we create a lot of extraneous cognitive load - future developers are doomed. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Topologies provides a much better, easier to understand framework that helps us split the cognitive load across teams. Engineers tend to develop somewhat similar mental models after learning about Team Topologies. DDD, on the other hand, seems to be creating 10 different mental models for 10 different readers. Instead of being common ground, it becomes a battleground for unnecessary debates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that familiarity is not the same as simplicity. They feel the same — that same ease of moving through a space without much mental effort — but for very different reasons. Every “clever” (read: “self-indulgent”) and non-idiomatic trick you use incurs a learning penalty for everyone else. Once they have done that learning, then they will find working with the code less difficult. So it is hard to recognise how to simplify code that you are already familiar with. This is why I try to get “the new kid” to critique the code before they get too institutionalised!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the previous author(s) created this huge mess one tiny increment at a time, not all at once. So you are the first person who has ever had to try to make sense of it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my class I describe a sprawling SQL stored procedure we were looking at one day, with hundreds of lines of conditionals in a huge WHERE clause. Someone asked how anyone could have let it get this bad. I told them: “When there are only 2 or 3 conditionals, adding another one doesn’t make any difference. By the time there are 20 or 30 conditionals, adding another one doesn’t make any difference!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no “simplifying force” acting on the code base other than deliberate choices that you make. Simplifying takes effort, and people are too often in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Dan North for his comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've internalized the mental models of the project into your long-term memory, you won't experience a high cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more mental models there are to learn, the longer it takes for a new developer to deliver value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you onboard new people on your project, try to measure the amount of confusion they have (pair programming may help). If they're confused for more than ~40 minutes in a row - you've got things to improve in your code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you keep the cognitive load low, people can contribute to your codebase within the first few hours of joining your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;How Instagram scaled to 14 million users with only 3 engineers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The companies where we were like ”woah, these folks are smart as hell” for the most part failed&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;One function that wires up the entire system. If you want to know how the system works - go read it&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;These architectures are quite boring and easy to understand. Anyone can grasp them without much mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involve junior developers in architecture reviews. They will help you to identify the mentally demanding areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine for a moment that what we inferred in the second chapter isn’t actually true. If that’s the case, then the conclusion we just negated, along with the conclusions in the previous chapter that we had accepted as valid, might not be correct either. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel it? Not only do you have to jump all over the article to get the meaning (shallow modules!), but the paragraph in general is difficult to understand. We have just created an unnecessary cognitive load in your head. Do not do this to your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should reduce any cognitive load above and beyond what is intrinsic to the work we do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;Comments&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Pike&lt;lb/&gt;Nice article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy (ChatGPT, Tesla)&lt;lb/&gt;Nice post on software engineering. Probably the most true, least practiced viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk&lt;lb/&gt;True.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addy Osmani (Chrome, the most complex software system in the world)&lt;lb/&gt;I've seen countless projects where smart developers created impressive architectures using the latest design patterns and microservices. But when new team members tried to make changes, they spent weeks just trying to understand how everything fits together. The cognitive load was so high that productivity plummeted and bugs multiplied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony? Many of these complexity-inducing patterns were implemented in the name of "clean code."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really matters is reducing unnecessary cognitive burden. Sometimes this means fewer, deeper modules instead of many shallow ones. Sometimes it means keeping related logic together instead of splitting it into tiny functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it means choosing boring, straightforward solutions over clever ones. The best code isn't the most elegant or sophisticated - it's the code that future developers (including yourself) can understand quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your article really resonates with the challenges we face in browser development. You're absolutely right about modern browsers being among the most complex software systems. Managing that complexity in Chromium is a constant challenge that aligns perfectly with many of the points you made about cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way we try to handle this in Chromium is through careful component isolation and well-defined interfaces between subsystems (like rendering, networking, JavaScript execution, etc.). Similar to your deep modules example with Unix I/O - we aim for powerful functionality behind relatively simple interfaces. For instance, our rendering pipeline handles incredible complexity (layout, compositing, GPU acceleration) but developers can interact with it through clear abstraction layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your points about avoiding unnecessary abstractions really hit home too. In browser development, we constantly balance between making the codebase approachable for new contributors while handling the inherent complexity of web standards and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one, even in a complex system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;antirez (Redis)&lt;lb/&gt;Totally agree about it :) Also, what I believe is missing from mentioned "A Philosophy of Software Design" is the concept of "design sacrifice". That is, sometimes you sacrifice something and get back simplicity, or performances, or both. I apply this idea continuously, but often is not understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good example is the fact that I always refused to have hash items expires. This is a design sacrifice because if you have certain attributes only in the top-level items (the keys themselves), the design is simpler, values will just be objects. When Redis got hash expires, it was a nice feature but required (indeed) many changes to many parts, raising the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example is what I'm doing right now, Vector Sets, the new Redis data type. I decided that Redis would not be the source of truth about vectors, but that it can just take an approximate version of them, so I was able to do on-insert normalization, quantization without trying to retain the large floats vector on disk, and so forth. May vector DBs don't sacrifice the fact of remembering what the user put inside (the full precision vector).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just two random examples, but I apply this idea everywhere. Now the thing is: of course one must sacrifice the right things. Often, there are 5% features that account for a very large amount of complexity: that is a good thing to kill :D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A developer from the internet&lt;lb/&gt;You would not hire me... I sell myself on my track record of released enterprise projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked with a guy that could speak design patterns. I could never speak that way, though I was one of the few that could well understand him. The managers loved him and he could dominate any development conversation. The people working around him said he left a trail of destruction behind him. I was told that I was the first person that could understand his projects. Maintainability matters. I care most about TCO. For some firms, that's what matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I logged into Github after not being there for a while and for some reason it took me to an article in a repository by someone that seemed random. I was thinking "what is this" and had some trouble getting to my home page, so I read it. I didn't really register it at the time, but it was amazing. Every developer should read it. It largely said that almost everything we've been told about programming best practices leads to excessive "cognitive load", meaning our minds are getting kicked by the intellectual demands. I've known this for a while, especially with the demands of cloud, security and DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also liked it because it described practices I have done for decades, but never much admit to because they are not popular... I write really complicated stuff and need all the help I can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider, if I'm right, it popped up because the Github folks, very smart people, though that developers should see it. I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bcachefs goes to "externally maintained"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Posted Aug 29, 2025 17:30 UTC (Fri) by intelfx (subscriber, #130118) [Link] (10 responses) &amp;gt; This change also suggests, though, that the immediate removal of bcachefs from the mainline kernel is not in the cards. How would that work? If further changes are not accepted into mainline, but fs/bcachefs/ is not being removed thereof, then what exactly happens to it (the physical code living under that path)? Is it going to slowly bit-rot, with users being instructed to ignore in-tree code and use some other tree instead? Posted Aug 29, 2025 17:42 UTC (Fri) by zdzichu (subscriber, #17118) [Link] (9 responses) Posted Aug 29, 2025 19:21 UTC (Fri) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link] (8 responses) But there are a number of unstated assumptions here. The most important problem is how this upstreaming process will work. I can think of a few different alternatives, but the most straightforward option is for Kent to designate somebody. That person would then be responsible for all interaction with the kernel process, including sending emails, responding to code reviews, changing the code as requested (or telling Kent to do so and relaying his responses), etc. This strikes me as a highly difficult and thankless job that I certainly would not want to do. You could easily end up recreating exactly the same argument that Kent was regularly getting into (over release schedules, merge windows, etc.), but by proxy instead of directly. Ideally, Kent stops caring about the kernel's release processes altogether, and takes a mindset of "the kernel is [designee's] problem, and I don't have to deal with it aside from applying a few patches every now and then." Most of the alternatives are worse. If we instead suppose that the kernel takes bcachefs code without Kent's explicit approval or involvement, then the kernel upstream is a de facto fork of bcachefs (or they're just mirroring him, but there are governance problems with that). I'm not convinced that Linus et al. want to maintain a fork in this situation. Posted Aug 29, 2025 22:11 UTC (Fri) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (7 responses) And release process is something I care deeply about, for the simple reason that I support my code. I respond to nearly all of the user bug reports and stare at the test dashboards; I want users to have the most stable and trustworthy code I can provide. Broken release process is exactly why bcachefs-tools isn't in Debian as well; the package maintainer who took it upon himself to package bcachefs-tools in Debian put project rules ahead of shipping working code, then broke the build and sat in it - and I got stuck with the bug reports. So I'm equally curious where we go from here, I'm no more in the loop than anyone else. Exciting times, as the Chinese proverb says. Posted Aug 30, 2025 4:57 UTC (Sat) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link] (1 responses) The distros are downstreams. If they want to package and ship your code, in whatever way they see fit, you've already given them permission to do so. And they are not shy about exercising that permission. I remember several years ago, jwz asked Debian to stop shipping XScreenSaver, because he disagreed with their practice of backporting fixes to old versions. Debian said no, and XScreenSaver is still in the repository today. As you might imagine, some rather harsh words were exchanged, but in the end, both sides went back to their respective corners of the internet and proceeded to mostly ignore each other. Linus, however, is not in the business of playing that game. If there's nobody actively maintaining (his copy of) bcachefs, then I find it hard to believe it's going to be allowed to stick around indefinitely. &amp;gt; So I'm equally curious where we go from here, I'm no more in the loop than anyone else. Exciting times, as the Chinese proverb says. My interpretation of events is that there are only three long-term paths that make sense here: * You accept that you cannot control what appears in Linus's tree, but would prefer that some recent-ish version of bcachefs is there (as opposed to no bcachefs or a very old bcachefs). You designate somebody as I've described upthread, they upstream patches at whatever rate Linus is willing to take them, and everybody is more or less willing to live with the result. I do not see any plausible outcome where you are allowed to control what appears in Linus's tree. He has very explicitly closed the door on that. For expository purposes, and because you are a functioning adult, I have assumed that you will accept this lack of control, but that does not actually matter - one of the above scenarios will inevitably play out, regardless of your opinion of it. The only choice you have at this point is whether it's the first bullet or one of the other two. I do not say this to be cruel. Based on your words in this and other threads, I genuinely believe that this process has been very painful for you, and I doubt you enjoy being reminded that Linus's tree does, in fact, belong to Linus (I'm sure other developers have screamed that at you enough times by now). Unfortunately, this is not a matter of right or wrong. It is a matter of power. You are aggrieved about something that neither Linus, nor anybody else on LKML, is prepared to recognize as an injury to you. Regardless of whether that is the right way or the wrong way of looking at it, Linus is going to conduct the kernel's release cycle as he sees fit. The *healthy* way of looking at it is to accept that that is not within your power to change, and redirect your attention to the things you can change.

This is something you've done before, and you were very recently called out in lkml for it. Stop. To correct the record: bcachefs-tools is not in Debian because Kent was impossible to work with and personally attacked, smeared and/or alienated multiple sets of distinct contributors that attempted to work with him in good faith, one after another. It was ultimately removed from unstable because noone was able to get through. Source: I am one of them. Posted Aug 30, 2025 11:44 UTC (Sat) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (1 responses) He did so anyways, and then swapped out bindgen for an old version that was explicitly unsupported according to the Cargo.toml, which broke the build, and he sat on it and Debian users stopped getting updates (I didn't even see a report until months later). This resulted in users being unable to access their filesystems. There was briefly a buggy version of bcachefs-tools that couldn't pass mount options correctly; users in every other distro got a fix quickly, but Debian users did not - and we found out about this when a lot of users weren't able to mount in degraded mode after having a drive die. What you're doing is conflating technical criticism with personal, and then using that as an excuse to ramp up the drama. Technical criticism, including pointing out failures of processes, has to be ok for engineering to function, otherwise we don't learn from our mistakes. That can make for a harsh learning environment, but when you're shipping critical system components that have to work, that's what you signed up for; we have responsibilities. The person in question was warned explicitly that what he was doing was a bad idea; he could have at any point said "this is too complicated an issue for me to handle; I'll let someone else take this one" (and there are mechanisms in Debian process for obtaining exceptions to process rules that could have avoided this, by simply skipping the Rust dependency unbundling with a clear explanation of why); he ignored advice and plowed ahead, and a lot of people were affected by those actions. When we work on this kind of code, we have to be responsible for the work we do, including our mistakes. Posted Aug 30, 2025 14:25 UTC (Sat) by ma4ris8 (subscriber, #170509) [Link] Listen part: I'm trying to repeat roughly the same as you wrote above, to show that I listened you: First you state that maintainer switched Rust dependencies for the packaged versions from Debian. He changed Rust dependencies anyways, and then swapped out bindgen into older version, Important end question: Did I repeat (re-phrase in text) precisely what you wrote? Answer part: For me it sounds like there were some mistakes done by both you and others. How to communicate (listen) effectively, to heal relationships? This way of listening is mentioned in What I showed, is one way to restore human relationships, with Linus and others: If you get a backslash, you was just given an opportunity to listen the complaint. By doing this just very slightly to not burden others, I've seen that sometimes this listening technique helps on-line, in addition of meeting face to face. Posted Aug 30, 2025 12:24 UTC (Sat) by muase (subscriber, #178466) [Link] I know it's not the distros' fault; it's simply how LTS has to work in practice – however I can understand the frustration that arises if there seems to be an opportunity to finally update a package(set)... and then that opportunity is missed, and now the dev knows that they have to endure those obsolete bug reports for another n-year release cycle. It definitely didn't read as "just to attack someone". &amp;gt; To correct the record: bcachefs-tools is not in Debian because Kent was impossible to work with and personally attacked, smeared and/or alienated multiple sets of distinct contributors that attempted to work with him in good faith, one after another. Tbh, the only personal attack I see here is from you; and as an outsider, this is not very informative – your frustration may be absolutely legit, but this reply doesn't suit your case. If the communication is public, do you have a link or something? :) Posted Aug 30, 2025 17:12 UTC (Sat) by DemiMarie (subscriber, #164188) [Link] For anything that has to happen before the filesystem can be accessed at all, it might make sense to have an option for the userspace mount helper to do the work. In this case, the userspace helper has far fewer disadvantages I know of. My dream would be for bcachefs to have SQLite’s level of testing and input validation, or (even better) formal verification. Either would massively reduce the rate of bugs making it into a release, but neither is reasonable to ask for outside of a suitably-priced commercial engagement.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications using AI embed the AI model in a framework that interfaces between the model and the rest of the system, providing needed services such as tool calling, context retrieval, etc. Software for early chatbots took user input, called the LLM, and returned the result to the user; essentially just a read-eval-print loop. But, as the capabilities of LLMs have evolved and extension mechanisms, such as MCP were defined, the complexities of the control software that calls the LLM have increased. AI software systems require the same qualities that an operating system provides, including security, isolation, extensibility, and portability. For example, when an AI model needs to be given a file as part of its context, access control must be established that determines if the model should be allowed to view that file. We believe it is time to consider standardizing the ways in which the AI models are embedded into software and think of that control software layer as a virtual machine, where one of the machine instructions, albeit a super-powerful one, is to call the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our approach decouples model development from integration logic, allowing any model to “plug in” to a rich software ecosystem that includes tools, security controls, memory abstractions, etc. Similar to the impact that the Java Virtual Machine had, creating a specification of a VM for the AI orchestrator could enable a “write once, run anywhere” execution environment for AI models while at the same time providing familiar constraints and governance to maintain security and privacy in existing software systems. Below we outline related work in this direction, the motivation behind it, and the key benefits of an AI Model VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI models are being leveraged in existing software as application copilots, embedded in IDEs, and with the rise of the MCP protocol, are increasingly able to use tools, implement agents, etc. This rapid evolution of valuable use cases brings with it a greater need to ensure that the AI-powered applications maintain privacy, are secure, and operate correctly. Guarantees of security and privacy are best provided if the underlying system is secure by design and not added on to systems as an afterthought. We take the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as our inspiration in making the case for the importance of a standard AI Virtual Machine. The Java Virtual Machine guarantees memory safety by design, defines access control policies, and prevents code injection with bytecode verification. These properties allow Java programs running on the JVM to be executed with trust despite being shipped remotely, enabling “write once, run anywhere” software distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the JVM relate to applications that use AI models? We used the following example to explain:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The diagram illustrates the role of the software layer that interacts with an AI model, which we call the Model Virtual Machine (MVM). That layer intermediates between the model and the rest of the world. For example, a chatbot user might type a prompt (1) that the MVM then sends unmodified to the AI model (2). In practice, the MVM will add additional context, including the system prompt, chat history, to the AI model input as well. The AI model generates a response, which in the example requires a specific tool to be called (3). This response has a specific format that is mutually agreed upon between the model and the MVM, such as MCP. In our example, because it is important to restrict the model from making undesired tool calls, the MVM first consults the list of allowed tools (4) before deciding to call the tool the model requested (5). This check (4) guarantees that the model doesn’t make unauthorized tool calls. Every commercial system using AI models requires some version of this control software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We make the analogy that the interface with the LLM should be a virtual machine. If that is the case, what are the instructions that the machine can execute? Here are examples of operations that existing AI model interfaces have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certifying, loading, initializing, and unloading a given AI model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Calling a model with context&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parsing the output from the model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certifying, loading, initializing, and unloading tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Calling a tool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parsing the results from a tool call&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Storing the results from a tool call into memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Asking the user for input&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adding content to a history memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Standard control constructs such as conditionals, sequencing, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A VM would support all of these operations in a well-typed context where constraints are placed on the calls made, the arguments passed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing Work Informs What is Needed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the required elements of a well-specified interface are emerging in AI systems explored in academic work and in applications that are widely deployed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenAI’s Structured Tool Calling Protocols: OpenAI introduced a JSON-based function calling API that lets models invoke code-defined functions in a structured way. This approach, along with OpenAI’s plugin system (which uses OpenAPI specifications for tools), showed how structured tool-calling protocols can reduce ambiguity and simplify integration.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP, 2024): MCP is an open protocol for connecting AI assistants to external data and tools, explicitly aiming to be a universal interface. “Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications,” Anthropic explains. Instead of every service having a custom AI integration, MCP provides a common schema and client-server approach. Despite being relatively new, MCP adoption, including in large companies, has been rapid.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Secure Orchestrators – FIDES &amp;amp; AC4A (2025): Security remains a weak point in current AI systems. Two recent projects propose runtime-level controls. FIDES (by Microsoft Research) enforces information-flow policies on agents by tracking data confidentiality labels and adding new agent actions like “inspect” to limit what agents can access (where a quarantined LLM can safely summarize restricted data) (paper). AC4A (Access Control for Agents) (manuscript in preparation) takes an OS-style approach: All tools and data are organized into hierarchies (like files and folders), and the agent must request read/write access for each resource. AC4A’s runtime intercepts every agent action and blocks anything not permitted, forcing a least-privilege operation mode. These projects show how a standard AI VM could include built-in security and access control, just as modern operating systems do. Even with strong access controls built into a VM specification, AI models present new security challenges that need to be considered in the design. For example, an AI model, when prevented from accessing a particular item of data, might use its chain-of-thought reasoning to devise ways to gather accessible data that allows it to infer the inaccessible item. As such, security researchers have to devise new mitigations to prevent AI models taking adversarial actions even with the virtual machine constraints.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open-Source Agent Runtimes: Several projects are actively building general-purpose runtimes for AI. For example, langchain and Semantic Kernel provide numerous common runtime services that make writing reliable AI-enabled applications easier. The AI Controller Interface (AICI) (later renamed llguidance), integrates a lightweight VM into the model-serving pipeline, allowing developers to script and constrain model behavior at a low level (e.g., control of generations token-by-token).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defining a specification for a VM interface for AI systems from these emerging approaches will require more than an agreement on protocols and APIs. Because AI systems derive their behavior from training data, model training data must reflect the specification of the VM interface so that the models and the VM model interface can co-evolve. This will enable otherwise diverse models to exhibit broadly compatible behavior with respect to the VM interface specification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benefits of a Well-Specified AI Model VM&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned, many applications that leverage AI models require reliability, privacy, and security. In addition, new models are developed almost daily and updating the model being used by an application is often necessary. Given this confluence of factors, creating robust AI software presents significant engineering challenges. We believe that a specification of the interface between the AI model and the surrounding software that interfaces to it will address some of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The need for an AI Model VM specification is driven by several clear motivations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Separation of Concerns: An interface specification enforces a clean separation between model logic and integration logic. This means models become interchangeable components. You could swap in a new model (or move an agent to a different platform) and, as long as both adhere to the standard, everything still works. Likewise, virtual machine implementors can increase the performance, security, and tooling of the virtual machine while maintaining compatibility with the AI model interfaces.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built-in Safety and Governance: A VM specification can enforce safety by design. By routing all tool usage and external access through a well-defined interface, it becomes easier to apply permission checks, audit logs, and fail-safes. As shown by projects like AC4A, the VM can act as a gatekeeper, restricting what models can do unless explicitly authorized. This creates a safer deployment solution for powerful AI systems: even if the model behaves unpredictably, the VM layer can contain its effects. Standards bodies could even define security requirements (e.g., certain calls must always require user confirmation), creating a shared foundation of trust. Similar to the benefits of signed assemblies in the Common Language Runtime, have a certification process around loading and unloading models and tools ensures the end-to-end security of the supply chain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transparent Performance &amp;amp; Resource Tracking: A VM specification could also give developers visibility to runtime diagnostics. Post-execution manifests could report model performance, resource consumption, and data access level which helps developers evaluate overall efficiency and performance. Benchmarks for accuracy, utility, and responsiveness can be supported directly in the VM interface across models and platforms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verifiability of Model Output: Leveraging a VM specification, experts can explore integrating formal methods to verify their model behavior. Techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs could confirm the integrity of model outputs without sensitive internal logic. While still emerging, this possibility hints at new levels of trust and accountability in AI systems and should be carefully considered during development.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We argue that a well-specified AI Model Virtual Machine is needed. Developments occurring in multiple directions, including work from tech companies, startups, and academia, all motivate the need for a VM specification that lets AI models safely and seamlessly interact with the world around them. The motivation is clear – reducing complexity and unlocking interoperability – and the potential benefits range from technical (faster development, modular upgrades) to strategic (cross-platform AI ecosystems, improved safety). From enforcing controls for security and privacy, to potentially formal proof capabilities for trust, the opportunities are wide-ranging. Learning a lesson from older generations of software virtualization, a VM specification can increase AI systems portability, interoperability, security, and reliability. The purpose of this document is to highlight these issues and start engaging with the community on building a consensus that such a specification is needed and what it should include.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Condor Computing, a subsidiary of Andes Technology that creates licensable RISC-V cores, has a business model with parallels to Arm (the company) and SiFive. Andes formed Condor in 2023, so Condor is a relatively young player on the RISC-V scene. However, Andes does have RISC-V design experience prior to Condor’s formation with a few RISC-V cores under their belt from years past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Condor is presenting their Cuzco core at Hot Chips 2025. This core is a heavyweight within the RISC-V scene, with wide out-of-order execution and a modern branch predictor and some new time based tricks. It’s in the same segment as high performance RISC-V designs like SiFive’s P870 and Veyron’s V1. Like those cores, Cuzco should stand head and shoulders above currently in-silicon RISC-V cores like Alibaba T-HEAD’s C910 and SiFive’s P550.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides being a wide out-of-order design, Cuzco uses mostly static scheduling in the backend to save power and reduce complexity. Condor calls this a “time-based” scheduling scheme. I’ll cover more on this later, but it’s important to note that this is purely an implementation detail. It doesn’t require ISA modifications or special treatment from the compiler for optimal performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Core Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cuzco is a 8-wide out-of-order core with a 256 entry ROB and clock speed targets around 2 GHz SS (Slow-Slow) to 2.5 GHz (Typical-Typical) on TSMC’s 5nm process. The pipeline has 12 stages counting from instruction fetch to data cache access completion. However, a 10 cycle mispredict penalty probably more accurately describes the core’s pipeline length relative to its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a licensed core, Cuzco is meant to be highly configurable to widen its target market. The core is built from a variable number of execution slices. Customization options also include L2 TLB size, off-cluster bus widths, and L2/L3 capacity. Condor can also adjust the size of various internal core structures to meet customer performance requirements. Cuzco cores are arranged into clusters with up to eight cores. Clusters interface with the system via a CHI bus, so customers can bring their own network-on-chip (NoC) to hit higher core counts via multi-cluster setups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Frontend&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cuzco’s frontend starts with a sophisticated branch predictor, as is typical for modern cores targeting any reasonable performance level. Conditional branches are handled via a TAGE-SC-L predictor. TAGE stands for Tagged Geometric, a technique that uses multiple tables each handling a different history length. It seeks to efficiently use branch predictor storage by selecting the most appropriate history length for each branch, as opposed to older techniques that use a fixed history length. The SC (Statistical Corrector) part handles the small subset of branches where TAGE doesn’t work well, and can invert the prediction if it sees TAGE often getting things wrong under certain circumstances. Finally, L indicates a loop predictor. A loop predictor is simply a set of counters that come into play for branches that are taken a certain number of times, then not taken once. If the branch predictor detects such loop behavior, the loop predictor can let it avoid mispredicting on the last iteration of the loop. Basically, TAGE-SC-L is an augmented version of the basic TAGE predictor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD’s Zen 2, Ampere’s AmpereOne, and Qualcomm’s Oryon also use TAGE predictors of some sort, and achieve excellent branch prediction accuracy. AMD, Ampere, and Qualcomm also likely augment the basic TAGE prediction strategy in some way. How Cuzco’s TAGE predictor performs will depend on how large its history tables are, as well as how well the predictor is tuned (selection of index vs tag bits, history lengths, distribution of storage budget across TAGE tables, etc). For Cuzco’s part, they’ve disclosed that the TAGE predictor’s base component uses a 16K entry table of bimodal counters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Branch target caching on Cuzco is provided by a 8K entry branch target buffer (BTB) split into two levels. Condor’s slides show the BTB hit/miss occurring on the cycle after instruction cache access starts, so a taken branch likely creates a single pipeline bubble. Returns are predicted using a 32 entry return stack. Cuzco also has an indirect branch predictor, which is typical on modern CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cuzco’s instruction fetch logic feeds from a 64 KB 8-way set associative instruction cache, and speeds up address translations with a 64 entry fully associative TLB. The instruction fetch stages pull an entire 64B cacheline into the ICQ (instruction cache queue), and then pull instructions from that into an instruction queue (XIQ). The decoders feed from the XIQ, and can handle up to eight instructions per cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Rename and Allocate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of the action in Condor’s presentation relates to the rename and allocate stage, which acts as a bridge between the frontend and out-of-order backend. In most out-of-order cores, the renamer carries out register renaming and allocates resources in the backend. Then, the backend dynamically schedules instructions as their dependencies become available. Cuzco’s renamer goes a step further and predicts instruction schedules as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One parallel to this is Nvidia’s static scheduling in Kepler and subsequent GPU architectures. Both simplify scheduling by telling an instruction to execute a certain number of cycles in the future, rather than having hardware dynamically check for dependencies. But Nvidia does this in their compiler because GPU ISAs aren’t standardized. Cuzco still uses hardware to create dynamic schedules, but moves that job into the rename/allocate stage rather than the schedulers in the backend. Schedulers can be expensive structures in conventional out-of-order CPUs, because they have to check whether instructions are ready to execute every cycle. On Cuzco, the backend schedulers can simply wait a specified number of cycles, and then issue an instruction knowing the dependencies will be ready by then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To carry out time-based scheduling, Cuzco maintains a Time Resource Matrix (TRM), which tracks utilization of various resources like execution ports, functional units, and data buses for a certain number of cycles in the future. The TRM can look 256 cycles into the future, which keeps storage requirements under control. Because searching a 256 row matrix in hardware would be extremely expensive, Cuzco only looks for available resources in a small window after an instruction’s dependencies are predicted to be ready. Condor found searching a window of eight cycles provided a good tradeoff. Because the renamer can handle up to eight instructions, it at most has to access 64 rows in the TRM per cycle. If the renamer can’t find free resources in the search window, the instruction will be stalled at the ID2 stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another potential limitation is the TRM size, which could be a limitation for long latency instructions. However, the longest latency instructions tend to be loads that miss cache. Cuzco always assumes a L1D hit for TRM scheduling, and uses replay to handle L1D misses. That means stalls at ID2 from TRM size limitations should also be rare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to a hypothetical “greedy” setup, where the core is able to create a perfect schedule with execution resource limitations in mind, limiting the TRM search window decreases performance by a few percent. Condor notes that creating a core to match the “greedy” figure may not even be possible. A conventional out-of-order core wouldn’t have TRM-related restrictions, but may face difficulties creating an optimal schedule for other reasons. For example, a distributed scheduler may have several micro-ops become ready in one scheduling queue, and face “false” delays even though free execution units may be available on other scheduling queues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Static scheduling only works when instruction latencies are known ahead of time. Some instructions have variable latency, like loads that can miss caches or TLBs, encounter bank conflicts, or require store forwarding. As mentioned before, Cuzco uses instruction replay to handle variable latency instructions and the associated dynamic behavior. The renamer does take some measures to reduce replays, like checking to see if a load gets its address from the same register as a prior store. However, it doesn’t attempt to predict memory dependencies like Intel’s Core 2, and also doesn’t try to predict whether a load will miss cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Out-of-Order Backend&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of order execution in Cuzco is relatively simple, because the rename/allocate stage takes care of figuring out when instructions will execute. Each instruction is simply held within the schedulers until a specified number of cycles pass, after which it’s sent for execution. If the rename/allocate stage guesses wrong, replay gets handled via “poison” bits. The erroneously executed instruction’s result data is effectively marked as poisoned, and any instructions consuming that data will get re-executed. Replaying instructions costs power and wastes execution throughput, so replays should ideally be a rare event. 70.07 replays per 1000 instructions feels like a bit of a high figure, but likely isn’t a major problem because execution resources are rarely a limitation in an out-of-order core. Taking about 7% more execution resources may be an acceptable tradeoff, considering most modern chips rarely use their core width in a sustained fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Execution resources are grouped into slices, each of which have a pair of pipelines. A slice can execute all of the core’s supported RISC-V instructions, making it easy to scale execution resources by changing slice count. Each slice consists of a set of execution queues (XEQs), which hold micro-ops waiting for a functional unit. Cuzco has XEQs per functional unit, unlike conventional designs that tend to have a scheduling queue that feeds all functional units attached to an execution port. Four register read ports supply operands to the slice, and two write ports handle result writeback. Bus conflicts are handled by the TRM as well. A slice cannot execute more than two micro-ops per cycle, even doing so would not oversubscribe the register read ports. For example, a slice can’t issue an integer add, a branch, and a load in the same cycle even though that would only require four register inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XEQs are sized to match workload characteristics, much like tuning a distributed scheduler. While XEQ sizes can be set to match customer requirements, Condor was able to give some figures for a baseline configuration. ALUs get 16 entry queues, while branches and address generation units (LS) get 8 entry queues. XEQ sizes are adjustable in powers of two, from 2 to 32 entries. There’s generally a single cycle of latency for forwarding between slices. The core can be configured to do zero cycle cross-slice forwarding, but that would be quite difficult to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the vector side, Cuzco supports 256/512-bit VLENs via multiple micro-ops, which are distributed across the execution slices. Execution units are natively 64 bits wide. There’s one FMA unit per slice, so peak FP32 throughput is eight FMA operations per cycle, or 16 FLOPS when counting the add and multiply as separate operations. FP adds execute with 2 cycle latency, while FP multiplies and multiply-adds have four cycle latency. The two cycle FP add latency is nice to see, and matches recent cores like Neoverse N1 and Intel’s Golden Cove, albeit at much lower clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Load/Store&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cuzco’s load/store unit has a 64 entry load queue, a 64 entry store queue, and a 64 entry queue for data cache misses. Loads can leave the load queue after accessing the data cache, likely creating behavior similar to AMD’s Zen series where the out-of-order backend can have far more loads pending retirement than the documented load queue capacity would suggest. The core has four load/store pipelines in a four slice configuration, or one pipeline per slice. Maximum load bandwidth is 64B/cycle, achievable with vector loads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The L1D is physically indexed and physically addressed (PIPT), so address translation has to complete before L1D access.To speed up address translation, Cuzco has a 64 entry fully associative data TLB. The L2 TLB is 4-way set associative, and can have 1K, 2K, or 4K entries. Cuzco’s core private, unified L2 cache has configurable capacity as well. An example 2 MB L2 occupies 1.04 mm2 on TSMC 5nm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eight cores per cluster share a L3 cache, which is split into slices to handle bandwidth demands from multiple cores. Each slice can deliver 64B/cycle, and slice count matches core count. Thus Cuzco enjoys 64B/cycle of load bandwidth throughout the cache hierarchy, of course with the caveat that L3 bandwidth may be lower if accesses from different cores clash into the same slice. Cores and L3 slices within a cluster are linked by a crossbar. The L3 cache can run at up to core clock. Requests to the system head out through a 64B/cycle CHI interface. System topology beyond the cluster is up to the implementer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replays for cache misses are carried out by rescheduling the data consumer to a later time when data is predicted to be ready. Thus a L3 hit would cause a consuming instruction to be executed three times - once for the predicted L1D hit, once for the predicted L2 hit, and a final time for the L3 hit with the correct data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Final Words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High performance CPU design has settled down over the past couple decades, and converged on an out-of-order execution model. There’s no denying that out-of-order execution is difficult. Numerous alternatives have been tried through the years but didn’t have staying power. Intel’s Itanium sought to use an ISA-based approach, but failed to unseat the company’s own x86 cores that used out-of-order execution. Nvidia’s Denver tried to dynamically compile ARM instructions into microcode bundles, but that approach was not carried forward. All successful high performance designs today generally use the same out-of-order execution strategy, albeit with plenty of variation. That’s driven by the requirements of ISA compatibility, and the need to deliver high single threaded performance across a broad range of applications. Breaking from the mould is obviously fraught with peril.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Condor seeks to break from the mould, but does so deep in the core in a way that should be invisible to software a functional perspective, and mostly invisible from a performance perspective. The core runs RISC-V instructions and thus benefits from that software ecosystem, unlike Itanium. It doesn’t rely on a compiled microcode cache like Denver, so it doesn’t end up running in a degraded performance beyond what a typical OoO core would see when dealing with poor code locality. Finally, instruction replay effectively creates dynamic schedules and handles cache misses&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bobby Azarian is a cognitive neuroscientist, a science journalist and the author of the book “The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness and Cosmic Complexity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most depressing scientific idea that has ever been put forth is the infamous “heat death hypothesis.” It is a theory about the future of the universe based on the second law of thermodynamics, which in its most well-known form states that entropy, a complicated and confusing term commonly understood to simply mean “disorder,” tends to increase over time in a closed system. Therefore, if we consider that the universe is itself a closed system, the law seems to suggest that the cosmos is becoming increasingly disorganized. It has also been described by many as “winding down.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As such, the second law appears to hold a chilling prophecy for humanity in the very long term. Essentially, it would seem to imply that life is doomed — not just life on Earth, but life anywhere in the cosmos. Consciousness, creativity, love — all of these things are destined to disappear as the universe becomes increasingly disordered and dissolves into entropy. Life would merely be a transient statistical fluctuation, one that will fade away, along with all dreams of our existence having some kind of eternal meaning, purpose or permanence. This bleak idea is known as the “heat death hypothesis,” and the prophecy foretells a future where all pattern and organization has ceased to be. In this cosmological model, everything must come to an end. There is simply no possibility for continual existence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the gloomiest theory of all time may just be a speculative assumption based on a misunderstanding of the second law of thermodynamics. For one thing, the law may not be applicable to the universe as a whole, because the types of systems on which it has been empirically tested have well-defined boundaries. The expanding universe does not. Secondly, depending on how one interprets the second law, the inevitable increase in entropy may not correspond to an increase in cosmic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, some leading scientists are beginning to think that the cosmos is becoming increasingly complex and organized over time as a result of the laws of physics and the evolutionary dynamics that emerge from them. Seth Lloyd, Eric Chaisson and Freeman Dyson are among the well-known names who have questioned whether “disorder” is increasing in the cosmos. Outside of physics, complexity theorist Stuart Kauffman, neuroscientist Christof Koch and Google’s director of engineering Ray Kurzweil all believe that the universe is not destined to grow more disorganized forever, but more complex and rich with information. Many of them have a computational view of the universe, in which life plays a special role.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Paul Davies, a prolific author and a highly respected theoretical physicist, wrote: “We now see how it is possible for the universe to increase both organization and entropy at the same time. The optimistic and pessimistic arrows of time can coexist: The universe can display creative unidirectional progress even in the face of the second law.” In other words, if we understand the second law better, we can see that it does not actually prohibit the continual growth of complexity and order in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the cosmic narrative that the theoretical physicist and author Julian Barbour proposes in his new book “The Janus Point: A New Theory of Time,” which has received praise by some trusted names in the physics world, such as Martin Rees, Sean Carroll and Lee Smolin. Barbour believes that the second law — at least as it is popularly interpreted — does not apply to the universe as a whole, since it is always expanding due to the mysterious force known as dark energy. The old story of increasing cosmic disorder, Barbour concludes, may turn out to be the complete opposite of what is actually happening. Because the universe is not a bounded system, order can continue to increase indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barbour is not alone. David Deutsch, the father of quantum computation, has expressed a similar view in his bestselling mindbender “The Beginning of Infinity,” in which he argues that there are no fundamental limits to knowledge creation. This is a much stronger claim than Barbour’s, because it specifically suggests that life in the universe need not come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Life is a crucial part of the cosmic story because the growth of complexity and organization enters a new phase when biology emerges. Life is a special form of complexity: It has the ability to create more complexity and to maintain organization against the tendency toward disorder. In a universe expanding without limit, the ability of intelligent life to continually construct complex order may not be limited by the laws of thermodynamics in the way once imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story of continual complexification would seem to go against the second law, a rock-solid pillar of physics. Remember, though, that both the first and second laws of thermodynamics were conceived before we knew the universe was expanding. To understand if these laws are applicable to the universe as a whole — and not just systems inside the universe — we must briefly explore the history of thermodynamics and understand its relationship with the phenomenon we call life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Doom&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the two fields of thermodynamics — classical and statistical — there are subtly different versions of the second law. The former emerged about a half a century before the latter, and it was concerned with the flow of heat and energy. Statistical thermodynamics attempted to explain the findings of classical thermodynamics in terms of the behavior of ensembles of molecules and atoms, and it was more concerned with how configurations of particles evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could say that the original version of the second law, the classical version, was about the spreading out of energy, where the statistical version was more about ordered configurations of particles becoming more disordered. While the two versions are intimately related and in many instances become equivalent, they do not have the same cosmic implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ideas that would become the second law can be traced back to the work of the French engineer Sadi Carnot in the early 1800s. Carnot wanted to understand how to make steam engines more efficient by analyzing how they used energy. He recognized that heat would spontaneously flow from hotter to colder systems, but never in reverse. We all experience this phenomenon on a daily basis, whenever a hot bath or cup of coffee inevitably cools to room temperature as heat is lost to the surrounding air. Carnot pointed out that this flow of heat creates a motive force, which can be harnessed to power machines. Through a cycle of heating and cooling steam inside a chamber (known as a cylinder) with a movable wall on one side (known as a piston), you can create a force of motion that can power an engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Carnot astutely noticed about this process was that it couldn’t be made 100% efficient. This is the basis for the original second law of thermodynamics. The conversion of thermal energy into mechanical energy always involves the loss of some useful energy to the environment in the form of heat. Once this useful energy is dissipated, meaning it gets spread and lost to its surroundings, it can no longer be harnessed to do physical work. The lost energy still technically exists somewhere out there in the universe, but it can’t be extracted to do anything useful, like sustaining an engine or some other machine. Since life is a machine of sorts, this has implications for how long it can persist in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Carnot was an engineer, his insights were largely unknown or ignored by the physics community for decades, until two giants in the field — Lord Kelvin and Rudolph Clausius — explained their significance and relevance to the emerging science of thermodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new field proposed two major laws that, when put together, seem to have cosmic implications. The first law says that energy is conserved. That means it cannot be created or destroyed — implying that the total amount is fixed — though it can be transformed from one form to another. The second essentially says that there is “free energy” — or energy available to do work — but as that energy is used for mechanical work, some of it inevitably gets dissipated as it is converted into heat, a form of energy that is no longer useful. Once energy is dispersed in this way, it becomes impossible to be used to do mechanical work, like creating a force that could power a system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1852, Lord Kelvin wrote a paper with what is considered to be the first statement of the second law, which he described as a universal tendency toward the dissipation of mechanical energy. The term “entropy,” introduced by Clausius in 1865, was originally defined as a measure of the energy in a system that is no longer available for work. Entropy, then, referred to dissipated energy, not structural disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essentially, these discoveries suggested that a limited supply of free energy was always spreading out and dissipating, so there would come a time when no further mechanical work could be done, including the work required to sustain the biological machinery that we call “life.” One by one, the stars that supply the energy that powers biology would radiate away their usable energy, and life would cease to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sad story isn’t just local; all the stars throughout the cosmos will eventually burn out, causing any biosphere, anywhere, to degrade. Even if some form of life could develop the technology to explore the cosmos, eventually all useful energy in the universe would be converted into heat, leaving no energetic fuel for advanced forms of sentience to consume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least, that was the assumption in the second half of the 19th century. This scenario became known as the “heat death” of the universe, and it seemed to be the nail in the coffin for any optimistic cosmology that promised, or even allowed, eternal life and consciousness. For example, one of the most popular cosmological models of the time was put forth by the evolutionary theorist Herbert Spencer, a contemporary of Charles Darwin who was actually more famous than him during their time. Spencer believed that the flow of energy through the universe was organizing it. He argued that biological evolution was just part of a larger process of cosmic evolution, and that life and human civilization were the current products of a process of continual cosmic complexification, which would ultimately lead to a state of maximal complexity, integration and balance among all things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the prominent Irish physicist John Tyndall told Spencer about the heat death hypothesis in a letter in 1858,” Spencer wrote him back to say it left him “staggered”: “Indeed, not seeing my way out of the conclusion, I remember being out of spirits for some days afterwards. I still feel unsettled about the matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things got even gloomier when the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann put forward a new statistical interpretation of the second law in the latter half of the 19th century. That was when the idea that the universe is growing more disordered came into the picture. Boltzmann took the classical version of the second law — that useful energy inevitably dissipates — and tried to give it a statistical explanation on the level of molecules colliding and spreading out. He used one of the simplest models possible: a gas confined to a box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the evolution of a gas in a box explain the dissipation of useful energy? First, it should be understood that a gas is a collection of molecules moving around rapidly and chaotically, particles that Boltzmann assumed were like little billiard balls following fixed trajectories. Since the great Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell had recently shown that the kinetic energy of a molecule is determined by how fast it is moving, Boltzmann assumed the dissipation of usable energy described by Lord Kelvin was caused by pockets of excited molecular motion spreading out in space due to random collisions between neighboring molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if a pocket of highly excited gas molecules starts out in some orderly configuration — let’s say the molecules are bunched together in one corner of the box — over time, the ensemble of particles will evolve to become increasingly spread out, or “disordered.” When an ordered pocket of excited molecular motion exists, there is an energy gradient in the system and the potential to do some work, but as these molecules interact with their neighbors and that excited motion gets dispersed, the gradient disappears. This dissipation of molecular order and free energy continues until the gas approaches a state of maximum entropy and disorder known as thermodynamic equilibrium. Paradoxically, this state of “total disorder” looks like a uniform distribution of gas molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gas molecules spread out in this way due to a simple statistical reason: There are many more ways for the gas molecules to be arranged in a disordered mess than in some orderly configuration. In other words, an orderly arrangement of particles moving around randomly will naturally become more disorganized. Just like in pool, where the balls start off in an ordered formation but spread out and mix up as collisions occur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boltzmann, like Clausius and Kelvin before him, tried to apply his version of the second law to the entire universe — which, he assumed, must be a giant closed system of atoms and molecules bouncing around chaotically, not all that different from his gas in a box. According to his version of the second law of thermodynamics, the entire universe — as a system composed of atoms moving according to physical laws — must eventually tend toward a more disordered and random configuration, just like his box of gas molecules. To explain why there was so much complexity and order in the universe around him, he suggested that the universe must have started out in an extremely ordered state that had since evolved into what we see today, or that the ordered state of affairs we see in our neck of the cosmic woods was the result of a temporary statistical fluctuation away from the general trend toward disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, there were many problems with comparing Boltzmann’s gas-in-a-box model to the universe. The order-to-disorder transition only occurs when the particles in the system do not become statistically correlated with each other over time. Boltzmann’s H-theorem, which the idea of a natural tendency toward disorder is based on, assumes “molecular chaos.” But molecular and chemical forces often cause atoms and molecules to clump together into larger, more complex structures — meaning a gas evolving in a box is not an accurate representation of all the dynamics in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boltzmann’s model also ignored the influence of gravity, which is often described as an anti-entropic force due to its clumping effects on matter. Gravity’s effects on small objects like gas molecules are essentially so tiny that they are negligible for all practical purposes, meaning you can leave the force out of the model and still make accurate predictions about the state of the system. But at the scale of the universe, the effects of gravity become extremely important to the evolving structure of the system. Gravity is one factor driving the growth of order in the cosmos, and a good example of why the evolution of the universe looks very different from a gas spreading out in a box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the attractive force of gravity doesn’t explain the emergence of life, which has been defying Boltzmann’s tendency toward disorder for about four billion years. Not only does life represent the formation of complexity, it constructs more of it. What explains this paradox? How does the biosphere grow more complex and organized if there’s a tendency for organized systems to fall apart? If cosmic complexity is to grow continuously, the process would then seem to curiously depend on life, the only form of complexity that can create more organization and actively sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quantum physicist Erwin Schrodinger explained this paradox in his 1944 book “What is Life?”. What Schrödinger noticed was that instead of drifting toward thermodynamic equilibrium — which for life means a state of death and decay — biological organisms maintained their ordered living state by consuming free energy from the environment (which he called “negative entropy”). Boltzmann’s law of increasing disorder only applies to closed systems, and life on Earth is an open system. It is constantly receiving usable energy from the sun, which drives it away from thermodynamic equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, without a steady supply of incoming energy, equilibrium ensues and life perishes. But by feasting on the free energy in the environment, ordered systems can pay the physical price of staying organized and functional, just like burning more coal will allow a steam engine to continue to function. The cost is the dissipation of free energy and the production of thermal entropy, in the form of heat, which is constantly being released into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, the continual growth of complexity in the form of biological and technological organization — in other words, the biosphere and the layer of industry and technology that sits on top of it — does not violate the classical version of the second law of thermodynamics. Because the biosphere is an open system that is continually getting energy from the sun, it can continuously build and maintain order. Local reductions in configurational entropy (disorder) are paid for by the simultaneous increase in thermal entropy (heat) caused by life’s constant use of free energy. As long as free energy continues to be used and dispersed, the total amount of entropy in the universe increases, and the classical version of the second law remains intact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that the production of heat is not the same as the creation of structural disorder. Energy gets more dispersed as the universe organizes itself, and that is all the second law requires in this context. One could say that energetic disorder increases as structural order grows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this means is that the universe can grow increasingly organized through the spread of intelligent life, as long as it can find the free energy it needs to build and maintain the cosmic organization it constructs. Luckily, the universe offers a vast ocean of exploitable energy to beings that are intelligent enough to know how to extract it. In theory, a hyperintelligent civilization could spread through the cosmos, transforming all the matter in its midst into exotic forms of biological and computational machinery. This scenario might be hard to visualize, but it would not be very different from how life went from existing at just a single point on the Earth, not even visible with the naked eye, to covering the entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But how long could this go on for? The great science fiction writer Isaac Asimov called that “The Last Question” in a critically acclaimed short story about the fate of life in the universe. The story questions the prevailing view of the second law’s applicability to the entire universe, an assumption made by a series of characters in the story: “However it may be husbanded, however stretched out, the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase to the maximum.” Asimov’s skepticism may have been one of his most prescient insights. In his 1964 biographical sketch of Clausius, Asimov called the heat death hypothesis the “scientific analog of the Last Judgement” and notes that “its validity is less certain now than it was a century ago. Though the laws of thermodynamics stand as firmly as ever, cosmologists are far less certain that the laws, as deduced in this small segment of the universe, necessarily apply to the universe as a whole and there is a certain willingness to suspend judgment on the matter of the heat-death.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;The Expanse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, the Harvard cosmologist David Layzer pointed out that although the entropy of the universe will continue to increase in accord with the second law of thermodynamics — that is, an expanding intelligence will always be converting more free energy into thermal entropy — the maximum possible entropy of the expanding universe will presumably increase at a faster rate than the actual entropy increase, allowing for the continual growth of order and complexity. He called this an “entropy gap” — the difference between the universe’s actual entropy and its maximum possible entropy. As long as that gap exists, the universe will not be in thermodynamic equilibrium, and that means there will be energy gradients that life can extract work from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we know the universe is not just expanding, which Edwin Hubble confirmed in 1929, but that the expansion is accelerating at an increasing rate due to the mysterious force known as “dark energy,” the presence of which was theorized before the turn of the millennium. These developments give us reason to believe that the entropy gap will persist into the future, such that the universe may never come to the state of equilibrium predicted by the heat death hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his 2016 book “Humanity in a Creative Universe,” the complexity theorist Stuart Kauffman explained the significance of this: “[W]e do not have to worry about enough free energy. As the universe becomes larger, its maximum entropy increases faster than the loss of free energy by the second law, so there is always more than enough free energy to do work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But where does this seemingly unlimited free energy come from, if the first law of thermodynamics suggests that nature has a fixed and finite amount?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that first law of thermodynamics may also not apply to the universe as a whole, as was assumed, even though conservation of energy applies to systems within the universe. Challenges to our traditional notion of the first law are not uncommon in modern physics. For example, cosmic inflation theory — the leading cosmological model for how the universe became filled with all its energy and matter — proposes that during the early period of expansion, miniscule fractions of a second after the Big Bang, new matter and energy was being continuously created from nothing. In fact, the theory of cosmic inflation suggests more and more universes are being created, so in the totality of reality envisioned by this model, matter creation never ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only way cosmic inflation theory can coexist with the first law is if we divide all the energy in the world into two opposing categories of energy: positive and negative. The so-called “positive energy” associated with new matter is balanced out by the “negative energy” of the gravitational force associated with that matter. According to this model, the sum total of energy of the universe is zero. It may seem like a desperate attempt by cosmologists to salvage the first law, but it works out mathematically. For this reason, Alan Guth calls the universe “the ultimate free lunch.” In principle, new energy can be continuously created, as long as the ratio of positive to negative energy remains balanced. While the implications of this concept are foggy, it is clear that applying the first and second laws of thermodynamics to the cosmos as a whole can get very tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deutsch speculates over whether life could harness dark energy directly itself to power computation forever in his 2011 book “The Beginning of Infinity”: “Depending on what dark energy turns out to be, it may well be possible to harness it in the distant future, to provide energy for knowledge-creation to continue forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some physicists have since argued that in theory, it is possible that dark energy could be used as a power source. A conference paper published by the American Astronomical Society proposes that “simple machines could, in theory, extract local power from the gravitationally repulsive cosmological constant,” even if “the amount of energy that could be liberated in a local setting is many orders of magnitude too small to be useful or even detectable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever dark energy turns out to be, the cosmic expansion it is driving serves to keep the universe out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and a system not in equilibrium is a system that still has some energy and the capacity to do work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At his blog Preposterous Universe, Sean Carroll writes: “If there exists a maximal entropy (thermal equilibrium) state, and the universe is eternal, it’s hard to see why we aren’t in such an equilibrium state — and that would be static, not constantly evolving. This is why I personally believe that there is no such equilibrium state, and that the universe evolves because it can always evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there’s no inevitable equilibrium state, then there seems to be no reason to assume that an evolving intelligence must necessarily come to an end. In his 2006 book “Programming the Universe,” MIT’s Seth Lloyd speculates along these lines: “By scavenging farther and farther afield, our descendants will collect more and more matter and extract its energy. Some fraction of this energy will inevitability be wasted or lost in transmission. Some cosmological models allow the continued collection of energy ad infinitum, but others do not.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some cosmologists believe dark energy and the accelerating expansion will ultimately dilute the matter and energy in the universe to such a degree that life must come to an end, a popular new theory known as quintessence suggests that the accelerating expansion may begin to slow, creating even more uncertainty around any predictions for life’s future. Perhaps the dynamics of the universe’s expansion are what they need to be to allow for the continual growth of cosmic complexity? In a 2020 Nature article about quintessence, Carroll is quoted saying, “We’re back to a situation where we have zero idea about how the universe is going to end.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Isaac Asimov were alive today, I believe he would be delighted to know that his “last question” is still open. The increase in entropy in the universe is not equivalent to increasing cosmic disorganization. Complexity and entropy can grow together, and perhaps even without limit. I like to believe that this means that the universe is on our side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this essay incorrectly stated that the Hubble telescope confirmed that the universe was expanding. It was Edwin Hubble the person, not the telescope that was named after him.&lt;/p&gt;

I've never seen a language evolve that fast; I suspect you guys never sleep. I hope V will remain a simple, clean language and have a bright future. Thanks for all your hard work.

Joel L. I'm mostly surprised by how many things "just work". Channels and closures made implementing asynchronous callbacks for C functions such a breeze. Thanks for that! ð

hellolio V is the most comfortable syntax I've encountered, so I look forward to 1.0.

FlibbyJibbit Been programming for around 30 years. Have done some C/C++, VB, and lots of Delphi years ago. Then PHP/Ruby for over 15 years. Bash, Python too. Recently I've wanted to start using a compiled language for reasons, and have looked at Rust, Go, and a couple others. I stumbled upon V a few weeks ago and have been very surprised by how easy it is to pick up. I am really enjoying writing V and feel like I am already productive. Even to the point I'm now looking at making a small ...

pbarker Really like the direction of V, been wondering when this kind of language would pop up.

Flexibility for operator overloading. (it makes syntax intuitive) Compiles directly to C, and I love C Flexibility for having and not having garbage collection Go concurrency model visrut V is amazing. Things I like about it:

Hoss I come from a strong Java and Go background and have been playing with Rust. V looks pretty amazing in terms of readability.

devsou.com V is amazingly simple!

AndrÃ© L. I buy my son's diaper with C#, but every project I start today is in V. Because every project in C# has an initial load of bureaucracy that in V I don't have to deal with at the beginning, and I can plug bureaucracy into the project throughout the creation process.

Teddy Gotta say that V's syntax is amazing (especially the error handling aspect for me since I strongly dislike Go's error handling approach but liked its other aspects).



mint, maintainer of Vinix After V, developing a kernel in C results in more bugs, honestly more so because V catches a set of bugs and memory leakage that C simply doesn't.

laotzu Just want to say thank you for continuing to improve the language. Adding the GC was very nice and I find V my all-time favorite language. Using V is fun due to great syntax and tooling but also makes you a better developer as you try to understand how things work underneath.

Sh.a D'eau Just wanted to say thank you to everyone contributing to V! Before September 2023 I never really coded nor completed any project as the tools I had were less than ideal. In September I started learning V and now I have a really good prototype and a professional developer even reached out to me saying my code was really good! That's why I wanted to thank V and all the contributors ð¥°

compilation speed simplicity (only a few keywords), yet powerful readability &amp; maintainability execution performance cross compilation ... InspColumbo It's obvious that Alex was able to bring his experience of many other languages to V, giving the language a very solid foundation. It's difficult for me to list all the positive qualities I like about V because I'm sure I'll forget some. I'll try it anyway.

TenTypekMatus Thanks to everyone who contributed to this project. The simplicity of language and the fact that it's compiled makes it number 1 where applicable.

mihaigalos I think you do not get enough credit for the amazing language V is. Thank you for your time and effort.

chris_debian When I stumbled across V, it just 'felt right'.

nopana Thank you very much to everyone contributing to V! It's been 1.5 years since I've discovered it. I really enjoy the kind and helping community, the simplicity philosophy and lots of other things. I was pleasantly surprised by the easiness of creating an HTTP server: just a few lines and then handling the request is very easy by following the example. A big thank you from the bottom of my heart â¤ï¸

dovh49 V is the better Go. I use V in production for my personal projects. It is such a joy to use.

chris_debian When I stumbled across V, it just 'felt right'.

rodabt I mastered Python when I worked as a Data Scientist a few years ago. Since I discovered V I stopped using Python almost entirely, and now I look back and... it's awful. Never had so much fun programming as I am now.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45075571</guid></item><item><title>New research reveals longevity gains slowing, life expectancy of 100 unlikely</title><link>https://lafollette.wisc.edu/news/new-research-reveals-longevity-gains-slowing-life-expectancy-of-100-unlikely/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="bef4b19d4af65fbf"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new study co-authored by a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor finds that life expectancy gains made by high-income countries in the first half of the 20th century have slowed significantly, and that none of the generations born after 1939 will reach 100 years of age on average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study by Héctor Pifarré i Arolas of the La Follette School of Public Affairs, José Andrade of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, and Carlo Giovanni Camarda of the Institut national d’études démographiques analyzed life expectancy for 23 high-income and low-mortality countries using data from the Human Mortality Database and six different mortality forecasting methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The unprecedented increase in life expectancy we achieved in the first half of the 20th century appears to be a phenomenon we are unlikely to achieve again in the foreseeable future,” according to Pifarré i Arolas. “In the absence of any major breakthroughs that significantly extend human life, life expectancy would still not match the rapid increases seen in the early 20th century even if adult survival improved twice as fast as we predict.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From 1900 to 1938, life expectancy rose by about five and a half months with each new generation. The life expectancy for an individual born in a high-income country in 1900 was an average of 62 years. For someone born just 38 years later in similar conditions, life expectancy had jumped to 80 years on average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those born between 1939 and 2000, the increase slowed to roughly two and a half to three and a half months per generation, depending on the forecasting method. Mortality forecasting methods are statistical techniques that make informed predictions about future lifespans based on past and current mortality information. These models enabled the research team to estimate how life expectancy will develop under a variety of plausible future scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We forecast that those born in 1980 will not live to be 100 on average, and none of the cohorts in our study will reach this milestone. This decline is largely due to the fact that past surges in longevity were driven by remarkable improvements in survival at very young ages,” according to corresponding author Andrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the 20th century, infant mortality fell rapidly due to medical advances and other improvements in quality of life for high-income countries. This contributed significantly to the rapid increase in life expectancy. However, infant and child mortality are now so low that the forecasted improvements in mortality in older age groups will not be enough to sustain the previous pace of longevity gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While mortality forecasts can never be certain as the future may unfold in unexpected ways – by way of pandemics, new medical treatments or other unforeseen societal changes – this study provides critical insight for governments looking to anticipate the needs of their healthcare systems, pension planning and social policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although a population-level analysis, this research also has implications for individuals, as life expectancy influences personal decisions about saving, retirement and long-term planning. If life expectancy increases more slowly as this study shows is likely, both governments and individuals may need to recalibrate their expectations for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
