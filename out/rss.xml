  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 1**&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above is a graph that displays the amount of Form Ds filed, where the entity (read: company/firm) name contains the phrases "fund I", "fund II", "fund III", and "fund IV". The x-axis is not the prettiest, but it is broken down by quarter. You can see that the line for "fund I" sees by far the greatest peak around quarter 3 of 2022, with a steep drop off immediately after. The other lines have a similar, but less pronounced trend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what is the significance of this? Companies and firms file Form Ds in compliance with Regulation D, which requires disclosure when raising funds under specific circumstances. I won't go into the details here, but the TLDR is that it isn't always required, but it's not uncommon either. Another piece of context is that venture capital firms (among other financial investment groups) label their individual funds, often by appending Fund [&amp;lt;fund roman numeral&amp;gt;] to describe where the fund falls in their sequence of funds. Here is a search query on the SEC filings database. You can see how the naming convention works. Each fund often constitutes its own entity. My hypothesis here is that, by charting the amount of Form Ds filed with "fund [#]" in the name, we can roughly see the state of venture capital “fund” raising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Takeaways&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. From this graph we can roughly see the ratio of venture firms that make it to a given fund cycle. That's a little hard to claim as the funds get higher in number, because once firms get large enough, they often stop creating sequential funds, instead raising in parallel and creating funds targeting specific industries/products etc. If you are planning to start a venture firm though, you may gain a bit of insight into your odds of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Venture funding is about to drop off BIG time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the early 2020s, everyone and their mom raised a VC fund. This is due to several factors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that I estimated these values by looking at similarities matching entities listed on the Forms that were also associated with Angellist/Sydecar/other fund backend providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These groups likely also contribute to the fluffing of the venture economy by increasing access to investments in startups*.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As interest rates increased, and things settled down, the amount of venture firms raising new funds decrease, as evidenced by the decrease in Form Ds with “fund [#]” in the name after Q3 2022 shown in figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why we are going to see the effects of the bubble now&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making the assumptions that a) most venture funds target a life span of ~10 years and b) the capital deployment stage of funds lasts 2-4 years (again, roughly), we are just passing the moment of peak fund availability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has all coincided nicely with an immense increase in expectations put on startups focused on AI solutions. Investor interest in wrapper/agent/AI lab companies has seemed insatiable over the past 18 months, in alignment with the end of the funding deployment stage for funds that raised at the peak. This has led to more startups raising rounds at higher valuations (see another keyword search based graph below).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My predictions, based on the above data, and my anecdotal experience is that the amount of venture funding available is about to decrease. This will lead to lower valuations as the supply of funds decreases, inducing relative scarcity. As a result many companies will be left “swimming naked as that tide goes out”. This along with other issues such as (very) newly decreasing expectations of the AI vertical as a whole could lead to a sizable contraction. The decrease in available funding will also put more pressure on companies to actually ** make money **. Unless compute becomes much more cost effective in the immediate future, foundational model providers will be required to raise their prices to supplement equity based funding for compute cost, likely causing wrappers and agent companies to do the same. Some users will be priced out, and likely, many companies will no longer be viable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this to say: A future contraction may not be the exclusive result of changing sentiment in the AI industry. Sure that's part of it, but the availability of VC funds has been destined to decrease since firm fundraising peaked in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The offering amount represents the sum of all “total offering amounts” listed on all Form Ds containing “ ai” or “.ai” in the entity names for a given quarter. Note: 2025 sees a dip because only quarters 1 and 2 are accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TJ Jefferson&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*As a sidenote I do think these services offer ways to anonymize funding sources, and allow potentially less savvy investors (God forbid, unaccredited) to be duped into investing at insanely high valuations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;**This is an updated graph from an the original where some values were double counted. This issue did not change any aspect of the argument laid out in this essay, and the depicted trends are nearly identical. Please email me if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPUPrefixSums aims to bring state-of-the-art GPU prefix sum techniques from CUDA and make them available in portable compute shaders. In addition to this, it contributes "Decoupled Fallback," a novel fallback technique for Chained Scan with Decoupled Lookback that should allow devices without forward thread progress guarantees to perform the scan without crashing. The D3D12 implementation includes an extensive survey of GPU prefix sums, ranging from the warp to the device level; all included algorithms utilize wave/warp/subgroup (referred to as "wave" hereon) level parallelism but are completely agnostic of wave size. As a measure of the quality of the code, GPUPrefixSums has also been implemented in CUDA and benchmarked against Nvidia's CUB library. Although GPUPrefixSums aims to be portable to any wave size supported by HLSL, [4, 128], due to hardware limitations, it has only been tested on wave sizes 4, 16, 32, and 64. You have been warned!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in prefix sums for their use in radix sorting, check out GPUPrefixSum's sibling repository GPUSorting!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Decoupled Fallback, a threadblock will spin for a set amount of cycles while waiting for the reduction of a preceding partition tile. If the maximum spin count is exceeded, the threadblock is free to perform a fallback operation. Multiple thread blocks are allowed to perform fallbacks on the same deadlocking tile, but through use of atomic compare and swap, only one thread block ends up broadcasting its reduction in device memory. Although this means potentially performing redundant calculations, the upside is that fallback performance is no longer limited by the latency of signal propagation between thread blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of writing this 9/22/2024, Decoupled Fallback shows promising results on Apple M GPU's. However the version included here are out of date, with the most up-to-date development occuring in Vello.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A prefix sum, also called a scan, is a running total of a sequence of numbers at the n-th element. If the prefix sum is inclusive the n-th element is included in that total, if it is exclusive, the n-th element is not included. The prefix sum is one of the most important algorithmic primitives in parallel computing, underpinning everything from sorting, to compression, to graph traversal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Headless implementation in D3D12, includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce then Scan&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this implementation is to benchmark the algorithms and demystify their implementation in the CUDA environment. It is not intended for production or use; instead, a proper implementation can be found in the CUB library.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that Joel0 in the TrueNAS community has created a fork of TrueNAS that runs on Arm, I thought I'd give it a spin—on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I currently run an Ampere Arm server in my rack with Linux and ZFS as my primary storage server, and a Raspberry Pi with four SATA SSDs and ZFS as backup replica in my studio. My configuration for these Arm NASes is up on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been looking forward to TrueNAS support on Arm for years, though it seems the sentiment in that community was 'Arm servers aren't powerful enough to run serious storage servers'—despite myself and many others doing so for many years... but that's besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On a Raspberry Pi?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've found numerous times, running modern applications on slower hardware is an excellent way to expose little configuration flaws and misconceptions that lead to learning how to run the applications much better on more capable machines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From my Pi Dramble to my Petabyte Pi Project, running apps intended for much more powerful hardware taught me a lot. So maybe running TrueNAS, which demands 8 GB of RAM and 16 GB of primary storage, would be a fun learning exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've done it on x86 servers, but that's boring. It's easy. I don't learn much when a project goes off without a hitch, and I'm not forced to look closer at some of the configuration quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can watch the video for a full demo, or read on below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On a Raspberry Pi, there's no UEFI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One glaring problem with the Raspberry Pi is no official support for UEFI, a standard way to boot computers and interface operating systems to device firmware. Raspberry Pi only officially supports device-tree-based Linux booting, which is much less standard. That means you can't just throw any old Linux distribution on the Pi, you have to have ones tailored to the Pi. There are good OSes for the Pi, like Raspberry Pi OS, based on Debian. But it's not the same as grabbing Windows on Arm and installing it on my Ampere workstation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get past this restriction, we have to rely on a community project, forked from Windows on Raspberry Pi. Specifically, I'm using NumberOneGit's rpi5-uefi fork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get your Pi 5 to support UEFI (CM5 process may be slightly different):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update the EEPROM to the 2025-06-09 release (or later - check what version you're running in Pi OS with the command &lt;code&gt;rpi-eeprom-update&lt;/code&gt;): a. Typically, you can upgrade using Raspberry Pi Imager,&lt;code&gt;sudo apt full-upgrade -y&lt;/code&gt;, or&lt;code&gt;sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a&lt;/code&gt;. However, at the time of this writing, those methods will get you to the latest stable release (2025-05-08), so until then, use one of these methods: b. Manually update the bootloader with&lt;code&gt;usbboot&lt;/code&gt;from source. c. Switch to the beta bootloader release channel:&lt;code&gt;sudo nano /etc/default/rpi-eeprom-update&lt;/code&gt;, then change&lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt;, and run&lt;code&gt;sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a&lt;/code&gt;. d. Verify the bootloader version you're running with&lt;code&gt;rpi-eeprom-update&lt;/code&gt;after a reboot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download the latest .zip file release from rpi5-uefi Releases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Take a microSD card that's already formatted for the Pi (I just pulled the Pi OS card out of my Pi 5 that I just used for the EEPROM update), and clear out the contents of the FAT32 'bootfs' volume. Copy all the contents of the .zip file you downloaded into that folder (including &lt;code&gt;RPI_EFI.fd&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eject the microSD card, insert it into the Pi, and power it on with an HDMI display connected.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You should see a Raspberry Pi logo and the EDK2 bootloader screen appear. Unless you have NVMe or USB boot media installed, it will say "Press any key to enter the Boot Manager Menu."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Since I couldn't find the 'any' key, I pressed 'Enter', then I could navigate through a standard boot manager menu. In there you can configure SD card speeds, set the PCIe bus speed, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After you've changed the settings to your liking (see some suggestions for Linux), save and reset.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TrueNAS on a Pi 5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that the Pi is booting into UEFI mode, you can install TrueNAS. To do that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download a TrueNAS on Arm ISO from https://truenas-releases.jmay.us (I chose 25.04.2).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a tool like Etcher to write the ISO to a USB drive.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After Etcher finishes, eject the USB drive and insert it into the Pi (I used a USB 3 thumb drive, so I inserted it into one of the blue USB 3 ports on the Pi for maximum speed).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If it doesn't automatically boot to the TrueNAS installer, select the external USB drive in the UEFI boot manager and boot into the TrueNAS installer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Follow the TrueNAS installer's prompts to install TrueNAS on any device other than the installer drive or the microSD card (I used a second USB flash drive plugged into the other USB 3 port). Wait for installation to complete.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When prompted, reboot and remove the USB drive.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TrueNAS SCALE should boot up, and the first boot can take a while as many services need to generate files, configure services, and start them the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case, on first boot, the &lt;code&gt;ix-etc&lt;/code&gt; service failed to start (it timed out), and its purpose is to &lt;code&gt;Generate TrueNAS /etc files&lt;/code&gt;. After booting, I chose to enter the Linux console, then ran &lt;code&gt;systemctl start ix-etc&lt;/code&gt;, and rebooted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a reboot, TrueNAS seemed to launch all its services without issue, including the web UI. I visited the IP address printed on the console, logged in as the admin user I set up during install, and was greeted with the TrueNAS dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, most of the limitations are around missing features in UEFI mode; since Raspberry Pi hasn't pushed RP1 support into the Linux kernel, and nobody's yet reverse-engineered RP1 interfaces, you can't use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fan header PWM support (no fan control)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CSI/DSI connections for displays/cameras&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPIO&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built-in Ethernet&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ethernet limitation is especially annoying, as you are forced to use an external USB Ethernet dongle, just like on most non-Qualcomm systems running Windows on Arm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrea della Porta from SUSE is working on upstreaming RP1 support into Linux with some help from Raspberry Pi, but progress has been a bit slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I've been wondering lately, more and more: why doesn't Raspberry Pi consider official UEFI support in the first place? With or without Microsoft's official blessing, being able to boot vanilla Windows 11 for Arm on the Pi would be neat. Not to mention, any regular Linux Arm distro (including TrueNAS SCALE) would boot too...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently received a new hardware project, the Homelabs Pi Storage server, which uses a custom CM5 SATA backplane and a 3D printable enclosure for a 6-bay NAS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got TrueNAS installed on a CM5 Lite (using the same process as above), but when I installed four SATA hard drives, they spun up, but were not recognized. Right now the Pi 5 UEFI support doesn't allow for more than one PCIe device, and the Homelabs Pi Storage server has a PCIe switch that branches off to 2.5 Gbps Ethernet and a 6-port SATA controller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These devices all work perfectly out of the box on Raspberry Pi OS (and I was able to set up a ZFS array, getting 250 MB/s over the built-in 2.5G Ethernet—see below), but they aren't recognized currently when running under UEFI :(&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm already running vanilla ZFS under Raspberry Pi OS on my other Raspberry Pi storage server, and that's running on four SSDs and no hard drives. It can sustain 200 MB/sec writes, and I presume TrueNAS would be able to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also NVMe-only boards, like the $50 GeeekPi N16 Quad-NVMe HAT, which provide a pretty small footprint all-flash server option. But again, since those boards use switch chips (because the Pi is limited to 1 PCIe lane), none of those drives would be accessible to TrueNAS as it stands today. Your best bet if you want to use TrueNAS instead of just managing ZFS on you own on a Pi would be to use a single-purpose HAT or SATA controller or HBA in IT mode, to connect disks directly to the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the current UEFI limitations, I would still recommend running TrueNAS on higher-end Arm hardware (like Ampere servers). If you want to stick to an SBC, there's UEFI firmware for RK3588 platforms under active development. It may offer even more functionality for some boards, so check the compatibility list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or you could be boring and just install TrueNAS on x86, where it's fully supported ;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems the patch series from Andrea dela Porta is already merged into 6.17 - I can't paste the lore link because of your antispam system, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[Edit: Link added here https://lore.kernel.org/all/[email protected]/]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry about that; I had to set it to strict mode because otherwise I was getting at least a few hundred spam comments per day. It usually allows links, but maybe it scored the comment too high for other factors. I don't have much control besides 'strict' or not. Someday I'd like to run my own little spam filter, but last time I took a stab at it, it was still a bit too resource intensive to self-host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you know if the pi will ever support UEFI, or truenas officially on pi?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote terminal application that allows roaming, supports intermittent connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line editing of user keystrokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh is a replacement for interactive SSH terminals. It's more robust and responsive, especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh is free software, available for GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, Solaris, Android, Chrome, and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh automatically roams as you move between Internet connections. Use Wi-Fi on the train, Ethernet in a hotel, and LTE on a beach: you'll stay logged in. Most network programs lose their connections after roaming, including SSH and Web apps like Gmail. Mosh is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Mosh, you can put your laptop to sleep and wake it up later, keeping your connection intact. If your Internet connection drops, Mosh will warn you — but the connection resumes when network service comes back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSH waits for the server's reply before showing you your own typing. That can make for a lousy user interface. Mosh is different: it gives an instant response to typing, deleting, and line editing. It does this adaptively and works even in full-screen programs like emacs and vim. On a bad connection, outstanding predictions are underlined so you won't be misled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to be the superuser to install or run Mosh. The client and server are executables run by an ordinary user and last only for the life of the connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh doesn't listen on network ports or authenticate users. The mosh client logs in to the server via SSH, and users present the same credentials (e.g., password, public key) as before. Then Mosh runs the mosh-server remotely and connects to it over UDP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh is a command-line program, like ssh. You can use it inside xterm, gnome-terminal, urxvt, Terminal.app, iTerm, emacs, screen, or tmux. But mosh was designed from scratch and supports just one character set: UTF-8. It fixes Unicode bugs in other terminals and in SSH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike SSH, mosh's UDP-based protocol handles packet loss gracefully, and sets the frame rate based on network conditions. Mosh doesn't fill up network buffers, so Control-C always works to halt a runaway process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mosh package should be installed on both the client and server. Please find your platform below for installation instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a standalone OS X package that will work on any supported Macintosh. However, if you are using a package manager such as Homebrew or MacPorts, we suggest using it to get Mosh, for better compatibility and automatic updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no "native" mosh executable for Windows available at this time. The Chrome version of Mosh is the easiest way to use mosh on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;C:\&amp;gt; setup.exe -q mosh&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh on Cygwin uses OpenSSH and is suitable for Windows users with advanced SSH configurations. &lt;lb/&gt; Mosh is not compatible with Cygwin's built-in Windows Console terminal emulation. You will need to run Mosh from a full-featured terminal program such as mintty, rxvt, PuTTY, or an X11 terminal emulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;$ sudo apt-get install mosh&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ppa:keithw/mosh-dev PPA tracks the development version of Mosh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating system logos are trademarks or registered trademarks and are displayed for identification only.

        &lt;p&gt; Note that &lt;code&gt;mosh-client&lt;/code&gt; receives an AES session key as an environment
              variable.  If you are porting Mosh to a new operating system, please make sure that a
              running process's environment variables are not readable by other users.  We have
              confirmed that this is the case on GNU/Linux, OS X, and FreeBSD.

        be installed in the user's home directory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;$ mosh -p 1234 darth&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Useful when the server is behind a port-forwarder or NAT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;$ mosh --ssh="ssh -p 2222" figrindan&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;$ mosh --ssh="~/bin/ssh -i ./identity" fett&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;$ mosh --predict=never niennunb&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; switch is a synonym. By contrast,
      passing &lt;code&gt;--predict=always&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt;
      will enable instant local echo even on low-delay
      links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;$ mosh pello -- screen -dr&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reattaches to a long-running screen session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, logout or exit on the remote host will close the session. Mosh accepts the escape sequence &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-^
    .&lt;/code&gt;  (typically typed with Control-Shift-6, then a
    period) to end the connection forcibly. To send a
    literal Ctrl-^, type &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-^ ^&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More details can be found in the &lt;code&gt;mosh(1)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mosh-client(1)&lt;/code&gt;,
  and &lt;code&gt;mosh-server(1)&lt;/code&gt; manual pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mosh research paper describes the design and evaluation of Mosh in more detail than you may want. The paper was presented at the 2012 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, held June 13–15, 2012, in sunny Boston, Mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Mosh: A State-of-the-Art Good Old-Fashioned Mobile Shell essay gives further information about the design principles behind Mosh, including the "prophylactic retransmission" technique. The essay was published in USENIX ;login: magazine, August 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Why you should trust Mosh with your remote terminal needs: we worry about details so obscure, even USENIX reviewers don't want to hear about them.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote-shell protocols traditionally work by conveying a byte-stream from the server to the client, to be interpreted by the client's terminal. (This includes TELNET, RLOGIN, and SSH.) Mosh works differently and at a different layer. With Mosh, the server and client both maintain a snapshot of the current screen state. The problem becomes one of state-synchronization: getting the client to the most recent server-side screen as efficiently as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is accomplished using a new protocol called the State Synchronization Protocol, for which Mosh is the first application. SSP runs over UDP, synchronizing the state of any object from one host to another. Datagrams are encrypted and authenticated using AES-128 in OCB3 mode. While SSP takes care of the networking protocol, it is the implementation of the object being synchronized that defines the ultimate semantics of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roaming with SSP becomes easy: the client sends datagrams to the server with increasing sequence numbers, including a "heartbeat" at least once every three seconds. Every time the server receives an authentic packet from the client with a sequence number higher than any it has previously received, the IP source address of that packet becomes the server's new target for its outgoing packets. By doing roaming “statelessly” in this manner, roaming works in and out of NATs, even ones that may themselves be roaming. Roaming works even when the client is not aware that its Internet-visible IP address has changed. The heartbeats allow Mosh to inform the user when it hasn't heard from the server in a while (unlike SSH, where users may be unaware of a dropped connection until they try to type).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh runs two copies of SSP, one in each direction of the connection. The connection from client to server synchronizes an object that represents the keys typed by the user, and with TCP-like semantics. The connection from server to client synchronizes an object that represent the current screen state, and the goal is always to convey the client to the most recent server-side state, possibly skipping intermediate frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because SSP works at the object layer and can control the rate of synchronization (in other words, the frame rate), it does not need to send every byte it receives from the application. That means Mosh can regulate the frames so as not to fill up network buffers, retaining the responsiveness of the connection and making sure Control-C always works quickly. Protocols that must send every byte can't do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One benefit of working at the terminal layer was the opportunity to build a clean UTF-8 terminal emulator from scratch. Mosh fixes several Unicode bugs in existing terminals and in SSH, and was designed as a fresh start to try to be robust and correct even for pathological inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Mosh and the OS X Terminal correctly handle a Unicode combining character in the first column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Mosh will never get stuck in hieroglyphs when a nasty program writes to the terminal. (See Markus Kuhn's discussion of the relationship between ISO 2022 and UTF-8.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Mosh and GNOME Terminal have a defensible rendering when Unicode mixes with an ECMA-48/ANSI escape sequence. The OS X Terminal unwisely tries to normalize its input before the vt500 state machine, causing it to misinterpret and become unusable after receiving the following input!* (This also means the OS X Terminal's interpretation of the incoming octet stream varies depending on how the incoming octets are split across TCP segments, because the normalization only looks ahead to available bytes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* We earlier wrote that this misbehaving sequence "crashes" the OS X Terminal.app. This was mistaken—instead, Terminal.app interprets the escape sequence as shutting off keyboard input, and because of an unrelated bug in Terminal.app, it is not possible for the user to restore keyboard input by resetting the terminal from the menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the POSIX framework, the kernel needs to know whether the user is typing in an 8-bit character set or in UTF-8, because in canonical mode (i.e. "cooked" mode), the kernel needs to be able to delete a typed multibyte character sequence from an input buffer. On OS X and Linux, this is done with the "IUTF8" termios flag.) (See diagnostic explaining the need for this flag.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh sets the IUTF8 flag when possible and stubbornly refuses to start up unless the user has a UTF-8-clean environment. SSH does not set the IUTF8 flag, which can lead to garbage in input buffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other major benefit of working at the terminal-emulation layer is that the Mosh client is free to scribble on the local screen without lasting consequence. We use this to implement intelligent local echo. The client runs a predictive model in the background of the server's behavior, hypothesizing that each keystroke will be echoed at the cursor location and that the backspace and left- and right-arrow keys will have their traditional effect. But only when a prediction is confirmed by the server are these effects actually shown to the user. (In addition, by default predictions are only displayed on high-delay connections or during a network “glitch.”) Predictions are done in epochs: when the user does something that might alter the echo behavior — like hit ESC or carriage return or an up- or down-arrow — Mosh goes back into making background predictions until a prediction from the new batch can be confirmed as correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, unlike previous attempts at local echo with TELNET and RLOGIN, Mosh's local echo can be used everywhere, even in full-screen programs like emacs and vi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated Mosh using traces contributed by six users, covering about 40 hours of real-world usage and including 9,986 total keystrokes. These traces included the timing and contents of all writes from the user to the host and vice versa. The users were asked to contribute "typical, real-world sessions." In practice, the traces include use of popular programs such as the bash shell and zsh shells, the alpine and mutt e-mail clients, the emacs and vim text editors, the irssi and barnowl chat clients, the links text-mode Web browser, and several programs unique to each user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate typical usage of a "mobile" terminal, we replayed the traces over an otherwise unloaded Sprint commercial EV-DO (3G) cellular Internet connection in Cambridge, Mass. A client-side process played the user portion of the traces, and a server-side process waited for the expected user input and then replied (in time) with the prerecorded server output. We speeded up long periods with no activity. The average round-trip time on the link was about half a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We replayed the traces over two different transports, SSH and Mosh, and recorded the user interface response latency to each simulated user keystroke. The Mosh predictive algorithm was frozen prior to collecting the traces and was not adjusted in response to their contents or results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh reduced the median keystroke response time from 503 ms to nearly instant (because more than 70% of the keystrokes could be immediately displayed), and reduced the mean keystroke response time from 515 ms to 173 ms. Qualitatively, Mosh makes remote servers "feel" more like the local machine!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh was written by Keith Winstein, along with Anders Kaseorg, Quentin Smith, Richard Tibbetts, Keegan McAllister, and John Hood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practical latency on the Internet is on the increase, with the rise of bufferbloat and sophisticated wireless links that optimize for throughput over delay. And roaming is more common than ever, now that laptops and handheld devices have largely displaced desktops. SSH is great, but frustrating to use when you want to change IP addresses or have a long-delay link or a dodgy connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, TELNET had some good things going for it — a local-echo mode and a well-defined network virtual terminal. Even today, SSH doesn't properly support UTF-8 end-to-end on a POSIX system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think so. The design principles that Mosh stands for are conservative: warning the user if the state being displayed is out of date, serializing and checkpointing all transactions so that if there are no warnings, the user knows every prior transaction has succeeded, and handling expected events (like roaming from one WiFi network to another) gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those don't seem too controversial, but fancy apps like Gmail-in-Chromium or on Android still behave atrociously on dodgy connections or after switching IP addresses. (Have you ever had Gmail leave an e-mail message in "Sending..." for ten hours while merrily retrieving new mail and not indicating any kind of error? Us too.) We think there may be considerable room for improvement in many network user interfaces from the application of these values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To diagnose the problem, run &lt;code&gt;locale&lt;/code&gt; on the local
        terminal, and &lt;code&gt;ssh remotehost locale&lt;/code&gt;. To use Mosh,
        both sides of the connection will need to show a UTF-8 locale, like
        &lt;code&gt;LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On many systems, SSH will transfer the locale-related environment variables, which are then inherited by &lt;code&gt;mosh-server&lt;/code&gt;.  If this mechanism fails, Mosh (as of
        version 1.2) will pass the variables itself.  If neither
        mechanism is successful, you can do something like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;mosh remotehost --server="LANG=en_US.UTF-8 mosh-server"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;en_US.UTF-8&lt;/code&gt; does not exist on the remote server,
        you can replace this with a UTF-8 locale that does exist.  You
        may also need to set LANG locally for the benefit of
        &lt;code&gt;mosh-client&lt;/code&gt;.  It is possible that the local and
        remote machines will need different locale names. See also this GitHub
        ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;code&gt;mosh&lt;/code&gt; was able to start
    &lt;code&gt;mosh-server&lt;/code&gt; successfully on the remote machine, but the client is
    not able to communicate with the server.  This generally means that
    some type of firewall is
    blocking the UDP packets between the client and the server.  If you
    had to forward TCP port 22 on a NAT for SSH, then you will have to
    forward UDP ports as well.  Mosh will use the first available
    UDP port, starting at 60001 and stopping at 60999.  If you are only
    going to have a small handful of concurrent sessions on a server, then you can
    forward a smaller range of ports (e.g., 60000 to 60010).
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tools like netstat, netcat, socat, and tcpdump can be useful for debugging networking and firewall problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This problem can also be the result of a bug in glibc 2.22 that affects programs that link with protobuf and utempter and use aggressive compiler hardening flags. (glibc bugtracker entry, as well as Mosh bugtracker entry.) The problem causes mosh-server to segfault immediately on startup. We believe we have worked around this problem in Mosh 1.2.6, but please report a bug if you find otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're really not UTF-8 zealots. But it's a lot easier to correctly implement one terminal emulator than to try to do the right thing in a variety of difficult edge cases. (This is what GNU screen tries to do, and in our experience it leads to some very tricky-to-debug situations.) So mosh just won't start up until the user has everything configured for a UTF-8-clean pathway. It may be annoying, but it also probably reduces frustration down the road. (Unfortunately an 8-bit vt220 and a UTF-8 vt220 are different and incompatible terminal types; the UTF-8 goes in underneath the vt220 state machine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Mosh 1.2, you can pass arguments to &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;mosh remotehost --ssh="ssh -p 2222"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or configure a host alias in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; with a
        &lt;code&gt;Port&lt;/code&gt; directive.  Mosh will respect that too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please make sure that mosh is installed on the client, and mosh (or at least mosh-server) is installed on the server you are trying to connect to. Also, the server is expected to be available on your server's default login &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;, which is not
  usually true on OS X and BSD servers, or if you install mosh-server
  in your home directory.  In these cases please see the "Server
  binary outside path" instructions in the Usage section,
  above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some configurations, SSH canonicalizes the hostname before passing it to the Kerberos GSSAPI plugin. This breaks for Mosh, because the initial forward DNS lookup is done by the Mosh wrapper script. To work around this, invoke Mosh as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;mosh remotehost --ssh="ssh -o GSSAPITrustDns=no"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will often fail on a round-robin DNS setup. In that case it is probably best to pick a specific host from the round-robin pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh synchronizes only the visible state of the terminal. We are tracking this issue; see this issue and the others which are linked from there. For now, the workaround is to use screen or tmux on the remote side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you are running mosh in a terminal that advertises itself as 256-color capable. (This generally means TERM will be xterm-256color or screen-256color-bce.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On keyboards with the United States layout, this can be typed as Ctrl-Shift-6, or often as Ctrl-6 (this depends on your OS and terminal emulator). On non-US keyboards, it is often hard to find the right key, and sometimes it's not available at all. If your keyboard has a dead key with an accent-circumflex, this is not likely to be the right key. Ctrl-6 sometimes works, though. If you are unable to type this character, you will need to set the &lt;code&gt;MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY&lt;/code&gt; variable; see the Mosh man page for
  details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please see the entries for &lt;code&gt;MOSH_SERVER_NETWORK_TMOUT&lt;/code&gt;
      and &lt;code&gt;MOSH_SERVER_SIGNAL_TMOUT&lt;/code&gt; in the mosh-server(1) man page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosh 1.0 was released in March 2012. As of the release of Mosh 1.4.0 in October 2022, as far as the developers are aware:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think that Mosh's conservative design means that its attack surface compares favorably with more-complicated systems like OpenSSL and OpenSSH. Mosh's track record has so far borne this out. Ultimately, however, only time will tell when the first serious security vulnerability is discovered in Mosh—either because it was there all along or because it was added inadvertently in development. OpenSSH and OpenSSL have had more vulnerabilities, but they have also been released longer and are more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one concrete respect, the Mosh protocol is more secure than SSH's: SSH relies on unauthenticated TCP to carry the contents of the secure stream. That means that an attacker can end an SSH connection with a single phony "RST" segment. By contrast, Mosh applies its security at a different layer (authenticating every datagram), so an attacker cannot end a Mosh session unless the attacker can continuously prevent packets from reaching the other side. A transient attacker can cause only a transient user-visible outage; once the attacker goes away, Mosh will resume the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in typical usage, Mosh relies on SSH to exchange keys at the beginning of a session, so Mosh will inherit the weaknesses of SSH—at least insofar as they affect the brief SSH session that is used to set up a long-running Mosh session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that we know of—Mosh uses OCB3. The authors of the paper write that the attack is not applicable to OCB3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it works great, but please remember to open up UDP ports 60000–61000 on the EC2 firewall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you run &lt;code&gt;mosh user@server&lt;/code&gt;, if successful you will be dropped into your login
      shell on the remote machine.

      If you want
      to check that mosh is being used instead of ssh, try typing &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-^ Ctrl-Z&lt;/code&gt;
      to suspend the session (with mosh 1.2.4 or later on the client). Running &lt;code&gt;fg&lt;/code&gt; will then return.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mosh&lt;/code&gt; command is a wrapper script that is designed to be the primary way that
      you use mosh.  In most cases, you can simply just replace "ssh" with "mosh" in your command line.
      Behind the scenes, the &lt;code&gt;mosh&lt;/code&gt; wrapper script will SSH to the server, start up
      &lt;code&gt;mosh-server&lt;/code&gt;, and then close the SSH connection.  Then it will start up the
      &lt;code&gt;mosh-client&lt;/code&gt; executable on the client, passing it the necessary information for
      it to connect to the newly spawned &lt;code&gt;mosh-server&lt;/code&gt; instance.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In normal usage, &lt;code&gt;mosh-client&lt;/code&gt; and
      &lt;code&gt;mosh-server&lt;/code&gt; don't need to be run directly.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;mosh&lt;/code&gt; wrapper script isn't working for you, you can try running
    the &lt;code&gt;mosh-client&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mosh-server&lt;/code&gt; programs separately to
    form a connection. This can be a useful debugging technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Log in to the remote host, and run &lt;code&gt;mosh-server&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will give output like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;$ mosh-server MOSH CONNECT 60004 4NeCCgvZFe2RnPgrcU1PQw mosh-server (mosh 1.1.3) Copyright 2012 Keith Winstein &amp;lt;[email protected]&amp;gt; License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &amp;lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&amp;gt;.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strand is a marketing agency based in London, UK. The company specialises in copywriting and content creation for many of the world’s largest enterprise technology companies, running marketing programmes that produce hundreds of white papers, case studies, blog posts and articles every year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Challenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many years, Strand has relied on a custom-built project management system to support the operational aspects of its business—creating projects, tracking activities and managing documents. However, managing the financial aspects of project management had always been a more manual process, using spreadsheets to ensure that billable work was assigned to the correct purchase orders and invoices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Just before the pandemic, we decided to build a new financial management system,” recalls Ed Kelly, Director of Technology at Strand. “It turned out to be a very timely decision. When we had to pivot to remote working, the fact that everyone could track their billable work in a centralised system helped us keep the business on track.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new system quickly became an integral part of Strand’s daily workflow, and users began requesting new features. As the application gradually grew larger and more complex, the company’s small development team wanted to ensure that the system would remain reliable, maintainable and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Almost by accident, what we launched as a prototype became a business-critical application,” says Ed Kelly. “Our development resources are limited, so our top priority was to make sure the system would just run forever without needing constant maintenance. At the same time, we also wanted to keep the codebase simple and approachable, so it’s easy for developers to dive back into when they need to make a change. The challenge for us was to build and maintain this business-critical system cost-effectively with our lean development team.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Solution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a small business, Strand is not afraid to innovate. “We do have systems that are written in mainstream programming languages like Python and JavaScript, but our strategy is to pick the best tool for the job, not just the most popular,” explains Ed Kelly. “Gleam was a good fit for our requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The features of Gleam that appealed to Strand were its robustness and maintainability, its combination of modern language features with access to a broad ecosystem of battle-tested, production-grade libraries, and its strong focus on developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Safety and reliability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Gleam is a safe language,” explains Ed Kelly. “Broadly speaking, if you write a program in pure Gleam, it’s guaranteed not to crash. And in cases where you need to interface with code written in other, less-safe languages, there is a second layer of protection provided by Gleam’s runtime platform, the BEAM.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BEAM was developed by Ericsson in the 1980s as a fault-tolerant platform for managing large telephone switches that need to handle thousands of calls simultaneously and can never be taken offline for maintenance. The central idea is that the platform is able to divide applications into thousands or even millions of lightweight processes. Each process runs independently, and processes can communicate by sending messages to each other. If an individual process crashes, it can be restarted automatically without affecting any of the other processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The application that we’ve built is composed of several services that interact with the outside world,” explains Ed Kelly. “For example, we have a service that periodically downloads currency exchange rates from the UK government’s website, and another that syncs data with our project management system. The BEAM ensures that if there’s some unforeseen problem with any of these external services, it won’t crash our application.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Modernity and pragmatism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gleam is designed to be a simple language that provides powerful features while remaining resolutely practical. “It gives us access to features from more academic programming languages, but it makes them approachable,” says Ed Kelly. “The language is small—an experienced developer can learn it in an afternoon—and there is a strong focus on only having one way to do things. That means you can onboard new developers into a Gleam codebase quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Gleam code runs on the BEAM, developers also have easy access to thousands of high-quality software libraries. “The Gleam library ecosystem is growing rapidly year-on-year,” says Ed Kelly. “And when we need to, we can also reach for 40 years’ worth of battle-tested libraries written in other BEAM languages such as Erlang and Elixir. The language prioritises pragmatism over purity, which helps us get things done.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Developer experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Strand’s experience, Gleam’s developer tools are second to none. “When you download Gleam, you get all the tooling in a single package,” says Ed Kelly. “It integrates with your code editor to provide features like formatting, suggestions and autocomplete. The error messages are really friendly and helpful—when you make a mistake, Gleam will often tell you what you should have written. And it’s really fast—the days of going for a coffee break while you wait for your code to build are over.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He adds: “We’re heading into a new age of AI-assisted coding, and right now, it’s difficult to predict how that will play out. But if I had to place a bet, I would say that in the long run, AIs are more likely to generate high-quality code in a language like Gleam. Gleam makes it quick and easy for AIs to check their code, get instant feedback, and iterate. That should be an advantage compared to languages that are slow to build, have cryptic error messages, and can’t catch mistakes at build-time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Incremental adoption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Strand, introducing Gleam into its codebase was a low-risk, incremental process. “We started with just one service—our integration with the UK government’s currency exchange rate API,” says Ed Kelly. “We were so pleased with how it turned out that we then rewrote some of our other services in Gleam. And recently, we’ve decided to give Gleam an even more important role by replacing the whole part of the backend that talks to our database. We’re very confident that this will give us a safer and more maintainable codebase overall.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As one of the first companies in the world to run Gleam in production, Strand took a risk. Two years later, the development team is delighted with the decision. “Since we started, the language has really matured and reached a stable state,” says Ed Kelly. “The community has grown massively and there’s a real buzz around the language. It’s even starting to be recognised by mainstream industry analysts like Thoughtworks in their Technology Radar. I think today, Gleam is a safe and solid choice for companies to use in production.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since go-live, the Gleam code within Strand’s application has been rock-solid. “We’ve had zero Gleam-related crashes, and even when there have been issues with other parts of the system, the BEAM has kept everything running,” says Ed Kelly. “We’ve been able to fix problems without our users even noticing that anything was wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the language and the sophistication of the development tools also help to keep the codebase maintainable. “Even when we haven’t looked at the codebase for a few weeks, it’s easy to get back into it,” says Ed Kelly. “The language and tooling gently push you to use a consistent, idiomatic style, and to write clearly and simply without trying to be too clever. So, we don’t have to spend time puzzling out what our past selves were trying to do with the code that we wrote six months ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He concludes: “Adopting a new language is always a gamble, but Gleam has paid off. The belt-and-braces approach to safety and fault-tolerance has given us a system that just works, reliably, day in and day out, without constant babysitting and maintenance. For a team like ours, with many other priorities and projects we need to work on, the confidence that Gleam gives us is worth its weight in gold.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The generator is down, and we don’t have enough ice to continue icing the remains of soldiers killed in action. How much longer, ma’am?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the message I received while deployed to Balad, Iraq, as an Air Force second lieutenant. I was overseeing generators in theater, and the one powering the mortuary facility had failed. The clock was ticking. I didn’t have HVAC expertise or the necessary parts. The only viable backup generator was on the other side of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had two choices: initiate a long contracting process to hire a civilian technician, or send a convoy across Iraq for the backup unit — risking lives to get it there. We chose the convoy. We got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if we hadn’t?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That question — what if — has stuck with me. Because this wasn’t a theoretical delay. This was a real moment where a failure in repair readiness jeopardized our ability to care for the fallen with dignity and speed. And I know it wasn’t the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why I support the right to repair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve lived what it means when a piece of equipment fails at a critical time. I know how far away contractors can be when you need them most. And I know what our service members are capable of — if we trust them with the tools and training to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military right to repair means giving service members the ability to fix their own gear — on base, in the field or downrange — without having to wait on outside contractors. That includes access to the tools, parts and manuals they need to do the job. Right now, private companies can put restrictions on military equipment that block troops from making even basic repairs. That slows everything down, costs taxpayers more, and in the worst cases, puts lives at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, Congress has a chance to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to a growing, bipartisan push — including new legislation led by Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont. — right-to-repair reforms are being considered in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). These two senators, from opposite parties, have made it clear: The Pentagon is wasting billions, and service members are bearing the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Including the Warrior Right to Repair Act in the NDAA is a critical step forward for readiness, national security and the safety of warfighters downrange, and it’s taxpayer friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mission readiness depends on the ability to make repairs in the field. Service members need the tools, parts and authority to make immediate fixes themselves, without having to navigate red tape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When our military relies too heavily on private contractors for basic maintenance, that dependence gives outside companies leverage over military operations, introducing profit motives into urgent repair decisions. Our armed forces should operate on military timelines — not corporate maintenance schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warfighter safety is directly tied to the reliability of our gear. In high-risk environments, a delay in repairing a critical piece of equipment can mean the difference between life and death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right to repair is smart, responsible fiscal policy. Sustainment costs can represent up to 70% of a weapons system’s lifetime expense. When troops are blocked from doing basic repairs, costs increase and transparency disappears. That’s a waste of taxpayer dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, repairing our own equipment is critical to inculcating and maintaining a military culture of adaptability and self-reliance. We train service members to be problem solvers. Empowering them to repair their own gear isn’t just smart policy — it reflects the values we instill in every recruit. Right to repair honors that ethos and ensures we treat service members like professionals, not passive end-users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We wouldn’t tell a Marine they can’t clean their rifle without a manufacturer present. So why are we telling our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines they can’t fix a comms system or power supply?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m grateful that, in that moment in Iraq, we had a backup option — even if it meant launching a risky cross-country convoy. But what if we hadn’t? What if that second generator didn’t exist or wasn’t reachable in time? Without immediate repair options, the remains of our fallen could have become unrecognizable. The families who entrusted us with their loved ones would have suffered consequences that no one should have to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s what’s at stake when service members can’t repair the equipment they rely on. It’s not just about saving money or avoiding delays — it’s about honoring our dead, protecting the living and giving our troops the flexibility they need to do the right thing when it counts. Right to repair is about readiness. It’s about humanity. And it’s long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m calling on Congress — and especially House Armed Services Committee leaders like Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers — to include military right-to-repair provisions in this year’s NDAA by supporting the bipartisan Warrior Right to Repair Act.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey HN! We are Windsor and Cathy of Dedalus Labs (&lt;/p&gt;https://www.dedaluslabs.ai/&lt;p&gt;), a cloud platform for developers to build agentic AI applications. Our SDK allows you to connect any LLM to any MCP tools – local or hosted by us. No Dockerfiles or YAML configs required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a demo: https://youtu.be/s2khf1Monho?si=yiWnZh5OP4HQcAwL&amp;amp;t=11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last October, I was trying to build a stateful code execution sandbox in the cloud that LLMs could tool-call into. This was before MCP was released, and let’s just say it was super annoying to build… I was thinking to myself the entire time “Why can’t I just pass in `tools=code_execution` to the model and just have it…work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with MCP, you’re stuck running local servers and handwiring API auth and formatting across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc. before you can ship anything. Every change means redeploys, networking configs, and hours lost wrangling AWS. Hours of reading docs and wrestling with cloud setup is not what you want when building your product!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedalus simplifies this to just one API endpoint, so what used to take 2 weeks of setup can take 5 minutes. We allow you to upload streamable HTTP MCP servers to our platform. Once deployed, we offer OpenAI-compatible SDKs that you can drop into your codebase to use MCP-powered LLMs. The idea is to let anyone, anywhere, equip their LLMs with powerful tools for function calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code you write looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;  python
  client = Dedalus()
  runner = DedalusRunner(client)
  
  result = runner.run(
    input=prompt,
    tools=[tool_1, tool_2],
    mcp_servers=["author/server-1”, “author/server-2”],
    model=["openai/gpt-4.1”, “anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514”],  # Defaults to first model in list
    stream=True,
  )
  stream_sync(result)  # Streams result, supports tool calling too
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our docs start at &lt;/p&gt;https://docs.dedaluslabs.ai&lt;p&gt;. Here’s a simple Hello World example: &lt;/p&gt;https://docs.dedaluslabs.ai/examples/01-hello-world&lt;p&gt;. For basic tool execution, see &lt;/p&gt;https://docs.dedaluslabs.ai/examples/02-basic-tools&lt;p&gt;. There are lots more examples on the site, including more complex ones like using the Open Meteo MCP to do weather forecasts: &lt;/p&gt;https://docs.dedaluslabs.ai/examples/use-case/weather-foreca...&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still a bunch of issues in the MCP landscape, no doubt. One big one is authentication (we joke that the “S” in MCP stands for “security”). MCP servers right now are expected to act as both the authentication server and the resource server. That is too much to ask of server writers. People just want to expose a resource endpoint and be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, we are bullish on MCP. Current shortcomings are not irrecoverable, and we expect future amendments to resolve them. We think that useful AI agents are bound to be habitual tool callers, and MCP is a pretty decent way to equip models with tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aren’t quite yet at the stateful code execution sandbox that I wanted last October, but we’re getting there! Shipping secure and stateful MCP servers is high on our priority list, and we’ll be launching our auth solution next month. We’re also working on an MCP marketplace, so people can monetize their tools, while we handle billing and rev-share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re big on open sourcing things and have these SDKs so far (MIT licensed):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/dedalus-labs/dedalus-sdk-python&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/dedalus-labs/dedalus-sdk-typescript&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/dedalus-labs/dedalus-sdk-go&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/dedalus-labs/dedalus-openapi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would love feedback on what you guys think are the biggest barriers that keep you from integrating MCP servers or using tool calling LLMs into your current workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks HN!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

What should I use?</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45054260</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="36f11955b024abd9"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indonesia is currently in chaos. Earlier today, the government blocked access to Twitter &amp;amp; Discord knowing news spread mainly through those channels. Usually we can use Cloudflare's WARP to avoid it, but just today they blocked the access as well. What alternative should we use?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator (https://github.com/OperatorFoundation). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for a detailed answer. Might I rudely ask -- as you're knowledgeable in this space, what do you think of Mullvad's DAITA, which specifically aims to defeat traffic analysis by moving to a more pulsed constant bandwidth model?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DAITA was introduced after my time in the industry, but this isn't a new idea (though as far as I know, it's the first time this kind of thing's been commercialized).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's clever. It tries to defeat attacks against one of the tougher parts of VPN connections to reliably obfuscate, and the effort's commendable, but I'll stop short of saying it's a good solution for one big reason: with VPNs and censorship circumvention, the data often speaks for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A VPN provider working in this space will often have aggregate (and obviously anonymized, if they're working in good faith) stats about success rates and failure classes encountered from clients connecting to their nodes. Where I worked, we didn't publish this information. I'm not sure where Mullvad stands on this right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case -- some VPN providers deploying new technology like this will partner with the research community (because there's a small, but passionate formal research community in this space!) and publish papers, studies, and other digests of their findings. Keep an eye out for this sort of stuff. UMD's Breakerspace in the US in particular had some extremely clever people working on this stuff when I was involved in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder: are there "cloud drive virtual sneakernet" systems that will communicate e.g. by a client uploading URL request(s) as documents via OneDrive/SharePoint/Google Drive/Baidu etc., a server reacting to this via webhook and uploading (say) a PDF version of the rendered site, then allowing the client to download that PDF? You effectively use the CDN of that service as a (very slow) proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, https://xkcd.com/538/ applies in full force, and I don't have any background in the space to make this a recommendation!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn't apply imo as OP is probably not a high value target of the govt, he just wants to bypass his govt restrictions and I doubt the situation is so bad that the govt will send people physically to deal with people circumventing the block.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your solution could technically work over any kind of open connection / data transfer protocol that isn't blocked by the provider but it would be an absolute pain to browse the web that way and there are probably better solutions out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's an interesting idea, and probably something you might be able to achieve with a tool like h26forge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also probably more useful to just have a connection be fully dedicated to a VPN, and have the traffic volume over time mimic what you'd see in a video, rather than embedding it in a video -- thanks to letsencrypt, much of the web's served over TLS these days (asterisks for countries like KZ and TM which force the use of a state-sponsored CA), so going to great lengths to embed your VPN in a video isn't really practical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m curious about what makes it difficult to block a vpn provider long term. You said getting the software is difficult, but can a country not block known vpn ingress points?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A country can and absolutely will block known VPN ingress points. There are two tricks that we can use to circumvent this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Host on a piece of infrastructure that's so big that you can't effectively block it without causing a major internet outage (think: S3, Cloudflare R2, etc). Bonus points if you can leverage something like ECH (ex-ESNI) to make it harder to identify a single bucket or subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Keep spawning new domains and subdomains to distribute your binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are complications with both approaches. Some countries block ECH outright. Some have no problem shutting the internet down wholesale for a little bit. The domain-hopping approach presents challenges w/r/t establishing trust (though not insurmountable ones, much of the time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are thing that have to be judged and balanced on a case-by-case basis, and having partners on the ground in these places really helps reduce risk to users trying to connect from these places, but then you have to be very careful talking to then since they could themselves get in trouble for trying to organize a VPN distribution network with you. It's layers on layers, and at some point it helps to just have someone on the team with a background in working with people in vulnerable sectors and someone else from a global affairs and policy background to try and keep things as safe as they can be for people living under these regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've heard of domain fronting, where you host something on a subdomain of a large provider like Azure or Amazon. Is this what you're talking about when you say&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; - Host on a piece of infrastructure that's so big that you can't effectively block it without causing a major internet outage (think: S3, Cloudflare R2, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can one bounce VPN traffic through S3? Or are you just talking about hosting client software, ingress IP address lists, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's generally for distribution, but yeah, it's a form of domain fronting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some more niche techniques that are _really_ cool but haven't gained widespread adoption, too, like refractive routing. The logistics of getting that working are particularly challenging since you need a willing partner who'll undermine some of their trustworthiness with some actors to support (what is, normally, to them) your project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've come to a wrong place to ask. Most people here (judging by recommendations of own VPN instances, Tor, Tailscale/other Wireguard-based VPNs, and Mullvad) don't have any experience with censorship circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just look for any VPNs that are advertised specifically for China, Russia, or Iran. These are the cutting edge tech, they may not be so privacy-friendly as Mullvad, but they will certainly work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Just look for any VPNs that are advertised specifically for China, Russia, or Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I was working for a secret service for these countries, I would set up many "VPNs that are advertised specifically for x" as honeypots to gather data about any dissidents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr. Kafka, suspicion is healthy. However, abstraction provides no way forward when faced with practicalities instead of theory. Creates a Kafka-esque situation - anything suitable is by definition unsuitable. Better to focus on practical technical advice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm. People who recommend widely used approaches, and well-known, well-established providers, "don't have any experience with cenorship circumvention".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the solution is no-name providers using random ad-hoc hackery, chosen according to a criterion more or less custom designed to lead you into watering hole attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would recommend Psiphon [1,2] most (all?) of their code is open source and their main goal is to get around censorship blocks. They do have some crypto side projects but the main product is very solid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VPNs that are advertised are for-profit products, which means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. They are in most cases run by national spy agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. They will at least appear to work, i.e., they will provide you with access to websites that are blocked by the country you are in. Depending on which country's spies run the system, they may actually work in the sense of hiding your traffic from that country's spies, or they may mark you as a specific target and save all your traffic for later analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My inclination is to prefer free (open-source) software that isn't controlled by a company which can use that control against its users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, you have to host your free open-source VPN software somewhere. And then, (N. B.: technical and usability stuff aside, I'm talking only about privacy bits here) everything boils down to two equally nightmarish options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you use well-known cloud or dedicated hoster. All your traffic is now tied to the single IP address of that hoster. It may be linked to you by visiting two different sites from the same IP address. Furthermore, this hoster is legally required to do anything with your VPN machine on demand of corresponding state actors (this is not a speculative scenario; i. e. Linode literally silently MitMed one of their customers on German request). Going ever further, residential and company IPs have quite different rules when it comes to law enforcement. Seeding Linux ISOs from your residential IP will be overlooked almost everywhere (sorry, Germany again), but seeding Linux ISOs from AWS can easily be a criminal offense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, you use some shady abuse-proof hosting company, which keeps no logs (or at least says that) and accepts payments in XMR. Now you're logging in to your bank account from an IP address that is used to seedbox pirate content or something even more illegal, and you still don't know if anyone meddles with your VPN instance looking for crypto wallet keys in your traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VPN services have a lot of "good" customers for a small amount of IP addresses, so even if they have some "bad" actors, their IPs as a whole remain "good enough". And, as the number of customers is big, each IP cannot be reliably tied to a specific customer without access logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tor is a third option, at least as one layer, and seeding Linux ISOs is not, to my knowledge, a criminal offense in any jurisdiction, not even in China. I don't know where you got that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is absolutely self-evident that VPNs are considered high-value targets and that all spy agencies invest a chunk of resources to go after high-value targets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would invite you to read again the two claims made, and consider whether your statement actually addresses the veracity of either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be a little trite: we all agree that chickens like grain, but it does not follow that a majority of grain producers are secretly controlled by a cabal of poultry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;^ this comment is right on. The cutting edge of VPN circumvention is the one marketed to people in China. Last I poked at this there were a lot of options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a little, maybe enough to be dangerous. SSH won’t be sufficient to avoid all traffic analysis. Everyone can see how much traffic and the pattern of that traffic, which can leak info about the sort of things you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about ending up on a list, using things that look like VPNs while the VPNs are locked down is likely to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also… your neighbors in Myanmar didn’t do a lockdown during the genocide and things got pretty fucking dire as a result. People have taken different lessons from this. I’m not sure what the right answer is, and which is the greater evil. Deplatforming and arresting people for inciting riots and hate speech is probably the best you can do to maintain life and liberty for the most people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mullvad worked OK in China for me recently. Sometimes I'd have to try a few different endpoints before it worked. Something built specifically to work in those places would probably be better, but it wasn't too much trouble. Not necessarily a recommendation, just sharing one data point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give Trojan proxy a try. It's supposed to go unnoticed since it works on the https port 443. Something like: https://www.anonymous-proxies.net/products/residential-troja... If you get it with a residential IP is even better. Works great in Iran and China and i suspect will wotk great for you too&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Tor. Pros: Reasonably user friendly and easy to get online, strong anonymity, free. Cons: a common target for censorship, not very fast, exit nodes are basically universally distrusted by websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Tailscale with Mullvad exit nodes. Pros: little setup but not more than installing and configuring a program, faster than Got, very versatile. Cons: deep packet inspection can probably identify your traffic is using Mullvad, costs some money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Your own VPSs with Wireguard/Tailscale. Pros: max control, you control how fast you want it, you can share with people you care about (and are willing to support). Cons: the admin effort isn't huge but requires some skill, cost is flexible but probably 20-30$ per month minimum in hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailscale is completely unnecessary here, unless OP can't connect to Mullvad.net in the first place to sign up. But if the Indonesian government blocks Mullvad nodes, they'll be out of luck either way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; - Your own VPSs with Wireguard/Tailscale&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that from the POV of any websites you visit, you will be easily identifiable due to your static IP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My suggestion would be to rent a VPS outside Indonesia, set up Mullvad or Tor on the VPS and route all traffic through that VPS (and thereby through Mullvad/Tor). The fastest way to set up the latter across devices is probably to use the VPS as Tailscale exit node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailscale + Mullvad does have a privacy advantage over either one by itself: the party that could potentially spy on the VPN traffic (Mullvad) doesn’t know whose traffic it is beyond that it’s a Tailscale customer. Any government who wanted to trace specific traffic back to OP would need to get the cooperation of both Mullvad and Tailscale, which is a lot less likely than even the quite unlikely event of getting Mullvad to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And using another VPN like NordVPN or ProtonVPN is probably in the same category as Mullvad, but worth being cautious. If it's free, you are the product. If you pay, you're still sending your traffic to a publicly (usually) known server of a VPN. That metadata alone in some jurisdictions can still put you in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is good overview, I just wanted to add that a VPS IP is not a residential IP. You will encounter roadblocks when you try to access services if you appear to be coming from a VPS. Not that I had a better solution, just to clarify what you can expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wireguard is not censorship-resistant, and most VPN-averse countries block cross-border Wireguard. Why reply a practical question in an area in which you have no experience?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Indonesia is new to the game and might still be catching up. They’re probably playing whackamole with the most common public VPN providers and might not be doing deep packet inspection yet. I worked with someone getting traffic out of Hong Kong a year ago and there was a lot trial and error figuring out what was blocked and what was not. Wireguard was one that worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IMO most people should have a VPS even if you don't need it for tunneling. Living without having a place to just leave services/files is very hard and often "free" services will hold your data hostage to manipulate your behavior which is annoying on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah they can be cheap, but I would definitely recommend having at least 3 for redundancy. If one get shut down or it's IP blacklisted you still hopefully have a backup line to create a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; cost is flexible but probably 20-30$ per month minimum in hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$4/month VPS from DigitalOcean is more than enough to handle a few users as per my experience. I have a Wireguard setup like this for more than a year. Didn't notice any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great thing about China's Great Firewall is that really good options to circumvent censorship have been around for a while. Was waiting for someone to bring up XRay! Alternatively, here is a great write up of using V2Ray[1]. May be worth OP looking into, as a blogger I found noted[2] is an alternative to a VPN, and may work.

    &lt;p&gt;Something quite depressing is if we (HN crowd) find workarounds, most regular folks won't have the budget/expertise to do so, so citizen journalism will have been successfully muted by government / big media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't worry, you shouldn't underestimate the capability of society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grew up in a pretty deprived area of the UK, and we all knew "a guy" who could get you access to free cable, or shim your electric line to bypass the meter, or get you pirated CD's and VHS' and whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will always be "that guy down the pub" selling raspberry pi's with some deranged outdated firmware that runs a proxy for everything in the house or whatever. To be honest with you, I might end up being that guy for a bunch of people once I'm laid off from tech like the rest. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally I would agree with you, but the ability to pull this kind of thing off hinges on there being enough shadows that the Eye doesn't look at for prolonged periods of time. And the overall trajectory of technological advance lately is such that those shadows are rapidly shrinking. First it was the street cameras (and UK is already one of the most enthusiastic adopters in the world). And now comes AI which can automatically sift through all the mined data, performing sentiment analysis etc. I feel that the time will come pretty soon when "a guy" will need to be so adept at concealing the tracks in order to avoid detection that most people wouldn't have access to one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They can barely handle wolf-whistlers let alone pedophile rape gangs consisting of the lowest IQ dregs of our society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know it’s only painfully stupid people who think the law is stupid, but dodgy Dave down the way tends to fly under the radar. Otherwise there wouldn’t be so many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't worry, you shouldn't underestimate the capability of society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should be worried. Don't underestimate the capabilities of the government bureaucrats. That "guys down the pub" will quickly disappear once they start getting jail time for their activities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think you really overestimate the capability of the UK to enforce laws. Yes, they can write them and yes they can fine large corporations, that's basically it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They cannot enforce laws against such "petty" crimes, the reason society mostly functions in the UK is because most people don't try to break the law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty sure the local punters would kick the cops out if they came for one of their own, especially if he got them their porn back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not just about UK abilities to enforce laws, but also about other factors. The described activities are extremely unattractive as criminal: small market, small margin, the need for planning, preparation and qualification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no need for special efforts to enforce the law. Put a few people in jail - and everyone else will quickly find safer and more legal ways to spend their time. No one will do something like that unless they are confident of their impunity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, it's also dystopian to pin one's future on such hopes. People need to stick it to the government and demand their freedoms. Far too many things are being forced on us in the West that go against fundamental values that have been established for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somehow, things that could be unifying protests where the working class of every political stripe are able to overlook their differences and push back against government never seem to happen. It is always polarized so that it's only ever one side at a time, and the other side is against them. How does that work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reflex. People's opinion on a subject changes if you tell them which political group supports it, sometimes even if they get asked twice in a row. Tribal identity determines ideology more than the other way around for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So as soon as Labour comes out for something, Cons are inclined to be against it and so on. The only way to have neutral protests is if no one visibly backs them and they don't become associated with a side, but then how do they get support and organization?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess 99% of mainstream "journalism" is irrelevant and/or inaccurate, hence citizen journalism is a 10x improvement in accuracy and relevancy! Not 10% better, 900% better! This makes a huge difference to our society as a whole and in our daily lives!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this misses the most important point which is that the user should have the right to choose for themselves what they say and read. Making citizen journalism unduly burdensome deprives everyone of that choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Remember it doesnt matter what the video shows, it only matters who showed it to you&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an age of mass media (where there's a video for anything) or now one step further synthetic media knowing who makes something is much more important than the content, given that what's being shown can be created on demand. Propaganda in the modern world is taking something that actually happened, and then framing it as an authentic piece of information found "on the street", twisting its context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"what's in the video" is now largely pointless, and anyone who isn't gullible will obviously always focus on where the promoter of any material wants to direct the audiences attention to, or what they want to deflect from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, anyone who has been watching politics for a few decades understands that the left/right dichotomy is primarily one designed to keep the majority of people within a certain set of bounds. We see it revealed when politicians and ideologies that should be in opposition to one another still cooperate on the same strategies, like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal right now is to make online anonymity impossible. Adult content is the wedge issue being used to make defending it unpalatable for any elected official, but nobody actually has it as a goal to prevent teenagers from looking at porn - if they did, they would be using more direct and efficient strategies. No, it's very clear that anonymous online commentary is hurting politicians and they are striking back against it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has been my impression that in UK, both parties are strongly authoritarian, with the sole difference being what kinds of speech and expression, precisely, they want to police.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the major Australian parties (Liberal and Labor) seem as spineless as each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They're being pushed by media conglomerates News Corp and Nine Entertainment [0] to crush competition (social media apps). With the soon-to-be-introduced 'internet licence' (euphemism: 'age verification'), and it's working. If they ban VPN's, it will make social media apps even more burdensome to access and use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[0] News Corp and Nine Entertainment together own 90% of Australian print media, and are hugely influential in radio, digital and paid and free-to-air TV. They have a lot to gain by removing access to social media apps, where many (especially young) people get their information now days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently traveling in Uzbekistan and am surprised that wireguard as a protocol is just blocked. I use wireguard with my own server, because usually governments just block well known VPN providers and a small individual server is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's the first time I've encountered where the entire protocol is just blocked. Worth checking what is blocked and how before deciding which VPN provider to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, think about it - almost every other interaction you can have with an individual in another country is mediated by government. Physical interaction? You need to get through a border and customs. Phone call? Going through their exchanges, could be blocked, easy to spy on with wiretaps. Letter mail? Many cases historically of all letters being opened before being forwarded along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We lived through the golden age of the Internet where anyone was allowed to open a raw socket connection to anyone else, anywhere. That age is fading, now, and time may come where even sending an email to someone in Russia or China will be fraught with difficulty. Certainly encryption will be blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're going to need steganographic tech that uses AI-hallucinated content as a carrier, or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloak + wireguard should work fine on the server side. The problem is that I didn't find any clients for Android and I doubt there are clients for iOs that can (a) open a cloak tunnel and then (b) allow wireguard to connect to localhost...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year ago I was traveling through Uzbekistan while also partly working remotely. IKEv2 VPN was blocked but thankfully I was able to switch to SSL VPN which worked fine. I didn't expect that, everything else (people, culture) in the country seemed quite open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's UDP, not TCP (like TLS) and has a distinguishable handshake. Wireguard is not designed as a censorship prevention tool, it's purely a networking solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tunnel itself is encrypted, but the tunnel creation and existence is not obfuscated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mastodon is not easy for regimes to completely block, and most instances won't block you for using Tor. Mastodon saw a huge migration from Brazil when X was blocked there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be easy to block on protocol level. Countries that block VPNs usually progress to that level pretty fast once they discover that simple IP blocks don't work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can still get SSH access and can establish an account with a VPS provider with endpoints outside your country of origin, https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand is a little long in the tooth but may still be viable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tunneling via SSH (ssh -D) is super easy to detect. The government doesn't need any sophisticated analysis to tell SSH connections for tunneling from SSH connections where a human is typing into a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countries like China have blocked SSH-based tunneling for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can also block sessions based on packet sizes: a typical web browsing session involves a short HTTP request and a long HTTP response, during which the receiving end sends TCP ACKs; but if the traffic traffic mimics the above except these "ACKs" are a few dozen bytes larger than a real ACK, it knows you are tunneling over a different protocol. This is how it detects the vast majority of VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One alternative would be to set up a VPS, run VNC on it, run your browser on that to access the various web sites, and connect over an SSH tunnel to the VNC instance. Then it actually is an interactive ssh session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;15 years ago, I was using EC2 at work, and realized it was surprisingly easy to SSH into it in a way where all my traffic went through EC2. I could watch local Netflix when traveling. It was a de facto VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details are not at the top of my mind these years later, but you can probably rig something up yourself that looks like regular web dev shit and not a known commercial VPN. I think there was a preference in Firefox or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue these days is that all of the EC2 IP ranges are well known, and are usually not very high-reputation IPs, so a lot of services will block them, or at least aggressively require CAPTCHAs to prevent botting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Source: used to work for a shady SEO company that searched Google 6,000,000 times a day on a huge farm of IPs from every provider we could find&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AmneziaWG client worked just fine with normal Wireguard servers in Egypt where official Wireguard clients doesn't, WGTunnel app on android support both protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most effective solution is to use X-ray/V2ray with VLESS, or VMESS, or Trojan as a protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another obfuscated solution is Amnezia&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are not ready to set up your own VPN server and need any kind of connection right now, try Psiphon, but it's a proprietary centralized service and it's not the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nations severing peoples connections to the world is awful. I'm so sorry for the chaos in general, and the state doing awful things both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go on https://lowendbox.com and get a cheap cheap cheap VPS. Use ssh SOCKS proxy in your browser to send web traffic through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very unfancy, a 30+ year old solution, but uses such primitive internet basics that it will almost certainly never fail. Builtin to everything but Windows (which afaik doesn't have an ssh client built-in).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Massive protests have occurred due to obvious government corruption. In particular the housing allowance for a month for a parliamentarian is now ten times the minimum wage for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give Obscura a try, we get around internet restrictions by using QUIC as transport, which looks like HTTP/3 and doesn't suffer from TCP-over-TCP meltdown: https://obscura.net/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I like Amnezia VPN, it has some ways to work around blocks: https://amnezia.org/en You can very easily self-host it, their installer automatically works on major cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though if Indonesia has blocked VPNs only now, possibly they only block major providers and don't try to detect the VPN protocol itself, which would make self-hosting any VPN possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Folks who are looking to bypass censorship, and those who live in countries where their internet connection is not currently censored who would like to help, can look to https://snowflake.torproject.org/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone based in China, it's a bit surprising that techniques used by Chinese people get very few mentions here, while I do think they are quite effective against access blocking, especially after coevolving with GFW for the past decade. While I do hope blocking in Indonesia won't get to GFW level, I will leave this here in case it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found this article [0] summarizing the history of censorship and anti-censorship measures in China, and I think it might be of help to you if the national censorship ever gets worse. As is shown in the article, access blocking in China can be categorized into several kinds: (sorted by severity)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. DNS poisoning by intercepting DNS traffic. This can be easily mitigated by using a DOT/DOH DNS resolver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Keyword-based HTTP traffic resetting. You are safe as long as you use HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. IP blocking/unencrypted SNI header checking. This will require the use of a VPN/proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. VPN blocking by recognizing traffic signatures. (VPNs with identifiable signatures include OpenVPN and WireGuard (and Tor and SSH forwards if you count those as VPNs), or basically any VPN that was designed without obfuscation in mind.) This really levels up the blocking: if the government don't block VPN access, then maybe any VPN provider will do; but if they do, you will have a harder time finding providers and configuring things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Many other ways to detect and block obfuscated proxy traffic. It is the worse (that I'm aware of), but it will also cost the government a lot to pull off, so you probably don't need to worry about this. But if you do, maybe check out V2Ray, XRay, Trojan, Hysteria, NaiveProxy and many other obfuscated proxies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But anyways, bypassing techniques always coevolve with the blocking measures. And many suggestions here by non-Indonesian (including mine!) might not be of help. My personal suggestion is to find a local tech community and see what techniques they are using, which could suit you better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WireGuard should still work. Tons of different providers. I trust Mullvad but ProtonVPN has a free tier. If they start blocking WireGuard, check out v2ray and xray-core. If those get blocked... that means somehow they're restricting all HTTPS traffic going out of the country&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;shadowsocks was the winner of the state of the art I had to do at work. It address the "long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a stat)" comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I live in Pakistan and two years back we had this exact same problem, (election interference) and frankly, you just try to scrape through solutions, but without an answerable government, there is little you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tried things like Proton VPN and Windscribe VPN, as well as enabling MT proxy on Telegram, but soon govts find it easier to just mass ban internet access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use Netblocks.org to analyse the level of internet blockage and try to react accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd recommend using Outline - it's a one click setup that lets you provision your own VPN on a cloud provider (or your own hardware).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since you get to pick where the hardware is located and it is just you (or you and a small group of friends &amp;amp; family) using the VPN, blocking is more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don't want the hassle of using your own hardware you can rent a Digital Ocean droplet for &amp;lt;$5 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve set this up for friends in fairly heavily censored countries before, it has been working well so far, but as others have said, this is a cat and mouse game&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AmneziaVPN has censorship circumvention options and makes it easy to set up a self hosted instance of that's what you prefer, or use their hosted service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using full-blown VPNs under such environments has the disadvantage of affecting your use of domestic web services. You might want to try something like https://github.com/database64128/shadowsocks-go, which allows you to route traffic based on domain and IP geolocation rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Some demonstrators on Monday were seen on television footage carrying a flag from the Japanese manga series One Piece, which has become a symbol of protest against government policies in the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;there is a major protest currently happening due to the legislative body representative just giving themselves a monthly domicile stipend of ~$3300 on top of their salaries (yes, multiple), while the average people earned ~$330 monthly. the information about the protest are not broadcasted on local TVs, so the only spread of information is through social media. i guess since a lot of people went around it using VPN, the gov decided to block it too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The official word is to counter gambling. Lately the government is not really popular after some decisions that could be interpreted as authoritative, and as citizens have spoken out about it online, causing more voices to join and protests erupting..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So well, my guess is they're trying to control it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch an EC2 instance in the US region (Ubuntu, open ports 22 and 1194), then connect via SSH and run the OpenVPN install script. Generate the .ovpn profile with the script and download it to your local machine. Finally, import the file into the OpenVPN client and connect to route traffic through the US server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually when countries block websites they don't block major cloud providers, like AWS and Google Cloud. Because most websites are hosted on them. So you can get a cheap VPS from AWS or GCP (always free VM is available) and host OpenVPN on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the Tor browser window in Brave. It's nowhere near as anonymous as the Tor browser, but the built in ad blocking makes browsing via Tor usable. And that's what you and your compatriots are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prepare to fill in Cloudflare captchas all day, but that's what it takes to have a bit of privacy nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could rent a cheapo instance at a cloud provider and tunnel https over ssh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s basically undetectable. Long lived ssh connection? Totally normal. Lots of throughput? Also normal. Bursts throughput? Same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not sure how to do this on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailscale might be an option too (they have a free account for individuals and an exit node out of country nearly bypasses your problem) It uses wireguard which might not be blocked and which comes with some plausible deniability. It’s a secure network overlay not a VPN. It just connects my machines, honest officer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, the general population that wants to use blocked services will develop enough technical know-how to circumvent it. The biggest risk is that there are bad actors giving malicious advice and to such learners, looking to defraud or otherwise exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set up a VM on AWS/azure/gcp/... in the desired cell, install a VPN server and done. Once you have automation in place it takes ~2 minutes to start, you can run it on demand so you can pay per minute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was wondering something like this but in a different capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What with certain countries (they know who they are) and their hatred for encryption, it got me wondering how people would communicate securely if - for example - Signal/WhatsApp/etc. pulled out and the country wound up disconnecting the submarine cables to "keep $MORAL_PANIC_OF_THE_DAY safe."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How would people communicate securely and privately in a domestic situation like that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;include SSH traffic protocol auto-swapping on your server (i.e. no way to tell the apparent web page differs between clients), as some corporate networks are infamously invasive. People can do this all day long, and they do... =3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the various proxy solutions offered are good (although the simplest ones - like squid - haven't been mentioned yet). You can also use a remote desktop or even just ssh -Y me@remote-server "firefox"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In countries where it comes to government blocking/censoring internet traffic, traditional media is cleared of all dissent and fully controlled long before. Last stages of that are happening in my country, Serbia, currently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a mixed bag apparently, free press is technically legal since 1998 but selective prosecution and harassment of those actually uncovering issues (mainly becomes clear in the last section, "Safety")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tried looking up Serbia next on that website but got a cloudflare block. I'm a robot now...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not a dumb question at all. Level on hn really got down lately if you're getting downvoted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about it Aachen. If the government has enough power to censor internet traffic, that what was the first thing it censored? Which media is traditionally known for being censored or just speaking propaganda? That's the classical newspapers. It's not uncommon in authoritarian countries for editors to need state to sign off on the day's paper. And if not that, articles are signed and publishers are known. They will auto-censor to avoid problems. Just like creators on YouTube don't comment on this one country's treatment of civilians to avoid problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From some of the comments here I get why you are downvoted. But tbh I would also have gone that route. So are we just inexperienced? I read here indeed that wireguard is very easily blocked. It was at the company I worked for but then I just set port 23 (who uses ftp anyways??). And it worked. But why is this still bad then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outline is an open source shadowsocks client, and you provision your own server to act as the proxy. You can use it against any Shadowsocks server you want, and the protocol makes it look like regular https traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use an Actual Private Network? Radio links that you control. Peer with someone who owns a Starlink terminal. Rent instances in GCP's Jakarta datacenter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Uncertain⟨T⟩&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know what’s wrong with people? They’re too sure of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better to be wrong and own it than be right with caveats. Hard to build a personal brand out of nuance these days. People are attracted to confidence — however misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But can you blame them? (People, that is) Working in software, the most annoying part of reaching Senior level is having to say “it depends” all the time. Much more fun getting to say “let’s ship it and iterate” as Staff or “that won’t scale” as a Principal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, for all of our intellectual humility, why do we &lt;del&gt;write&lt;/del&gt; vibe code like this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if current&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPS coordinates aren’t exact. They’re noisy. They’re approximate. They’re probabilistic. That &lt;code&gt;horizontal&lt;/code&gt; property tucked away in your &lt;code&gt;CLLocation&lt;/code&gt; object
              is trying to tell you something important:
              you’re probably within that radius.
              Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;, meanwhile, can be only &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.
              That &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement needs to make a choice one way or another,
              but code like this doesn’t capture the uncertainty of the situation.
              If truth is light,
              then current programming models collapse the wavefunction too early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Picking the Right Abstraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2014, researchers at the University of Washington and Microsoft Research proposed a radical idea: What if uncertainty were encoded directly into the type system? Their paper, Uncertain&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;: A First-Order Type for Uncertain Data introduced a probabilistic programming approach that’s both mathematically rigorous and surprisingly practical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you’d expect for something from Microsoft in the 2010s, the paper is implemented in C#. But the concepts translate beautifully to Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find my port on GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import Uncertain
import Core&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you compare two &lt;code&gt;Uncertain&lt;/code&gt; values,
              you don’t get a definitive &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.
              You get an &lt;code&gt;Uncertain&amp;lt;Bool&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that represents the probability of the comparison being &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same is true for other operators, too:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// How fast did we run around the track?
let distance: Double = 400 // meters
let time: Uncertain&amp;lt;Double&amp;gt; = .normal(mean: 60, standard&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code builds a computation graph, sampling only when you ask for concrete results. The library uses Sequential Probability Ratio Testing (SPRT) to efficiently determine how many samples are needed — maybe a few dozen times for simple comparisons, scaling up automatically for complex calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Sampling happens only when we need to evaluate
if ~(running&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using an abstraction like &lt;code&gt;Uncertain&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; forces you to deal with uncertainty as a first-class concept
              rather than pretending it doesn’t exist.
              And in doing so, you end up with much smarter code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quote Alan Kay:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Point of view is worth 80 IQ points Alan Kay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we dive deeper into probability distributions, let’s take a detour to Monaco and talk about Monte Carlo sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Monte Carlo Method&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behold, a classic slot machine (or “fruit machine” for our UK readers 🇬🇧):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;enum Slot&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should we play it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we could work out these probabilities analytically — counting combinations, calculating conditional probabilities, maybe even busting out some combinatorics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or we could just let the computer pull the lever a bunch and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let expected&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least we know one thing for certain: The house always wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Beyond Simple Distributions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While one-armed bandits demonstrate pure randomness, real-world applications often deal with more predictable uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Uncertain&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; provides a
              rich set of probability distributions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Modeling sensor noise
let raw&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Uncertain&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; also provides comprehensive
            statistical operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Basic statistics
let temperature = Uncertain.normal(mean: 23.0, standard&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The statistics are computed through sampling. The number of samples is configurable, letting you trade computation time for accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Putting Theory to Practice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users don’t notice when things work correctly, but they definitely notice impossible behavior. When your running app claims they just sprinted at 45 mph, or your IRL meetup app shows someone 500 feet away when GPS accuracy is ±1000 meters, that’s a bad look 🤡&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where do we go from here? Let’s channel our Senior+ memes from before for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Staff engineer saying “let’s ship it and iterate” is right about the incremental approach. You can migrate uncertain calculations piecemeal rather than rewriting everything at once:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;extension CLLocation {
    var uncertain: Uncertain&amp;lt;CLLocation&amp;gt; {
        Uncertain&amp;lt;CLLocation&amp;gt;.from(self)
    }
}

// Gradually migrate critical paths
let is&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we should consider the Principal engineer’s warning of “that won’t scale”. Sampling has a cost, and you should understand the computational overhead for probabilistic accuracy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Fast approximation for UI updates
let quick&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start small. Pick one feature where GPS glitches cause user complaints. Replace your distance calculations with uncertain versions. Measure the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: the goal isn’t to eliminate uncertainty — it’s to acknowledge that it exists and handle it gracefully. Because in the real world, nothing is certain except uncertainty itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And perhaps, with better tools, we can finally stop pretending otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers have given people a taste of superhuman vision after creating contact lenses that allow them to see infrared light, a band of the electromagnetic spectrum that is invisible to the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike night vision goggles, the contact lenses need no power source, and because they are transparent, wearers can see infrared and all the normal visible colours of light at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prof Tian Xue, a neuroscientist at the University of Science and Technology of China, said the work paved the way for a range of contact lenses, glasses and other wearable devices that give people “super-vision”. The technology could also help people with colour blindness, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lenses are the latest breakthrough driven by the team’s desire to extend human vision beyond its natural, narrow range. The wavelengths of light that humans can see make up less than one hundredth of a per cent of the electromagnetic spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Yuqian Ma, a researcher on the project, said: “Over half of the solar radiation energy, existing as infrared light, remains imperceptible to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rainbow of colours visible to humans spans wavelengths from 400 to 700 nanometres (a nanometre is a millionth of a millimetre). But many other animals sense the world differently. Birds, bees, reindeer and mice can see ultraviolet light, wavelengths too short for humans to perceive. Meanwhile, some snakes and vampire bats have organs that detect far-infrared, or thermal radiation, which helps them hunt for prey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To extend humans’ range of vision and enhance our experience of the world, the scientists developed what are called upconversion nanoparticles. The particles absorb infrared light and re-emit it as visible light. For the study, the scientists chose particles that absorb near-infrared light, comprising wavelengths that are just too long for humans to perceive, and converted it into visible red, green or blue light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In previous work, the research team gave mice near-infrared vision by injecting upconversion nanoparticles under the retina, the light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye. But noting that this “may not be readily accepted by humans,” they searched for a less invasive strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing in the journal Cell, the scientists describe how they made soft contact lenses seeded with upconversion nanoparticles. When worn, people could see Morse code-like signals flashed from an infrared LED and tell what direction infrared light came from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their infrared vision improved when they closed their eyes, because eyelids block visible light more than infrared, so there was less visible light to interfere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lenses are not sensitive enough to see natural low levels of infrared light, and because warm objects radiate mostly in the far-infrared, the lenses do not provide thermal vision. But future work will focus on making lenses that are more effective, the scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xue said: “If materials scientists can develop upconversion nanoparticles with higher efficiency, it may become possible to see surrounding infrared light using contact lenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even without full infrared vision, Xue sees applications. For example, secret messages sent by infrared light would only be visible to people wearing the contact lenses, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar approach might help people with colour blindness by converting wavelengths they cannot see into hues they can.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

At $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!3.17$ au we derive $3\sigma$ limits of $Q({\rm OH})&amp;lt;7.76\times10^{23}\ {\rm s^{-1}}$, but find no indications for [O I], C$_2$, C$_3$ or NH$_2$. We report detection of CN emission and also detect numerous Ni I lines while Fe I remains undetected, potentially implying efficiently released gas-phase Ni. From our latest X-shooter measurements conducted on 2025-08-21 ($r_{\rm h} = 2.85$\,au) we measure production rates of $\log~Q(\mathrm{CN}) = 23.61\pm 0.05$ molecules s$^{-1}$ and $\log~Q$(Ni) $= 22.67\pm0.07$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and characterize their evolution as the comet approaches perihelion. We observe a steep heliocentric-distance scaling for the production rates $Q(\mathrm{Ni}) \propto r_h^{-8.43 \pm 0.79}$ and for $Q(\mathrm{CN}) \propto r_h^{-9.38 \pm 1.2}$, and predict a Ni-CO$_{(2)}$ correlation if the Ni I emission is driven by the carbonyl formation channel. Energetic considerations of activation barriers show that this behavior is inconsistent with direct sublimation of canonical metal/sulfide phases and instead favors low-activation-energy release from dust, e.g. photon-stimulated desorption or mild thermolysis of metalated organics or Ni-rich nanophases, possibly including Ni-carbonyl-like complexes. These hypotheses are testable with future coordinated ground-based and space-based monitoring as 3I becomes more active during its continued passage through the solar system.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;astro-ph.SR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Change to browse by: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Building your own CLI Coding Agent with Pydantic-AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learning by doing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CLI coding agents are a fundamentally different tool to chatbots or autocomplete tools - they're agents that can read code, run tests, and update a codebase. While commercial tools are impressive, they don't understand the particular context of our environment and the eccentricities of our specific project. Instead we can build our own coding agent by assembling open source tools, using our specific development standards for: testing, documentation production, code reasoning, and file system operations.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;What We Learned About CLI Agents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The wave of CLI Coding Agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have tried Claude Code, Gemini Code, Open Code or Simon Willison’s LLM CLI, you’ve experienced something fundamentally different from ChatGPT or Github Copilot. These aren’t just chatbots or autocomplete tools - they’re agents that can read your code, run your tests, search docs and make changes to your codebase async.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But how do they work? For me the best way to understand how any tool works is to try and build it myself. So that’s exactly what we did, and in this article I’ll take you through how we built our own CLI Coding Agent using the Pydantic-AI framework and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You’ll see not just how to assemble the pieces but why each capability matters and how it changes the way you can work with code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our implementation leverages AWS Bedrock but with Pydantic-AI you could easily use any other mainstream provider or even a fully local LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Build When You Can Buy?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before diving into the technical implementation, let's examine why we chose to build our own solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer became clear very quickly using our custom agent, while commercial tools are impressive, they’re built for general use cases. Our agent was fully customised to our internal context and all the little eccentricities of our specific project. More importantly, building it gave us insights into how these systems work and the quality of our own GenAI Platform and Dev Tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of it like learning to cook. You can eat at restaurants forever but understanding how flavours combine and techniques work makes you appreciate food differently - and lets you create exactly what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Architecture of Our Development Agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a high level, our coding assistant consists of several key components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Core AI Model: Claude from Anthropic accessed through AWS Bedrock&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pydantic-AI Framework: provides the agent framework and many helpful utilities to make our Agent more useful immediately&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP Servers: independent processes that give the agent specialised tools, MCP is a common standard for defining the servers that contain these tools.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CLI Interface: how users interact with the assistant&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The magic happens through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows the AI model to use various tools through a standardized interface. This architecture makes our assistant highly extensible - we can easily add new capabilities by implementing additional MCP servers, but we’re getting ahead of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Starting Simple: The Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started by creating a basic project structure and installing the necessary dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;uv init uv add pydantic_ai uv add boto3&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our primary dependencies include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pydantic-ai&lt;/code&gt;: Framework for building AI agents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;boto3&lt;/code&gt;: For AWS API interactions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We chose Claude Sonnet 4 from Anthropic (accessed via AWS Bedrock) as our foundation model due to its strong code understanding and generation capabilities. Here's how we configured it in our &lt;code&gt;main.py&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;import boto3 from pydantic_ai import Agent from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio from pydantic_ai.models.bedrock import BedrockConverseModel from pydantic_ai.providers.bedrock import BedrockProvider&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;bedrock_config = BotocoreConfig( read_timeout=300, connect_timeout=60, retries={"max_attempts": 3}, ) bedrock_client = boto3.client( "bedrock-runtime", region_name="eu-central-1", config=bedrock_config ) model = BedrockConverseModel( "eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0", provider=BedrockProvider(bedrock_client=bedrock_client), ) agent = Agent( model=model, )&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;if __name__ == "__main__": agent.to_cli_sync()&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this stage we already have a fully working CLI with a chat interface which we can use as you would a GUI chat interface, which is pretty cool for how little code this is! However we can definitely improve upon this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First Capability: Testing!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of running the tests ourselves after each coding iteration why not get the agent to do it? Seems simple right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;import subprocess&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;@agent.tool_plain() def run_unit_tests() -&amp;gt; str: """Run unit tests using uv.""" result = subprocess.run( ["uv", "run", "pytest", "-xvs", "tests/"], capture_output=True, text=True ) return result.stdout&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we use the same pytest command you would run in the terminal (I’ve shortened ours for the article). Now something magical happened. I could say “X isn’t working” and the agent would:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1. Run the test suite&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2. Identify which specific tests were failing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3. Analyze the error messages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4. Suggest targeted fixes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow change: Instead of staring at test failures or copy pasting terminal outputs into ChatGPT we now give our agent super relevant context about any issues in our codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However we noticed our agent sometimes “fixed” failing tests by suggesting changes to the tests, not the actual implementation. This led to our next addition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding Intelligence: Instructions and intent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We realised we needed to teach our agent a little more about our development philosophy and steer it away from bad behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;instructions = """ You are a specialised agent for maintaining and developing the XXXXXX codebase. ## Development Guidelines: 1. **Test Failures:** - When tests fail, fix the implementation first, not the tests - Tests represent expected behavior; implementation should conform to tests - Only modify tests if they clearly don't match specifications 2. **Code Changes:** - Make the smallest possible changes to fix issues - Focus on fixing the specific problem rather than rewriting large portions - Add unit tests for all new functionality before implementing it 3. **Best Practices:** - Keep functions small with a single responsibility - Implement proper error handling with appropriate exceptions - Be mindful of configuration dependencies in tests Remember to examine test failure messages carefully to understand the root cause before making any changes. """&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;agent = Agent( instructions=instructions, model=model, )&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow change: The agent now understands our values around Test Driven Development and minimal changes. It stopped suggesting large refactors where a small fix would do (Mostly).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now while we could continue building everything from absolute scratch and tweaking our prompts for days we want to go fast and use some tools other people have built - Enter Model Context Protocol (MCP).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The MCP Revolution: Pluggable Capabilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where our agent transformed from a helpful assistant to something approaching the commercial CLI agents. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows us to add sophisticated capabilities by running specialized servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can run these servers as a local process, so no data sharing, where we interact with STDIN/STDOUT to keep things simple and local. (More details on tools and MCP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sandboxed Python Execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using large language models to do calculations or executing arbitrary code they create is not effective and potentially very dangerous! To make our Agent more accurate and safe our first MCP addition was Pydantic Al’s default server for sandboxed Python code execution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;run_python = MCPServerStdio( "deno", args=[ "run", "-N", "-R=node_modules", "-W=node_modules", "--node-modules-dir=auto", "jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python", "stdio", ], )&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;agent = Agent( ... mcp_servers=[ run_python ], )&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gave our agent a sandbox where it could test ideas, prototype solutions, and verify its own suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: This is very different from running the tests where we need the local environment and is intended to be used to make calculations much more robust. This is because writing the code to output a number and then executing that code is much more reliable and understandable, scalable and repeatable than just generating the next token in a calculation. We have seen from frontier labs (including their leaked instructions) that this is a much better approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow change: Doing calculations, even more complex ones, became significantly more reliable. This is useful for many things like dates, sums, counts etc. It also allows for a rapid iteration cycle of simple python code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Up-to-Date library Documentation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are mostly trained in batch on historical data this gives a fixed cutoff while languages and dependencies continue to change and improve so we added Context7 for access to up to date python library documentation in LLM consumable format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;context7 = MCPServerStdio( command="npx", args=["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"], tool_prefix="context" )&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow change: When working with newer libraries or trying to use advanced features, the agent could look up current documentation rather than relying on potentially outdated training data. This made it much more reliable for real-world development work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AWS MCPs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since this particular agent was built with an AWS platform in mind, we added the AWS Labs MCP servers for comprehensive cloud docs and integration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;awslabs = MCPServerStdio( command="uvx", args=["awslabs.core-mcp-server@latest"], env={"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"}, tool_prefix="awslabs", ) aws_docs = MCPServerStdio( command="uvx", args=["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"], env={"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR", "AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION": "aws"}, tool_prefix="aws_docs", )&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow change: Now when I mentioned âBedrock is timing outâ or âthe model responses are getting truncated,â the agent could directly access AWS documentation to help troubleshoot configuration issues. While we've only scratched the surface with these two servers, this is the tip of the iceberg—the AWS Labs MCP collection includes servers for CloudWatch metrics, Lambda debugging, IAM policy analysis, and much more. Even with just documentation access, cloud debugging became more conversational and contextual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Internet Search for Current Information&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need information that's not in any documentation—recent Stack Overflow discussions, GitHub issues, or the latest best practices. We added general internet search:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;internet_search = MCPServerStdio(command="uvx", args=["duckduckgo-mcp-server"])&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow change: When encountering obscure errors or needing to understand recent changes in the ecosystem, the agent could search for current discussions and solutions. This was particularly valuable for debugging deployment issues or understanding breaking changes in dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Structured Problem Solving&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable additions was the code reasoning MCP, which helps the agent think through complex problems systematically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;code_reasoning = MCPServerStdio( command="npx", args=["-y", "@mettamatt/code-reasoning"], tool_prefix="code_reasoning", )&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow change: Instead of jumping to solutions, the agent would break down complex problems into logical steps, explore alternative approaches, and explain its reasoning. This was invaluable for architectural decisions and debugging complex issues. I could ask âWhy is this API call failing intermittently?â and get a structured analysis of potential causes rather than just guesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Optimising for Reasoning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we added more sophisticated capabilities, we noticed that reasoning and analysis tasks often took much longer than regular text generation—especially when the output wasn't correctly formatted on the first try. We adjusted our Bedrock configuration to be more patient:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;bedrock_config = BotocoreConfig( read_timeout=300, connect_timeout=60, retries={"max_attempts": 3}, ) bedrock_client = boto3.client( "bedrock-runtime", region_name="eu-central-1", config=bedrock_config )&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow change: The longer timeouts meant our agent could work through complex problems without timing out. When analyzing large codebases or reasoning through intricate architectural decisions, the agent could take the time needed to provide thorough, well-reasoned responses rather than rushing to incomplete solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Desktop Commander: Warning! With great power comes great responsibility!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, our agent was already quite capable—it could reason through problems, execute code, search for information, and access AWS documentation. This MCP server transforms your agent from a helpful assistant into something that can actually do things in your development environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;desktop_commander = MCPServerStdio( command="npx", args=["-y", "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"], tool_prefix="desktop_commander", )&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Desktop Commander provides an incredibly comprehensive toolkit: file system operations (read, write, search), terminal command execution with process management, surgical code editing with &lt;code&gt;edit_block&lt;/code&gt;, and even
      interactive REPL sessions. It's built on top of the MCP Filesystem Server
      but adds crucial capabilities like search-and-replace editing and
      intelligent process control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow change: This is where everything came together. I could now say âThe authentication tests are failing, please fix the issueâ and the agent would:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1. Run the test suite to see the specific failures&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2. Read the failing test files to understand what was expected&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3. Examine the authentication module code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4. Search the codebase for related patterns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5. Look up the documentation for the relevant library&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;6. Make edits to fix the implementation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;7. Re-run the tests to verify the fix&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8. Search for similar patterns elsewhere that might need updating&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this happened in a single conversation thread, with the agent maintaining context throughout. It wasn't just generating code suggestions—it was actively debugging, editing, and verifying fixes like a pair programming partner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The security model is thoughtful too, with configurable allowed directories, blocked commands, and proper permission boundaries. You can learn more about its extensive capabilities at the Desktop Commander documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Complete System&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's our final agent configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;import asyncio import subprocess import boto3 from pydantic_ai import Agent from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio from pydantic_ai.models.bedrock import BedrockConverseModel from pydantic_ai.providers.bedrock import BedrockProvider from botocore.config import Config as BotocoreConfig bedrock_config = BotocoreConfig( read_timeout=300, connect_timeout=60, retries={"max_attempts": 3}, ) bedrock_client = boto3.client( "bedrock-runtime", region_name="eu-central-1", config=bedrock_config ) model = BedrockConverseModel( "eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0", provider=BedrockProvider(bedrock_client=bedrock_client), ) agent = Agent( model=model, ) instructions = """ You are a specialised agent for maintaining and developing the XXXXXX codebase. ## Development Guidelines: 1. **Test Failures:** - When tests fail, fix the implementation first, not the tests - Tests represent expected behavior; implementation should conform to tests - Only modify tests if they clearly don't match specifications 2. **Code Changes:** - Make the smallest possible changes to fix issues - Focus on fixing the specific problem rather than rewriting large portions - Add unit tests for all new functionality before implementing it 3. **Best Practices:** - Keep functions small with a single responsibility - Implement proper error handling with appropriate exceptions - Be mindful of configuration dependencies in tests Remember to examine test failure messages carefully to understand the root cause before making any changes. """ run_python = MCPServerStdio( "deno", args=[ "run", "-N", "-R=node_modules", "-W=node_modules", "--node-modules-dir=auto", "jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python", "stdio", ], ) internet_search = MCPServerStdio(command="uvx", args=["duckduckgo-mcp-server"]) code_reasoning = MCPServerStdio( command="npx", args=["-y", "@mettamatt/code-reasoning"], tool_prefix="code_reasoning", ) desktop_commander = MCPServerStdio( command="npx", args=["-y", "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"], tool_prefix="desktop_commander", ) awslabs = MCPServerStdio( command="uvx", args=["awslabs.core-mcp-server@latest"], env={"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"}, tool_prefix="awslabs", ) aws_docs = MCPServerStdio( command="uvx", args=["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"], env={"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR", "AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION": "aws"}, tool_prefix="aws_docs", ) context7 = MCPServerStdio( command="npx", args=["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"], tool_prefix="context" ) agent = Agent( instructions=instructions, model=model, mcp_servers=[ run_python, internet_search, code_reasoning, context7, awslabs, aws_docs, desktop_commander, ], ) @agent.tool_plain() def run_unit_tests() -&amp;gt; str: """Run unit tests using uv.""" result = subprocess.run( ["uv", "run", "pytest", "-xvs", "tests/"], capture_output=True, text=True ) return result.stdout async def main(): async with agent.run_mcp_servers(): await agent.to_cli() if __name__ == "__main__": asyncio.run(main())&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How it changes our workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debugging becomes collaborative: you have an intelligent partner that can analyze error messages, suggest hypotheses, and help test solutions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learning accelerates: when working with unfamiliar libraries or patterns, the agent can explain existing code, suggest improvements, and teach you why certain approaches work better.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Context switching reduces: rather than jumping between documentation, Stack Overflow, AWS Console, and your IDE, you have a single interface that can access all these resources while maintaining context about your specific problem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Problem-solving becomes structured: rather than jumping to solutions, the agent can break down complex issues into logical steps, explore alternatives, and explain its reasoning. Like having a real life talking rubber duck!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code review improves: the agent can review your changes, spot potential issues, and suggest improvements before you commit—like having a senior developer looking over your shoulder.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What We Learned About CLI Agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building our own agent revealed several insights about this emerging paradigm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP is (almost) all you need: the magic isn't in any single capability, but in how they work together. The agent that can run tests, read files, search documentation, execute code, access AWS services, and reason through problems systematically becomes qualitatively different from one that can only do any single task.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Current information is crucial: having access to real-time search and up-to-date documentation makes the agent much more reliable for real-world development work where training data might be outdated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Structured thinking matters: the code reasoning capability transforms the agent from a clever autocomplete into a thinking partner that can break down complex problems and explore alternative solutions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Context is king: commercial agents like Claude Code are impressive partly because they maintain context across all these different tools. Your agent needs to remember what it learned from the test run when it's making file changes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Specialisation matters: our agent works better for our specific codebase than general-purpose tools because it understands our patterns, conventions, and tool preferences. If it falls short in any area then we can go and make the required changes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CLI agent paradigm is still evolving rapidly. Some areas we're exploring:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AWS-specific tooling: the AWS Labs MCP servers (https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/) provide incredible depth for cloud-native development—from CloudWatch metrics to Lambda debugging to IAM policy analysis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Workflow Enhancements: teaching the agent our common development workflows so it can handle routine tasks end-to-end. Connecting the agent to our project management tools so it can understand priorities and coordinate with team processes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Benchmarking: Terminal Bench looks like a great dataset and leaderboard to test this toy agent against the big boys!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CLI coding agents represent a fundamental shift from AI as a writing assistant to AI as a development partner. Unlike Copilot's autocomplete or ChatGPT's Q&amp;amp;A, these agents can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Understand your entire project context&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Execute tasks across multiple tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maintain state across complex workflows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learn from your specific codebase and patterns&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building one yourself—even a simple version—gives you insights into where this technology is heading and how to make the most of commercial tools when they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of software development isn't just about writing code faster. It's about having an intelligent partner that understands your goals, your constraints, and your codebase well enough to help you think through problems and implement solutions collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the best way to understand that future? Build it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Significant Revisions&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Some thoughts on LLMs and Software Development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâm about to head away from looking after this site for a few weeks (part vacation, part work stuff). As I contemplate some weeks away from the daily routine, I feel an urge to share some scattered thoughts about the state of LLMs and AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve seen a few early surveys on the effect AI is having on software development, is it really speeding folks up, does it improve or wreck code quality? One of the big problems with these surveys is that they arenât taking into account how people are using the LLMs. From what I can tell the vast majority of LLM usage is fancy auto-complete, often using co-pilot. But those I know who get the most value from LLMs reckon that auto-complete isnât very useful, preferring approaches that allow the LLM to directly read and edit source code files to carry out tasks. My concern is that surveys that ignore the different work-flows of using LLMs will produce data thatâs going to send people down the wrong paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Another complication is the varying capabilities of different models.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâm often asked, âwhat is the future of programming?â Should people consider entering software development now? Will LLMs eliminate the need for junior engineers? Should senior engineers get out of the profession before itâs too late? My answer to all these questions is âI havenât the foggiestâ. Furthermore I think anyone who says they know what this future will be is talking from an inappropriate orifice. We are still figuring out how to use LLMs, and it will be some time before we have a decent idea of how to use them well, especially if they gain significant improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I suggest, is that people experiment with them. At the least, read about what others are doing, but pay attention to the details of their workflows. Preferably experiment yourself, and do share your experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâm also asked: âis AI a bubbleâ? To which my answer is âOF COURSE ITâS A BUBBLEâ. All major technological advances have come with economic bubbles, from canals and railroads to the internet. We know with near 100% certainty that this bubble will pop, causing lots of investments to fizzle to nothing. However what we donât know is when it will pop, and thus how big the bubble will have grown, generating some real value in the process, before that happens. It could pop next month, or not for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also know that when the bubble pops, many firms will go bust, but not all. When the dot-com bubble burst, it killed pets.com, it killed Webvanâ¦ but it did not kill Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I retired from public speaking a couple of years ago. But while I donât miss the stress of giving talks, I do miss hanging out with my friends in the industry. So Iâm looking forward to catching up with many of them at GOTO Copenhagen. Iâve been involved with the GOTO conference series since the 1990s (when it was called JAOO), and continue to be impressed with how they put together a fascinating program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â¢Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My former colleague Rebecca Parsons, has been saying for a long time that hallucinations arenât a bug of LLMs, they are a feature. Indeed they are the feature. All an LLM does is produce hallucinations, itâs just that we find some of them useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the consequences of this is that we should always consider asking the LLM the same question more than once, perhaps with some variation in the wording. Then we can compare answers, indeed perhaps ask the LLM to compare answers for us. The difference in the answers can be as useful as the answers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Certainly if we ever ask a hallucination engine for a numeric answer, we should ask it at least three times, so we get some sense of the variation. Furthermore we shouldnât ask an LLM to calculate an answer than we can calculate deterministically (yes, Iâve seen this). It is OK to ask an LLM to generate code to calculate an answer (but still do it more than once).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other forms of engineering have to take into account the variability of the world. A structural engineer builds in tolerance for all the factors she canât measure. (I remember being told early in my career that the unique characteristic of digital electronics was that there was no concept of tolerances.) Process engineers consider that humans are executing tasks, and will sometimes be forgetful or careless. Software Engineering is unusual in that it works with deterministic machines. Maybe LLMs mark the point where we join our engineering peers in a world on non-determinism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve often heard, with decent reason, an LLM compared to a junior colleague. But I find LLMs are quite happy to say âall tests greenâ, yet when I run them, there are failures. If that was a junior engineerâs behavior, how long would it be before H.R. was involved?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs create a huge increase in the attack surface of software systems. Simon Willison described the The Lethal Trifecta for AI agents: an agent that combines access to your private data, exposure to untrusted content, and a way to externally communicate (âexfiltrationâ). That âuntrusted contentâ can come in all sorts of ways, ask it to read a web page, and an attacker can easily put instructions on the website in 1pt white-on-white font to trick the gullible LLM to obtain that private data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is particularly serious when it comes to agents acting in a browser. Read an attackerâs web page, and it could trick the agent to go to your bank account in another tab and âbuy you a presentâ by transferring your balance to the kind attacker. Willisonâs view is that âthe entire concept of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safelyâ.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Engineers send quantum signals with standard Internet Protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Sadie Harley&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;scientific editor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Robert Egan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;associate editor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a first-of-its-kind experiment, engineers at the University of Pennsylvania brought quantum networking out of the lab and onto commercial fiber-optic cables using the same Internet Protocol (IP) that powers today's web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reported in Science, the work shows that fragile quantum signals can run on the same infrastructure that carries everyday online traffic. The team tested their approach on Verizon's campus fiber-optic network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Penn team's tiny "Q-chip" coordinates quantum and classical data and, crucially, speaks the same language as the modern web. That approach could pave the way for a future "quantum internet," which scientists believe may one day be as transformative as the dawn of the online era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantum signals rely on pairs of "entangled" particles, so closely linked that changing one instantly affects the other. Harnessing that property could allow quantum computers to link up and pool their processing power, enabling advances like faster, more energy-efficient AI or designing new drugs and materials beyond the reach of today's supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Penn's work shows, for the first time on live commercial fiber, that a chip can not only send quantum signals but also automatically correct for noise, bundle quantum and classical data into standard internet-style packets, and route them using the same addressing system and management tools that connect everyday devices online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"By showing an integrated chip can manage quantum signals on a live commercial network like Verizon's, and do so using the same protocols that run the classical internet, we've taken a key step toward larger-scale experiments and a practical quantum internet," says Liang Feng, Professor in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) and in Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE), and the Science paper's senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The challenges of scaling the quantum internet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Erwin Schrodinger, who coined the term "quantum entanglement," famously related the concept to a cat hidden in a box. If the lid is closed, and the box also contains radioactive material, the cat could be alive or dead. One way to interpret the situation is that the cat is both alive and dead. Only opening the box confirms the cat's state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That paradox is roughly analogous to the unique nature of quantum particles. Once measured, they lose their unusual properties, which makes scaling a quantum network extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Normal networks measure data to guide it towards the ultimate destination," says Robert Broberg, a doctoral student in ESE and co-author of the paper. "With purely quantum networks, you can't do that, because measuring the particles destroys the quantum state."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Coordinating classical and quantum signals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get around this obstacle, the team developed the "Q-Chip" (short for "Quantum-Classical Hybrid Internet by Photonics") to coordinate "classical" signals, made of regular streams of light, and quantum particles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The classical signal travels just ahead of the quantum signal," says Yichi Zhang, a doctoral student in MSE and the paper's first author. "That allows us to measure the classical signal for routing, while leaving the quantum signal intact."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In essence, the new system works like a railway, pairing regular light locomotives with quantum cargo. "The classical 'header' acts like the train's engine, while the quantum information rides behind in sealed containers," says Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"You can't open the containers without destroying what's inside, but the engine ensures the whole train gets where it needs to go."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the classical header can be measured, the entire system can follow the same "IP" or "Internet Protocol" that governs today's internet traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"By embedding quantum information in the familiar IP framework, we showed that a quantum internet could literally speak the same language as the classical one," says Zhang. "That compatibility is key to scaling using existing infrastructure."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adapting quantum technology to the real world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges to transmitting quantum particles on commercial infrastructure is the variability of real-world transmission lines. Unlike laboratory environments, which can maintain ideal conditions, commercial networks frequently encounter changes in temperature, thanks to weather, as well as vibrations from human activities like construction and transportation, not to mention seismic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To counteract this, the researchers developed an error-correction method that takes advantage of the fact that interference to the classical header will affect the quantum signal in a similar fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Because we can measure the classical signal without damaging the quantum one," says Feng, "we can infer what corrections need to be made to the quantum signal without ever measuring it, preserving the quantum state."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In testing, the system maintained transmission fidelities above 97%, showing that it could overcome the noise and instability that usually destroy quantum signals outside the lab. And because the chip is made of silicon and fabricated using established techniques, it could be mass-produced, making the new approach easy to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our network has just one server and one node, connecting two buildings, with about a kilometer of fiber-optic cable installed by Verizon between them," says Feng. "But all you need to do to expand the network is fabricate more chips and connect them to Philadelphia's existing fiber-optic cables."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The future of the quantum internet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main barrier to scaling quantum networks beyond a metro area is that quantum signals cannot yet be amplified without destroying their entanglement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some teams have shown that "quantum keys," special codes for ultra-secure communication, can travel long distances over ordinary fiber, those systems use weak coherent light to generate random numbers that cannot be copied, a technique that is highly effective for security applications but not sufficient to link actual quantum processors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overcoming this challenge will require new devices, but the Penn study provides an important early step: showing how a chip can run quantum signals over existing commercial fiber using internet-style packet routing, dynamic switching and on-chip error mitigation that work with the same protocols that manage today's networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This feels like the early days of the classical internet in the 1990s, when universities first connected their networks," says Broberg. "That opened the door to transformations no one could have predicted. A quantum internet has the same potential."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My Startup Banking Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a relatively new member of adult society, and an absolute infant of the business world, I didn't think much about bank choice. I figured: you put money in, you take money out, they're all the same. I also figured a local branch of a global bank is just a fungible tentacle of the giant banking machine, so also... who cares. Both incorrect assumptions, but let's relive and rediscover the effect of these assumptions as I did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I start my company. I am a 22 year old recent college graduate living in San Francisco and pursuing the startup dream. I file my incorporation paperwork and wait to receive the necessary information for one of the first steps in the life of any new business: opening a bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My filing is processed and I receive my EIN while visiting my parents in a suburb of Los Angeles. I have time to kill during one of the days so I drive down to the nearest Chase bank branch and open a business banking account. We'll call the person who helped me at the local branch Alex (this will be important later). I fund that account with a $20,000 personal loan which was almost all of my savings. I get an account number, an online login, and boom, we're in business!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 6 months later, I raise a ~$1M seed round. I supply my Chase business banking account information for the wire, and at close the funding is wired to the account. I am sitting in a cafe in downtown San Francisco and I receive a call from an unknown number -- it's Alex, the banker that helped me open my account. He is being very casual, sort of like "Hey, just wanted to check on things." "I noticed a big deposit and wanted to make sure you had everything you needed." etc. For my side, I am mostly confused: why is this person calling me? I mostly say things like "yes yes I'm fine" and end the call quickly. Some wheels have started turning in Southern California, and I just hadn't known it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone out there is probably mentally screaming at me "you fool!" at this point. With hindsight, I agree, but I will remind you dear reader that I have only been legally allowed to purchase alcohol for just over a year at this point in my life in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two years since 2012 -- from a banking perspective -- are quiet. Alex doesn't call me again, and we have no changes in our banking setup. For two years, the company was in heads-down building mode. We had shown significant product traction and were now ready to ramp up hiring to continue building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of 2014, we raise a $10.2M series A. I once again provide the same Chase business banking account and when the round closes, the funds are wired. Surprise surprise, Alex calls me! I'm starting to realize banks get an alert when there are major changes in account balances. Regardless, I once again brush Alex off -- "everything is good thanks! bye!" -- and continue on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, I am bewildered that this guy I met at the random local branch to sign some papers is the one calling me, but didn't think much more of it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again, the two years since 2014 are mostly quiet from a banking perspective. Alex called more regularly to "check in" but otherwise nothing has changed. We still bank with Chase. I still have never gone back into a branch. I do everything online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2016, we raise a $24M series B. I once again provide the same Chase business banking account and when the round closes, the funds are wired. Again, Alex calls. Again, I brush him off. The bank is where I plant money, I don't need anyone calling me. I just want to focus on building the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout 2016, we had been building out an executive team for the company. And around the same time of the funding, we hire a Vice President of Finance. As he gets up to speed with our financial footing, he notices we have ~$35M sitting in cash in a Chase bank account. This is obviously not a smart thing to do, so he suggests some financial plans for how to better safeguard and utilize this mountain of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of these plans, he suggests moving to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). They're local to the Bay Area, he's worked with them before, and their bankers understand startups. It'll make accounts receivables, payables, payroll, etc. easier. To me, a bank is a bank is a bank, and if it helps make his job easier, I support his plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I log into the Chase online portal and initiate a wire for the full account balance to SVB. I have to pay something like a $30 fee to wire $35M (inconsequential to the story, but amusing nonetheless). Someone calls me for verification -- not Alex -- and the wire processes. Boom, we're done with Chase. Or so I think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alex calls me the next day. The day we initiated the wire was his day off. He sounds slightly agitated. I wasn't rude to him, but I was short with him. I switched banks, that's all there is to it. Thanks and goodbye. I never talk to Alex ever again. A bank is a bank is a bank, you put money in, you get money out, I don't understand why I would need to talk to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once again interrupt this story to appeal to the readers who are screaming at me and thank you for joining me on this story recounting my learning journey. Rest assured, at this point in the story, a professional was now in charge of the company's finances. But the decisions of the years leading up to this would have lingering effects for a few more years...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now take a brief detour from the company, because this is where my personal life becomes relevant to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the prior three years, I had been living in Los Angeles. At some point during 2017, I had to go to a local Chase branch to make some changes to my personal accounts. It has been close to a year since the company stopped using Chase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I visit the closest bank branch to my apartment. This bank branch is 20 miles north of where my parents live -- or the area with the branch where I opened the original company business bank accounts. I'm going to Chase for purely personal reasons, but this information is unfortunately relevant to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At my local branch, I walk up to the teller and provide some handwritten information: my name, account number, desired transaction, etc. The teller looks at the paper, then looks at me, then looks back at the paper, then asks "Are you the HashiCorp guy?" What? HashiCorp is doing well but its not at all something a random non-technical consumer would know about. What is going on?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say yes and he acknowledges but doesn't automatically offer any more information. I have to know, so I continue "How do you know that?" His response is "Dude, everyone at Chase down here knows about HashiCorp." Huh?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Up to this point, everything in the story is what I know and experienced first hand. What follows however is now second hand information as told by this teller. I haven't verified it, but other employees (at other branches) have said similar things to me over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The teller proceeds to explain that Alex -- the guy I opened my original company account with -- became a fast rising star in the area. He had opened a business account in a small suburb that grew from $20,000 to $35,000,000 in balances in just four years! Despite the business (my business) not engaging in higher-revenue activities with the bank, the opportunity this account represented to the small business wing of the small suburban branch stirred up some excitement. It was just a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, overnight, the account went to $0. Without talking to anyone, without any prior warning, that account was gone. I used online banking to transfer the entirety of the balance to another bank. The small suburban branch viewed this as a huge loss and Alex came into work with some tough questions and no answers. I instantly recalled feeling that Alex was agitated when he called me the day after the transfer, and I now had an idea of why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know what happened to Alex, the teller said he was "no longer working in the area" and said it with a noticably negative tone. I don't know what this means and I never found out. Perhaps, he just moved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following this event, Chase began an educational series to other local branches in the Los Angeles area explaining that there are these "startups" and how their financial patterns do not match those of a typical business. This series taught branches how to identify startups and how to consider their accounts. The case study they used for this presentation: HashiCorp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has been two years since hiring our VP of Finance and our financial department is in really healthy shape. I still have certain approval rights but no longer directly manage the accounts of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the recent events with Silicon Valley Bank, I feel it's important to mention that at this point of the company, we had already begun diversifying our balances across multiple banks. SVB will not be mentioned again for the remainder of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working at my office at home in Los Angeles and I receive a phone call from our finance department. That's weird, I rarely receive phone calls. They tell me that during a routine internal audit, they realized there are a few customer accounts that are still paying their bill into the old Chase account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never closed that original Chase business account back in 2016. Let me explain how that happens. To close an account, I had to do it in person at any local Chase branch. Startups are busy, the account balance in 2016 was $0, and so I just put it off. Well, a couple years passed, it was still open, and a few customers were actually sending payments to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worse, upon the realization that a few customers were paying into this account, our finance team realized that there was also fraud. For over a year, someone had been wiring thousands of dollars out every few weeks. We were short over $100,000 due to fraud. The finance team immediately called Chase and reported the fraud, locked down the account, and Chase started an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the finance team wanted me to close the account and wire the remaining balance to our actual business bank. With the fraud actively being handled by Chase and the finance team, I take on the task of closing the account. I immediately head to the nearest local Chase branch (once again a branch I've never been to before) and explain the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After waiting for 15 minutes, a manager walks up to me. I know this can't be good. The branch manager explains that due to the actions taken to lock down the account for fraud, electronic transfers are unavailable. It doesn't matter that I'm provably the person who opened the account, electronic transfers are "impossible."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say okay, and ask how I am supposed to close the account and transfer the remaining balance. He said I can close the account and withdraw the remaining balance only in cash. Cash? At this point, I literally asked: "like, green paper money cash?" He says yes. The balance in the account is somewhere around $1M.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spent another two hours at the bank, juggling between calling our finance department, talking to this branch manager, and calling the Chase business phone line. We determine that instead of literal green cash, I can get a cashier's check. But there is a major problem: the amount the cashier's check is made out for has to be available at that local branch (or, whichever branch issues it). And, well, local branches I guess don't usually have $1M cash lying around. Or, if they do, its not enough to cover other business activities for the day so they're not willing to part with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bank manager gives me the phone number of another branch manager that "may be able to help me." He literally writes down a phone number on a piece of paper. This is all feeling so surreal. I call this number and its for a slightly larger branch a few miles down the road. He says "you're the HashiCorp guy right?" And I roll my eyes. My infamy in the area is still well known.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This manager is very helpful, if not a bit gruff. He explains to me that each local branch has some sort of performance metric based on inflows and outflows at the given branch. Therefore, funding a $1M cash withdrawal was not attractive to them. I'm learning a lot in a really condensed period of time at this point. I don't even know if what he's telling me is true, or legal, all I hear is "this is going to be hard to do if you want it all at once."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we do want it all at once. And we want to close the account. Now. He is not happy, but he says he'll call me back in 24 to 48 hours. True to his word, he calls me back the next day. He says that he had to coordinate to ensure his branch had the proper funding to satisfy this transaction, and that the funding would be available at a specific date a few days hence. He said I have to do the withdrawal that day because his branch will not hold that amount in cash for any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He also subtly suggested I hire personal security or otherwise deposit those funds somewhere with haste. I believe his exact words were "if you lose that check, I can't help you." Again, this was a one time event, and I don't know how true that all is, but it was said to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days later, I walk into the branch (I did not hire personal security). I tell the teller my name and there is a flicker of immediate recognition. The teller guides me to a cubicle, the account is successfully closed, I'm issued a $1M cashier's check, and I walk out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My business banking relationship with Chase is, at long last, complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear that Chase could've been an excellent banking partner. I never gave them the chance. I never told them what my business does or what I'd use the money for. I never talked to anyone (besides saying what I needed to get off the phone). This story isn't a cautionary tale about Chase, it is rather recounting my naivete as a young, first-time startup founder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Epilogue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cashier's check was uneventfully deposited into our primary business banking account shortly after I walked out of the Chase branch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fraud investigation took a few months to complete but we were able to recover all of the lost funds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enough time has passed and employees cycled that I'm no longer recognized at any Los Angeles area Chase branches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I look back on these events and there are many places I cringe. At the same time, I can't imagine making different choices because I was acting in good faith at all times with the knowledge I had. I think the choices I made were reasonable for any new founder, and I know many founders who have made similar choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there was no long term negative impact of the events that transpired (except maybe for Alex, but I truly don't know) and I can now look back on it with amusement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
