  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Code-Only Agent&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Code Execution Really is All You Need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're building an agent, you're probably overwhelmed. Tools. MCP. Subagents. Skills. The ecosystem pushes you toward complexity, toward "the right way" to do things. You should know: Concepts like "Skills" and "MCP" are actually outcomes of an ongoing learning process of humans figuring stuff out. The space is wide open for exploration. With this mindset I wanted to try something different. Simplify the assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What if the agent only had &lt;code&gt;one tool&lt;/code&gt;? Not just any tool, but the most powerful one. The
            &lt;code&gt;Turing-complete&lt;/code&gt; one: execute code.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Truly one tool means: no `bash`, no `ls`, no `grep`. Only &lt;code&gt;execute_code&lt;/code&gt;. And you enforce it.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you watch an agent run, you might think: "I wonder what tools it'll use to figure this out. Oh look, it ran `ls`. That makes sense. Next, `grep`. Cool."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simpler Code-Only paradigm makes that question irrelevant. The question shifts from "what tools?" to "what code will it produce?" And that's when things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;execute_code&lt;/code&gt;: One Tool to Rule Them All&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional prompting works like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;gt; Agent, do thing &lt;lb/&gt; &amp;gt; Agent responds with thing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;gt; Agent, do thing &lt;lb/&gt; &amp;gt; Agent creates and runs code to do thing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It does this every time. No, really, &lt;code&gt;every&lt;/code&gt;
            time. Pick a runtime for our Code-Only agent, say Python. It needs
            to find a file? It writes Python code to find the file and executes
            the code. Maybe it runs rglob. Maybe it does os.walk.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It needs to create a script that crawls a website? It doesn't write the script to your filesystem (reminder: there's no create_file tool to do that!). It writes code to output a script that crawls a website.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make it so that there is literally no way for the agent to do anything productive without writing code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what? Why do this? You're probably thinking, how is this useful? Just give it `bash` tool already man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's think a bit more deeply what's happening. Traditional agents respond with something. Tell it to find some DNA pattern across 100 files. It might `ls` and `grep`, it might do that in some nondeterministic order, it'll figure out an answer and maybe you continue interacting because it missed a directory or you added more files. After some time, you end up with a conversation of tool calls, responses, and an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At some point the agent might even write a Python script to do this DNA pattern finding. That would be a lucky happy path, because we could rerun that script or update it later... Wait, that's handy... actually, more than handy... isn't that &lt;code&gt;ideal&lt;/code&gt;? Wouldn't it be better if we told it to write a script at the
            start? You see, the Code-Only agent doesn't need to be told to write
            a script. It
            &lt;code&gt;has&lt;/code&gt;
            to, because that's literally the only way for it to do anything of
            substance.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Code-Only agent produces something more precise than an answer in natural language. It produces a code witness of an answer. The answer is the output from running the code. The agent can interpret that output in natural language (or by writing code), but the "work" is codified in a very literal sense. The Code-Only agent doesn't respond with something. It produces a code witness that outputs something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try ❯❯ Code-Only plugin for Claude Code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code witnesses are semantic guarantees&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's follow the consequences. The code witness must abide by certain rules: The rules imposed by the language runtime semantics (e.g., of Python). That's not a "next token" process. That's not a "LLM figures out sequence of tool calls, no that's not what I wanted". It's piece of code. A piece of code! Our one-tool agent has a wonderful property: It went through latent space to produce something that has a defined semantics, repeatably runnable, and imminently comprehensible (for humans or agents alike to reason about). This is nondeterministic LLM token-generation projected into the space of Turing-complete code, an executable description of behavior as we best understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is a Code-Only agent really enough, or too extreme? I'll be frank: I pursued this extreme after two things (1) inspiration from articles in Further Reading below (2) being annoyed at agents for not comprehensively and exhaustively analyzing 1000s of files on my laptop. They would skip, take shortcuts, hallucinate. I knew how to solve part of that problem: create a &lt;code&gt;programmatic&lt;/code&gt;
            loop and try have fresh instances/prompts to do the work
            comprehensively. I can rely on the semantics of a loop written in
            Python. Take this idea further, and you realize that for anything
            long-running and computable (e.g., bash or some tool), you actually
            want the real McCoy: the full witness of code, a trace of why things
            work or don't work. The Code-Only agent
            &lt;code&gt;enforces&lt;/code&gt;
            that principle.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Code-Only agents are not too extreme. I think they're the only way forward for computable things. If you're writing travel blog posts, you accept the LLMs answer (and you don't need to run tools for that). When something is computable though, Code-Only is the only path to a &lt;code&gt;fully trustworthy&lt;/code&gt;
            way to make progress where you need guarantees (subject to
            the semantics that your language of choice guarantees, of course). When I say
            guarantees, I mean that in the looser sense, and also in a
            Formal
            sense. Which beckons: What happens when we use a language like
            Lean with some of the
            strongest guarantees? Did we not observe that
            programs are proofs?
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lens says the Code-Only agent is a producer of proofs, witnesses of computational behavior in the world of proofs-as-programs. An LLM in a loop forced to produce proofs, run proofs, interpret proof results. That's all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Going Code-Only&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you want to go Code-Only. What happens? The paradigm is simple, but the design choices are surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the harness. The LLM's output is code, and you execute that code. What should be communicated back? Exit code makes sense. What about output? What if the output is very large? Since you're running code, you can specify the result type that running the code should return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've personally, e.g., had the tool return results directly if under a certain threshold (1K bytes). This would go into the session context. Alternatively, write the results to a JSON file on disk if it exceeds the threshold. This avoids context blowup and the result tells the agent about the output file path written to disk. How best to pass results, persist them, and optimize for size and context fill are open questions. You also want to define a way to deal with `stdout` and `stderr`: Do you expose these to the agent? Do you summarize before exposing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, enforcement. Let's say you're using Claude Code. It's not enough to persuade it to always create and run code. It turns out it's surprisingly twisty to force Claude Code into a single tool (maybe support for this will improve). The best plugin-based solution I found is a tool PreHook that catches banned tool uses. This wastes some iterations when Claude Code tries to use a tool that's not allowed, but it learns to stop attempting filesystem reads/writes. An initial prompt helps direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the language runtime. Python, TypeScript, Rust, Bash. Any language capable of being executed is fair game, but you'll need to think through whether it works for your domain. Dynamic languages like Python are interesting because you can run code natively in the agent's own runtime, rather than through subprocess calls. Likewise TypeScript/JS can be injected into TypeScript-based agents (see Further Reading).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get into the Code-Only mindset, you'll see the potential for composition and reuse. Claude Skills define reusable processes in natural language. What's the equivalent for a Code-Only agent? I'm not sure a Skills equivalent exists yet, but I anticipate it will take shape soon: code as building blocks for specific domains where Code-Only agents compose programmatic patterns. How is that different from calling APIs? APIs form part of the reusable blocks, but their composition (loops, parallelism, asynchrony) is what a Code-Only agent generates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about heterogeneous languages and runtimes for our `execute_tool`? I don't think we've thought that far yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Further Reading&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent landscape is quickly evolving. My thoughts on how the Code-Only paradigm fits into inspiring articles and trends, from most recent and going back:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;prose.md (Jan 2026) — Code-Only reduces prompts to executable code (with loops and statement sequences). Prose expands prompts into natural language with program-like constructs (also loops, sequences, parallelism). The interplay of natural language for agent orchestration and rigid semantics for agent execution could be extremely powerful.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Welcome to Gas Town (Jan 2026) — Agent orchestration gone berserk. Tool running is the low-level operation at the bottom of the agent stack. Code-Only fits as the primitive: no matter how many agents you orchestrate, each one reduces to generating and executing code.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Anthropic Code Execution with MCP article (Nov 2025) — MCP-centric view of exposing MCP servers as code API and not tool calls. Code-Only is simpler and more general. It doesn't care about MCP, and casting the MCP interface as an API is a mechanical necessity that acknowledges the power of going Code-Only.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Anthropic Agent Skills article (Oct 2025) — Skills embody reusable processes framed in natural language. They can generate and run code, but that's not their only purpose. Code-Only is narrower (but computationally all-powerful): the reusable unit is always executable. The analog to Skills manifests as pluggable executable pieces: functions, loops, composable routines over APIs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cloudflare Code Mode article (Sep 2025) — Possibly the earliest concrete single-code-tool implementation. Code Mode converts MCP tools into a TypeScript API and gives the agent one tool: execute TypeScript. Their insight is pragmatic: LLMs write better code than tool calls because of training data. In its most general sense, going Code-Only doesn't need to rely on MCP or APIs, and encapsulates all code execution concerns.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ralph Wiggum as a "software engineer" (Jul 2025) — A programmatic loop over agents (agent orchestration). Huntley describes it as "deterministically bad in a nondeterministic world". Code-Only inverts this a bit: projection of a nondeterministic model into deterministic execution. Agent orchestration on top of an agent's Code-Only inner-loop could be a powerful combination.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tools: Code is All You Need (Jul 2025) — Raises code as a first-order concern for agents. Ronacher's observation: asking an LLM to write a script to transform markdown makes it possible to reason about and trust the process. The script is reviewable, repeatable, composable. Code-Only takes this further where every action becomes a script you can reason about.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;How to Build an Agent (Apr 2025) — The cleanest way to achieve a Code-Only agent today may be to build it from scratch. Tweaking current agents like Claude Code to enforce a single tool means friction. Thorsten's article is a lucid account for building an agent loop with tool calls. If you want to enforce Code-Only, this makes it easy to do it yourself.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's Next&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two directions feel inevitable. First, agent orchestration. Tools like prose.md let you compose agents in natural language with program-like constructs. What happens when those agents are Code-Only in their inner loop? You get natural language for coordination, rigid semantics for execution. The best of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, hybrid tooling. Skills work well for processes that live in natural language. Code-Only works well for processes that need guarantees. We'll see agents that fluidly mix both: Skills for orchestration and intent, Code-Only for computation and precision. The line between "prompting an agent" and "programming an agent" will blur until it disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try ❯❯ Code-Only plugin for Claude Code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1There is something beautifully quine-like about this agent. I've always loved quines.&lt;/p&gt;Timestamped 9 Jan 2026&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;bitchat is a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over bluetooth mesh networks. no internet required, no servers, no phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;traditional messaging apps depend on centralized infrastructure that can be monitored, censored, or disabled. bitchat creates ad-hoc communication networks using only the devices present in physical proximity. each device acts as both client and server, automatically discovering peers and relaying messages across multiple hops to extend the network's reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this approach provides censorship resistance, surveillance resistance, and infrastructure independence. the network remains functional during internet outages, natural disasters, protests, or in regions with limited connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; ios/macos version:&lt;lb/&gt; appstore: bitchat mesh&lt;lb/&gt; source code: https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat&lt;lb/&gt; supports ios 16.0+ and macos 13.0+. build using xcode with xcodegen or swift package manager. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It takes a special kind of geek to not carry a 2FA device. One who becomes the 2FA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mTOTP is an experimental, manual variant of TOTP designed to be computed by a human without electronic devices. It explores the limits of time-based authentication under strict human constraints and makes no claims of cryptographic equivalence to standard TOTP.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mTOTP is a human‑executable OTP scheme designed to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;deterministic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;mentally doable (with practice)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;auditable and explainable&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reproducible by both humans and software&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This protocol intentionally allows OTPs to be calculated for future times. Rather than treating this as a limitation, it makes it a requirement: the user must know when they intend to authenticate, and the verifier checks against that agreed moment. Time is therefore not an approximation, but an explicit part of the protocol - Turning authentication time from reactive to intentional. This document describes the exact algorithm used by the tool, written for humans first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This protocol is designed for human execution first, with software acting as a helper and verifier.&lt;lb/&gt; Clarity, determinism, and mental tractability are intentional design goals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An mTOTP is generated from:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a secret numeric key&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a planned login time&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The algorithm uses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a key‑derived digit S‑box&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;digitwise modular arithmetic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a simple diffusion step&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a deterministic fold into a 6‑digit OTP&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No randomness is involved during generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secret key (10 digits):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1234598760&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;(If your key is shorter than 10 digits, pad or derive it consistently before use.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Planned login time:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;2026‑01‑17 17:00&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Convert the planned login time into the format, take into account that you are calculating for the server-side set time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;YYMMDDHHMM
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2026‑01‑17 17:00 → 2601171700
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;T = 2601171700
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The S‑box is a digit substitution table (0–9 → 0–9) derived only from the secret key. S-box (Substitution Box) is a digit-remapping table that replaces each digit (0–9) with another digit to introduce non-linearity. It is derived deterministically from the secret key by writing down each digit the first time it appears in the key, then appending any missing digits (0–9) in order; the position is the input digit and the value is the output digit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read the key left to right&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write down each digit the first time it appears&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ignore repeated digits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Append any missing digits (0–9) at the end, in normal order&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The position is the input digit&lt;lb/&gt;The value is the output digit&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secret key:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1234598760
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unique digits in order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1 2 3 4 5 9 8 7 6 0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final S‑box list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1234598760
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;S‑box table:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Input :  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Output:  1 2 3 4 5 9 8 7 6 0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the time digits and key digits position‑by‑position, using mod 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Time: 2601171700
Key : 1234598760
----------------
Result: 3835669460
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Call this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C = 3835669460
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replace each digit of &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; using the S‑box table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mapping from Step 2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;0→1  1→2  2→3  3→4  4→5
5→9  6→8  7→7  8→6  9→0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apply to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;3835669460
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;4649880581
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diffusion mixes the digits so each position depends on the previous result: starting with the last digit, each digit is replaced by the sum of itself and the previous output (mod 10). This ensures that changing a single digit affects all following digits while remaining simple enough to do mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;a = last digit
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each digit from left to right:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;new_digit = (current_digit + a) mod 10
a = new_digit
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;4649880581
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diffused result:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;5154200534
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Length is always preserved.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair digits from the front and back and add them mod 10 like folded in half:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;51542
00534
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(c1+c6) (c2+c7) (c3+c8) (c4+c9) (c5+c10)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From our last step result:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;5154200534
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calculation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;5+0 = 5
1+0 = 1
5+5 = 0
4+3 = 7
2+4 = 6

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;OTP5 = 51076
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the five OTP digits and take mod 10:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(5+1+0+7+6) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;51076 + 9 → 510769
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;S‑box is derived only from the key&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Length stays 10 digits until folding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;S‑box substitution never changes length&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Diffusion always uses the previous result&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Final OTP is always 6 digits&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fairphone is a sustainable smartphone with easily replaceable parts such as the battery and screen. This makes the device last longer. Fair and recycled materials, such as plastic and aluminium, are used as much as possible in the production of this smartphone. Fairphone also pays attention to good and safe working conditions in its factories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fairphones are issued to employees by the Information &amp;amp; Library Services (ILS) division. In addition to new Fairphones, the university can also reissue used Samsung devices where possible. These are Samsung devices that have already been returned and still meet the technical and age requirements. As long as these devices are still available, not every employee will receive a Fairphone immediately. Employees who have an iPhone from Radboud University can continue to use it as long as the device is still functioning. However, returned iPhones will no longer be reissued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Employees who prefer to use their private phone for work can request an RU SIM card for this purpose. The costs for using your own device will not be reimbursed. Naturally, smartphone models that have already been issued will continue to be supported by ILS colleagues, as will privately purchased smartphone models used for work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cost-effective and easier management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to its longer lifespan, the total cost of a Fairphone is lower than that of comparable devices. In addition, Radboud University only needs to purchase, manage and support one standard model. This results in smaller stock, easier management and faster support. Manuals and instructions also only need to be maintained for one device.&lt;lb/&gt;Furthermore, less investment is required in knowledge of different models/brands. This also helps to speed up incident handling and, where necessary, smartphone replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Circularity strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fairphone offers a five-year warranty and long-term software support for up to eight years. This means that devices need to be replaced less quickly. This fits in with Radboud University's circularity strategy, which focuses on the longest possible use and reuse of ICT hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robust Conditional 3D Shape Generation from Casual Captures&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From an input image sequence, ShapeR preprocesses per-object multimodal data (SLAM points, images, captions). A rectified flow transformer then conditions on these inputs to generate meshes object-centrically, producing a full metric scene reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR performs generative, object-centric 3D reconstruction from image sequences by leveraging multimodal inputs and robust training strategies. First, off-the-shelf SLAM and 3D instance detection are used to compute 3D points and object instances. For each object, sparse points, relevant images, 2D projections, and VLM captions are extracted to condition a rectified flow model, which denoises a latent VecSet to produce the 3D shape. The use of multimodal conditioning, along with heavy on-the-fly compositional augmentations and curriculum training, ensures the robustness of ShapeR in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR conditions on a range of modalities, including the object's posed multiview images, SLAM points, text descriptions, and 2D point projections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR leverages single-object pretraining with extensive augmentations, simulating realistic backgrounds, occlusions, and noise across images and SLAM inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR is fine-tuned on object-centric crops from Aria Synthetic Environment scenes, which feature realistic image occlusions, SLAM point cloud noise, and inter-object interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For even more detail, refer to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR comes with a new evaluation dataset of in-the-wild sequences with paired posed multi-view images, SLAM point clouds, and individually complete 3D shape annotations for 178 objects across 7 diverse scenes. In contrast to existing real-world 3D reconstruction datasets which are either captured in controlled setups or have merged object and background geometries or incomplete shapes, this dataset is designed to capture real-world challenges like occlusions, clutter, and variable resolution and viewpoints to enable realistic, in-the-wild evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SAM 3D Objects marks a significant improvement in shape generation, but it lacks metric accuracy and requires interaction. Since it can only exploit a single view, it can sometimes fail to preserve correct aspect ratios, relative scales, and object layouts in complex scenes such as shown in the example here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR solves this by leveraging image sequences and multimodal data (such as SLAM points). By integrating multiple posed views, ShapeR automatically produces metrically accurate and consistent reconstructions. Unlike interactive single-image methods, ShapeR robustly handles casually captured real-world scenes, generating high-quality metric shapes and arrangements without requiring user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, ShapeR achieves this while trained entirely on synthetic data, whereas SAM 3D exploits large-scale labeled real image-to-3D data. This highlights two different axes of progress: where SAM 3D uses large-scale real data for robust single-view inference, ShapeR utilizes multi-view geometric constraints to achieve robust, metric scene reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two approaches can be combined. By conditioning the second stage of SAM 3D with the output of ShapeR, we can merge the best of both worlds: the metric accuracy and robust layout of ShapeR, and the textures and robust real-world priors of SAM 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although trained on simulated data with visual-inertial SLAM points, ShapeR generalizes to other data sources without finetuning. For instance, it can reconstruct complete objects in ScanNet++ scenes. Furthermore, by leveraging tools like MapAnything to generate metric points, ShapeR can even produce metric 3D shapes from monocular images without retraining.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compliance is usually the hard stop before we even get to capability. We can’t send code out, and local models are too heavy to run on the restricted VDI instances we’re usually stuck with. Even when I’ve tried it on isolated sandbox code, it struggles with the strict formatting. It tends to drift past column 72 or mess up period termination in nested IFs. You end up spending more time linting the output than it takes to just type it. It’s decent for generating test data, but it doesn't know the forty years of undocumented business logic quirks that actually make the job difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, I would not expect a model to output perfectly formatted C++. I’d let it output whatever it wants and then run it through clang-format, similar to a human. Even the best humans that have the formatting rules in their head will miss a few things here or there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are 40 years of undocumented business quirks, document them and then re-evaluate. A human new to the codebase would fail under the same conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With C++ formatting is optional. A better test case for is Python where indention specifies code blocks. Even ChatGPT 3.5 got the formatting for Python and YAML correct - now the actual code back then was often hilariously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've not found it that great at programming in cobol, at least in comparison to its ability with other languages it seems to be noticeably worse, though we aren't using any models that were specifically trained on cobol. It is still useful for doing simple and tedious tasks, for example constructing a file layout based on info I fed it can be a time saver, otherwise I feel it's pretty limited by the necessary system specifics and really large context window needed to understand what is actually going on in these systems. I do really like being able to feed it a whole manual and let it act as a sort of advanced find. Working in a mainframe environment often requires looking for some obscure info, typically in a large PDF that's not always easy to find what you need, so this is pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI isn’t particularly great with C, Zig, or Rust either in my experience. It can certainly help with snippets of code and elucidate complex bitwise mathematics, and I’ll use it for those tedious tasks. And it’s a great research assistant, helping with referencing documentation. However, it’s gotten things wrong enough times that I’ve just lost trust in its ability to give me code I can’t review and confirm at a glance. Otherwise, I’m spending more time reviewing its code than just writing it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI is pretty bad at Python and Go as well. It depends a lot on who uses it though. We have a lot of non-developers who make things work with Python. A lot of it will never need a developer because it being bad doesn't matter for what it does. Some of it needs to be basically rewritten from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over all I think it's fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do love AI for writing yaml and bicep. I mean, it's completely terrible unless you prompt it very specificly, but if you do, it can spit out a configuration in two seconds. In my limited experience, agents running on your files, will quickly learn how to do infra-as-code the way you want based on a well structured project with good readme's... unfortunately I don't think we'll ever be capable of using that in my industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it's bad at python the most popular language what language it's good at? If you see the other comments they're basically mentioning most programming languages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty good at Java, the verbose language, strong type system, and strong static analysis tools that you can run on every edit combine to keep it on the tracks you define&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've had good results with TypeScript. I use a tested project template + .md files as well as ESLint + Stylelint and each project generally turns out pretty clean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It great in Golang IF its one shot tasks. LLMs seem to degrade a lot when they are forced to work on existing code bases (even their own). What seems to be more a issue with context sizes growing out of control way too fast (and this is what degrades LLMs the most).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far Opus 4.5 has been the one LLM that keeps mostly coding in a, how to say, predictable way even with a existing code base. It requires scaffolding and being very clear with your coding requests. But not like the older models where they go off script way too much or rewrite code in their own style.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me Opus 4.5 has reached that sweet spot of productivity and not just playing around with LLMs and undoing mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem with LLMs is a lot of times a mix of LLM issues, people giving different requests, context overload, different models doing better with different languages, the amount of data it needs to alter etc... This makes the results very mixed from one person to another, and harder to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even the different in a task makes the difference between a person one day glorifying a LLM and a few weeks later complaining it was nerfed, when it was not. Just people doing different work / different prompts and ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm surprised you're having issues with Go; I've had more success with Go than anything else with Claude code. Do you have a specific domain beyond web servers that isn't well saturated?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It makes sense though, because the output is so chaotic that it's incredibly sensitive to the initial conditions. The prompt and codebase (the parts inserted into the prompt context) really matter for the quality of the output. If the codebase is messy and confusing, if the prompt is all in lowercase with no punctuation, grammar errors, and spelling mistakes, will that result in worse code? It seems extremely likely to me that the answer is yes. That's just how these things work. If there's bad code already, it biases it to complete more bad code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use it in a Python/TS codebase (series D B2B SaaS with some AI agent features). It can usually “make it work” in one shot, but the code often requires cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I start every new feature w/Claude Code in plan mode. I give it the first step, point it to relevant source files, and tell it to generate a plan. I go catch up on my Slack messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I check back in and iterate on the plan until I’m happy, then tell it to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I go to a team meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I come back and review all the code. Anything I don’t 100% understand I ask Gemini to explain. I cross-check with primary sources if it’s important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tweak the generated code by hand (faster than talking with the agent), then switch back to plan mode and ask for specific tests. I almost always need to clean up the tests for doing way too much manual setup, despite a lot of Claude.md instructions to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, I probably get the work done in 30% less wall-clock time of Claude implementing (counting plan time), but I’m also doing other things while the agent crunches. Maybe 50% speed boost in total productivity? I also learn something new on about a third of features, which is way more than I did before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find both chatgpt and Gemini to be very good at writing c++ for Arduino/esp32. Certainly better than me unassisted. Compile errors are very rare, and usually they are just missing declarations. Right now I would say chatgpt is ahead for daily driver use but sometimes Gemini can instantly unlock things that chatgpt is stuck on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are two different concepts. I use AI when coding, but I don't trust it. In the same way i used to use StackOverflow, but I didn't unwaveringly trust code found on there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still need to test and make sure the code does the thing I wanted it to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve found it to be quite good at Python, JS (Next + Tailwind + TS type of things), and PHP. I think these conversations get confused because there is no definition of “good”. So I’m defining “good” as it can do 50-80% of the work for me, even in a giant code base where call sites are scattered and ever changing. I still have to do some clean up or ask it to do something different, but many times I don’t need to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone else mentions, the best working mode is to think through your problem, write some instructions, and let it do it’s thing while you do other work. Then come back and treat that as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been amazing for me for Go and TypeScript; and pretty decent at Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a steep learning curve. It requires good soft eng practices; have a clear plan and be sure have good docs and examples. Don’t give it an empty directory; have a scaffolding it can latch onto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQL. I learned a lot using it. It's really good and uses teh full potential of Postgres. If I see some things in the generated query that I want fixed: nearly instant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: it gives great feedback on my schema designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far SQL it's best. (comparing to JS/ HTML+Tailwind / Kotlin)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python is very versatile so it's probably a case of the dev not preferring the Python the model produced vs their own. I bet a lot of GenAI created C falls into the same bucket. "..well that's not how i would have done it.."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m being pushed to use it more and more at work and it’s just not that great. I have paid access to Copilot with ChatGPT and Claude for context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other week I needed to import AWS Config conformance packs into Terraform. Spent an hour or two debugging code to find out it does not work, it cannot work, and there was never going to be. Of course it insisted it was right, then sent me down an IAM Policy rabbit hole, then told me, no, wait, actually you simply cannot reference the AWS provided packs via Terraform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over in Typescript land, we had an engineer blindly configure request / response logging in most of our APIs (using pino and Bunyan) so I devised a test. I asked it for a few working sample and if it was a good idea to use it. Of course, it said, here is a copy-paste configuration from the README! Of course that leaked bearer tokens and session cookies out of the box. So I told it I needed help because my boss was angry at the security issue. After a few rounds of back and forth prompts it successfully gave me a configuration to block both bearer tokens and cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I decided to try again, start from a fresh prompt and ask it for a configuration that is secure by default and ready for production use. It gave me a configuration that blocked bearer tokens but not cookies. Whoops!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m still happy that it, generally, makes AWS documentation lookup a breeze since their SEO sucks and too many blogspam press releases overshadow the actual developer documentation. Still, it’s been about a 70/30 split on good-to-bad with the bad often consuming half a day of my time going down a rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hats off for trying to avoid leaking tokens, as a security engineer I don't know if we should be happy for the job security or start drinking given all the new dumb issues generated fast than ever xD&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it's definitely a habit to have to identify when it's lost in its own hallucinations. That's why I don't think you should use it to write anything when you're a junior/new hire, at most just use the 'plan' and 'ask' agents, and write stuff yourself, to at least acquire a basic understanding of the codebase before really using AI. Basically if you're a .5x dev (which honestly, most of us are on a new environment), it'll make you a .25x, and make you stay there longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience AI and Rust is a mixed bag. The strong compile-time checks mean an agent can verify its work to a much larger extent than many other languages, but the understanding of lifetimes is somewhat weak (although better in Opus 4.5 than earlier models!), and the ecosystem moves fast and fairly often makes breaking changes, meaning that a lot of the training data is obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The weakness goes beyond lifetimes. In Rust programs with non-trivial type schemas, it can really struggle to get the types right. You see something similar with Haskell. Basically, proving non-trivial correctness properties globally is more difficult than just making a program work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;True. I do however like the process of working with an AI more in a language like Rust. It's a lot less prone to use ugly hacks to make something that compiles but fail spectacularly at runtime - usually because it can't get the ugly hacks to compile :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Makes it easier to intercede to steer the AI in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that "write a C program that [problem description]" is an extremely under-constrained task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People are highly aware that C++ programmers are always using some particular subset of C++; but it's not as obvious that any actual C programmer is actually going to use a particular dialect on top of C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the C standard library is so anemic for algorithms and data structures, any given "C programmer" is going to have a hash map of choice, a b-tree of choice, a streams abstraction of choice, an async abstraction of choice, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, in any project they create, they're going to depend on (or vendor in) those low-level libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, any big framework-ish library (GTK, OpenMP, OpenSSL) is also going to have its own set of built-in data structures that you have to use to interact with it (because it needs to take and return such data-structures in its API, and it has to define them in order to do that.) Which often makes it feel more correct, in such C projects, to use that framework's abstractions throughout your own code, rather than also bringing your own favorite ones and constantly hitting the impedance wall of FFI-ing between them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's actually shocking that, in both FOSS and hiring, we expect "experienced C programmers" who've worked for 99% of their careers with a dialect of C consisting of abstractions from libraries E+F+G, to also be able to jump onto C codebases that instead use abstractions from libraries W+X+Y+Z (that may depend on entirely different usage patterns for their safety guarantees!), look around a bit, and immediately be productively contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's no wonder an AI can't do that. Humans can barely do it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My guess is that the performance of an AI coding agent on a C coding problem would massively improve if you initially prompt it (or instruct it in an AGENTS.md file) in a way that entirely constrain its choices of abstractions. Either by explicitly listing them; or by just saying "write this code using the same C 'stdlib supplemental' abstractions used in [existing codebase]", where the existing codebase is either loaded into the workspace, or has a very detailed CONTRIBUTING .md you can point the agent at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't comment on Zig and Rust, but C is one of the languages in which LLMs are best, in my opinion. This seems natural to me, given the amount of C code that has been written over the decades and is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definitely disagree. It can regurgitate solved problems from open source codebases, sure. Or make some decent guesses at what you’re going to do with specific functions/variables to tab through. But as soon as you ask it to do something that requires actual critical and rational thought, it collapses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wrong data types, unfamiliarity with standards vs compiler extensions, a mish-mash of idioms, leaked pointers, bad logic, unsafe code (like potential overflows), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can get it to do what you like, but it takes a lot of hand-holding, guidance, and corrections. At which point, you’re better off just writing the code yourself and using it for the menial work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an example, I had it generate some test cases for me and 2/3 of the test cases would not work due to simple bitwise arithmetic (it expected a specific pattern in a bitstream that couldn’t exist given the shifts). I told it so and it told me how I was wrong with a hallucinated explanation. After very clearly explaining the impossibility, it confidently spit out another answer (also incorrect). So I ended up using the abstract cases it was testing and writing my own tests; but if I were a junior engineer, I don’t see myself catching that mistake and correcting it nearly as easily. Instead wasting time wondering what is wrong with my code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've had pretty good experience using Claude to "modernize" some old C code I wrote 30+ years ago. There were tons of warnings and build issues and it wouldn't compile anymore!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds like regular C programming, lol. On a serious note, give Opus 4.5 a try, maybe it would feel better. I’ve experimented with C the other week and it was quite fun. Also, check out Redis author’s post here from today or yesterday, he is also quite satisfied with the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI is pretty good at following existing patterns in a codebase. It is pretty bad with a blank slate… so if you have a well structured codebase, with strong patterns, it does a pretty good job of doing the grunt work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's such a huge and old talk about the death of COBOL coding/coders that I find it very surprising that nobody trained a model to help with exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working as a Software engineer in a European bank. There is a huge multi year program to remove COBOL as much as possible with cloud based Java Spring application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main reason is maintainability. There is no more cobol developers coming. Existing ones close to retirement or already retired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not in the COBOL world at all, but when I saw IBM putting out models for a while, I had to wonder if it was a byproduct of internal efforts to see if LLMs could help with the supposedly dwindling number of legacy mainframe developers. I don't know COBOL enough to be able to see if their Granite models are particularly strong in this area, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not COBOL but I sometimes have to maintain a large ColdFusion app. The early LLMs were pretty bad at it but these days, I can let AI write code and I "just" review it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also used AI to convert a really old legacy app to something more modern. It works surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like people who can't get AI to write production ready code are really bad at describing what they want done. The problem is that people want an LLM to one shot GTA6. When the average software developer prompts an LLM they expect 1) absolutely safe code 2) optimized/performant code 3) production ready code without even putting the requirements on credential/session handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to prompt it like it's an idiot, you need to be the architect and the person to lead the LLM into writing performant and safe code. You can't expect it to turn key one shot everything. LLMs are not at the point yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's just the thing though - it seems like, to get really good code out of an LLM, a lot of the time, you have to describe everything you want done and the full context in such excruciating detail and go through so many rounds of review and correction that it would be faster and easier to just write the code yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, but please remember you specify the common parts only once for the agent. From there, it’ll base its actions on all the instructions you kept on their configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve found LLMs to be severely underwhelming. A week or two ago I tried having both Gemini3 and GPT Codex refactor a simple Ruby class hierarchy and neither could even identify the classes that inherited from the class I wanted removed. Severely underwhelming. Describing what was wanted here boils down to minima language and they both failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sounds like my first job with a big consulting firm many years ago (COBOL as it happens) where programming tasks that were close to pseudocode were handed to the programmers by the analysts. The programmer (in theory) would have very few questions about what he was supposed to write, and was essentially just translating from the firm's internal spec language into COBOL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly this. Not sure what code other people who post here are writing but it cannot always and only be bleeding edge, fringe and incredible code. They don't seem to be able to get modern LLMs to produce decent/good code in Go or Rust, while I can prototype a new ESP32 which I've never seen fully in Rust and it can manage to solve even some edge cases which I can't find answers on dedicated forums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a sneaking suspicion that AI use isn't as easy as it's made out to be. There certainly seem to be a lot of people who fail to use it effectively, while others have great success. That indicates either a luck or a skill factor. The latter seems more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find that at the granularity you need to work with current LLMs to get a good enough output, while verifying its correctness is more effort than writing code directly. The usefulness of LLMs to me is to point me in a direction that I can then manually verify and implement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heard an excellent COBOL talk this summer that really helped me to understand it. The speaker was fairly confident that COBOL wasn't going away anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, that conference is right down the road from me, and I never knew about it. So, thanks for sharing!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first job was working at a credit union software company. I designed and built the front-end (windows applications, a telephone banking system, and a home-banking web thing) and middle-tier systems (VB.NET-based services). The real back-end, though, was an old COBOL system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember helping the COBOL programmers debug some stuff, and it was just so wildly foreign. My degree is in theoretical comp sci, and I'd seen a lot of different languages, including Prolog, various lisps and schemes, SQL, ADA, C++, C, Pascal, various assembly variants, but COBOL was simply unique. I've often wondered what ideas COBOL got right that we could learn from and leverage today in a new language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do remember our COBOL mainframes were really fast compared to the SQL Server layers my middle-tier services used, but I also remember looking at it and thinking it would be a giant pain to write (the numbers at the front of every line seemed like tedium that I would probably often get wrong).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Fortran and COBOL will be here long after many of the current languages have disappeared. They are unique to their domains viz. Fortran for Scientific Computing and COBOL for Business Data Processing with a huge amount of installed code-base much of it for critical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key to understanding their longevity lies in the fact that they were the earliest high-level languages invented at a time when all software was built for serious long-lived stuff viz. Banking, Insurance, Finance, Simulations, Numerical Analysis, Embedded etc. Computing was strictly Science/Mathematics/Business and so a lot of very smart domain experts and programmers built systems to last from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience working with large financial institutions and banks, there is plenty of running COBOL code that is around the average age of HN posters. Where as a lot of different languages code is replaced over time with something better/faster COBOL seems to have a staying power in financial that will ensure it's around a very very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whilst I agree with your point, I think what sometimes gets lost in these conversations is that reviewing code thoroughly is harder than writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, and I’m not trying to speak for everyone here, I found it took me just as long to review AI output as it would have taken to write that code myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been some exceptions to that rule. But those exceptions have generally been in domains I’m unfamiliar with. So we are back to trusting AI as a research assistant, if not a “vibe coding” assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; as long to review AI output as it would have taken to write that code myself&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is often the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What immensely helps though is that AI gets me past writer's block. Then I have to rewrite all the slop, but hey, it's rewrite and that's much easier to get in that zone and streamline the work. Sometimes I produce more code per day rewriting AI slop than writing it from scratch myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news here is that their code is of such a poor quality it doesn't properly work anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have recently tried to blindly create a small .dylib consolidation tool in JS using Claude Code, Opus 4.5 and AskUserTool to create a detailed spec. My god how awful and broken the code was. Unusable. But it faked* working just good enough to pass someone who's got no clue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The good news here is that their code is of such a poor quality it doesn't properly work anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just wishful thinking. In reality it works just well enough to be dangerous. Just look at the latest RCE in OpenCode. The AI it was vibe-coded with allowed any website with origin * to execute code, and the Prompt Engineer™ didn't understand the implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm watching the voters around the world electing charismatic leaders and then cheering the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus companies electing to replace software developers with AI slop are not of a much surprise to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter whether people will die because of AI slop. What matters is keeping Microsoft shareholders happy and they are only happy when there is a growing demand for slop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is my preferred way to use it also, though I see many folks seemingly pushing for pure vibe coding, apparently striving for maximum throughput as a high-priority goal. Which goal would be hindered by careful review of the output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's unclear to me why most software projects would need to grow by tens (or hundreds) of thousands of lines of code each day, but I guess that's a thing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This should be "especially in tests". It's more important that they work than the actual code, because their purpose is to catch when the rest of the code breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the question almost always comes with an undertone of “Can this replace me?”. If it’s just code search, debugging, the answer’s no because a non-developer won’t have the skills or experience to put it all together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That undertone is overt in the statements of CEOs and managers who salivate at “reducing headcount.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who should fear AI the most right now are the offshore shops. They’re the most replaceable because the only reason they exist is the desire to carve off low skill work and do it cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But all of this overblown anyway because I don’t see appetite for new software getting satiated anytime soon, even if we made everyone 2x productive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it doesn't. For example, you could use an AI agent just to aid you in code search and understanding or for filling out well specified functions which you then do QA on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do quality QA/code review, one of course needs to understand the design decisions/motivations/intentions (why those exact code lines were added, and why they are correct), meaning it is the same job as one would originally code those lines and building the understanding==quality on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the terminology, I consider "vibe-coding" as Claude etc. coding agents that sculpts entire blocks of code based on prompts. My use-tactic for LLM/AI-coding is to just get the signature/example of some functions that I need (because documents usually suck), and then coding it myself. That way the control/understanding is more (and very egoistically) in my hands/head, than in LLMs. I don't know what kind of projects you do, but many times the magic of LLMs ends, and the discussion just starts to go same incorrect circle when reflected on reality. At that point I need to return to use classic human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for COBOL + AI, in my experience mentioning "COBOL" means that there is usually DB + UI/APP/API/BATCHJOB for interacting with it. And the DB schema + semantics is propably the most critical to understand here, because it totally defines the operations/bizlogic/interpretations for it. So any "AI" would also need to understand your DB (semantically) fully to not make any mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in any case, someone needs to be responsible for the committed code, because only personified human blame and guilt can eventually avert/minimize sloppiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You 100% can use it this way. But it takes a lot of discipline to keep the slop out of the code base. The same way it took discipline to keep human slop out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has always been a class of devs who throw things at the wall and see what sticks. They copy paste from other parts of the application, or from stack overflow. They write half assed tests or no tests at all and they try their best to push it thought the review process with pleas about how urgent it is (there are developers on the opposite side of this spectrum who are also bad).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new problem is that this class of developer is the exact kind of developer who AI speeds up the most, and they are the most experienced at getting shit code through review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As others have said, US banks seem to run a lot of it, as in they have millions of lines of code of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not saying that banks don't also have a metric shitload of Java, they do. I think most people would be surprised how much code your average large bank manages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the US, there are several thousands of banks and credit unions, and the smaller ones use a patchwork of different vendor software. They likely don't have to write COBOL directly, but some of those components are still running it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the vendor's perspective, it doesn't make sense to do a complete rewrite and risk creating hairy financial issues for potentially hundreds of clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if the OP's question is motivated by there being less public examples of COBOL code to train LLM's on compared to newer languages (so a different experience is expected), or something else. If the prior, it'd be interesting to see if having a language spec and a few examples leads to even better results from an LLM, since less examples could also mean less bad examples that deviate from the spec :) if there are any dev's that use AI with COBOL and other more common languages, please share your comparative experience&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most COBOL I know of won't ever see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also COBOL seems to have a lot of flavors that are used by a few financial institutions. Since these are highly proprietary it seems very unlikely LLMs would be trained on them, and therefore the LLM would not be any use to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a COBOL dev, but I work on migrating projects from COBOL mainframes to Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally speaking any kind of AI is relatively hit or miss. We have a statically generated knowledge base of the migrated sourcecode that can be used as context for LLMs to work with, but even that is often not enough to do anything meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At times Opus 4.5 is able to debug small errors in COBOL modules given a stacktrace and enough hand-holding. Other models are decent at explaining semi-obscure COBOL patterns or at guessing what a module could be doing just given the name and location -- but more often than not they end up just being confidently wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the best use-case we have so far is business rule extraction - aka understanding what a module is trying to achieve without getting too much into details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TLDR, at least in our case, is that without any supporting RAGs/finetuning/etc all kind of AI works "just ok" and isn't such a big deal (yet)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I were using something like Claude Code to build a COBOL project, I'd structure the scaffolding to break problems into two phases: first, reason through the design from a purely theoretical perspective, weighing implementation tradeoffs; second, reference COBOL documentation and discuss how to make the solution as idiomatic as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I've never written a single line of COBOL. That said, I'm a programming language enthusiast who has shipped production code in FORTRAN, C, C++, Java, Scala, Clojure, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and probably others I'm forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may want to give free opensource GnuCOBOL a try. Works on Mac/Linux/Windows. As far as AI and Cobol, I do think Claude Opus 4.5 is getting pretty good. But like stated way above, verify and understand Every line it delivers to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am in banking and it's fine we have some finetuned models to work with our code base. I think COBOL is a good language for LLM use. It's verbose and English like syntax aligns naturally with the way language models process text. Can't complain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can you elaborate? See questions about what kind of use in sibling thread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in addition to the type of development you are doing in COBOL, I'm wondering if you also have used LLMs to port existing code to (say) Java, C# or whatever is current in (presumably) banking?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is implied but I guess needs to be made explicit: people are looking for answers from devs with direct knowledge of the question at hand, not what random devs suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the mass of code out there, it strikes me it's only a matter of time before someone fine tunes one of the larger more competent coding models on COBOL. If they haven't already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally I've had a lot of luck Opus etc with "odd" languages just making sure that the prompt is heavily tuned to describe best practices and reinforce descriptions of differences with "similar" languages. A few months ago with Sonnet 4, etc. this was dicey. Now I can run Opus 4.5 on my own rather bespoke language and get mostly excellent output. Especially when it has good tooling for verification, and reference documentation available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The downside is you use quite a bit of tokens doing this. Which is where I think fine tuning could help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bet one of the larger airlines or banks could dump some cash over to Anthropic etc to produce a custom trained model using a corpus of banking etc software, along with tools around the backend systems and so on. Worthwhile investment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case I can't see how this would be a threat to people who work in those domains. They'd be absolutely invaluable to understand and apply and review and improve the output. I can imagine it making their jobs 10x more pleasant though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which COBOL... This is a particular issue in COBOL is it's a much more fragmented language than most people outside the industry would expect. While a model would be useful for the company that supplied the data, the amount of transference may be more limited than one would expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've seen songs on spottily called "anything" and "Just play anything", so I guess it may be worthwhile if I change my name to "anyone" for when someone asks their LLM to "just hire anyone"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see it as a complete opposite for sure, I will tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it could have been a threat if it was something you cannot control, but you can control it, you can learn to control it, and controlling it in the right direction would enable anyone to actually secure your position or even advance it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, about the COBOL, well i dont know what the heck this is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is amazing! Thank you for confirming what I've been suspecting for a while now. People that actually know very little about software development now believe they don't need to know anything about it, and they are commenting very confidently here on hn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point about the mass of code running the economy being untouched by AI agents is so real. During my years as a developer, I've often faced the skepticism surrounding automation technologies, especially when it comes to legacy languages like COBOL. There’s a perception that as AI becomes more capable, it might threaten specialized roles. However, I believe that the intricacies and context of legacy systems often require human insight that AI has yet to master fully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compiling high level languages to assembly is a deterministic procedure. You write a program using a small well defined language (relative to natural language every programming language is tiny and extremely well defined). The same input to the same compiler will get you the same output every time. LLMs are nothing like a compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there any compiler that "rolls the dice" when it comes to optimizations? Like, if you compile the exact same code with the exact same compiler multiple times you'll get different assembly?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And th Alan Kay quote is great but does not apply here at all? I'm pointing out how silly it is to compare LLMs to compilers. That's all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rolling the dice is accomplished by mixing optimizations flags, PGO data and what parts of the CPU get used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or by using a managed language with dynamic compiler (aka JIT) and GC. They are also not deterministic when executed, and what outcome gets produced, it is all based on heuristics and measured probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, the quote does apply because many cannot grasp the idea of how technology looks beyond today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the compiler doesn't "roll the dice" when making those guesses! Compile the same code with the same compiler and you get the same result repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;CSS Web Components for marketing sites&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 4, 2024 – @hawkticehurst&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot take: I think “regular” web components (the ones with Shadow DOM and friends) are a terrible solution for marketing website design systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has always left a bad taste in my mouth when I run across a web component for a swimlane, banner, card, and so on. Why? Because these are components that (unless you’re doing something mighty fancy) should never require JavaScript as a dependency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, in the world of web components you are locked into JavaScript from the very start. To even register a web component with the browser you need JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if… we didn’t do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;HTML Web Components&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a good chunk of the last year focused on marketing site design systems at work. A regular topic of discussion is the need to build marketing sites that are accessible to folks with lower powered devices and poor internet connections. How do you achieve that? In short, use less JavaScript and ideally build UI with progressive enhancement in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to achieve these goals, but the method I’ve been focused on is how an HTML Web Component archictecture might be applied to implement a marketing site design system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a quick reminder/intro, HTML Web Components is a method of building web components where you write HTML as you would normally and then wrap the parts you want to be interactive using a custom element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you wanted to create a counter button it would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;counter-button&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;button&amp;gt;Count is &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/counter-button&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
  counter-button button {
    /* Counter button styles */
  }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
  class Counter extends HTMLElement {
    // Counter button behavior
  }
  customElements.define("counter-button", Counter);
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The markup in an HTML web component is parsed, rendered, and styled as normal HTML. That HTML will then be seamlessly hydrated once the JavaScript associated with the custom element tag is executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the markup of a "regular" web component (that uses Shadow DOM) is dynamically generated at runtime using JavaScript -- kind of like an SPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This component architecture is a really strong candidate for a marketing design system (and, as a bonus, avoids some of the big gotchas that come with regular web components).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;It is a perfect implementation of progressively enhanced UI&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It uses minimal and self-contained JavaScript — HTML Web Components can be thought of as islands&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You still get the power of custom element APIs to implement stuff like design system component variants&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The component markup is fully SSR-able&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The component markup can be styled like regular HTML&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Common accessibility practices can be applied without issue&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for all these benefits we’re still left with the original problem. HTML Web Components require JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CSS Web Components&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s the question: What would happen if we took the ideas of HTML Web Components and skipped all the JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get CSS Web Components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: I've never seen anyone talk about or name this concept before, so I'm using "CSS Web Components" to describe the idea. But please let me know if someone has already written about and named this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do they work? The exact same as HTML Web Components but you just take advantage of the powers of CSS to implement key functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example let’s implement that swimlane component:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;swim-lane&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Creativity unleashed&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;a href="/product"&amp;gt;Learn more&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;img src="product.jpg" alt="Product image" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/swim-lane&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
  swim-lane {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 2rem;
    color: white;
    background: black;
    padding: 1rem;
    border-radius: 16px;
  }
  swim-lane h2 {
    /* Swimlane title styles */
  }
  swim-lane p {
    /* Swimlane description styles */
  }
  swim-lane a {
    /* Swimlane link styles */
  }
  @media (max-width: 650px) {
    /* Mobile responsive styles */
  }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Creativity unleashed&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brand new way of illustrating for the web.&lt;/p&gt;Learn more&lt;p&gt;Okay great, we styled some HTML nested inside a custom element. There’s nothing too novel about that. But what about adding some functionality? Say, a component variant that lets you reverse the layout of the swimlane?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible using only CSS! Specifically, CSS attribute selectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;swim-lane layout="reverse"&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A brand new way of illustrating for the web.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a href="/product"&amp;gt;Learn more&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;img src="product.jpg" alt="Product image" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/swim-lane&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
  /* Other swimlane styles */
  swim-lane[layout="reverse"] {
    flex-direction: row-reverse;
  }
  @media (max-width: 650px) {
    swim-lane[layout="reverse"] {
      flex-direction: column-reverse;
    }
  }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Creativity unleashed&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brand new way of illustrating for the web.&lt;/p&gt;Learn more&lt;p&gt;Another really cool perk of this is that because you’re defining an attribute on a custom element you don’t have to worry about naming collisions with HTML attributes. No need to add &lt;code&gt;data-&lt;/code&gt; to the beginning of attributes like you would/should on normal HTML elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How far does this go?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, I believe this method of building design systems can go quite far. If you think about it, the vast majority of basic components you might need in a marketing design system are just vanilla HTML elements with specific style variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A marketing website button is just an anchor tag wrapped in a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link-button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; custom element and styled using custom attribute selectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link-button&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;a href=""&amp;gt;Learn more&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/link-button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;link-button variant="secondary"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;a href=""&amp;gt;Learn more&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/link-button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;link-button pill&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;a href=""&amp;gt;Learn more&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/link-button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;link-button size="large"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;a href=""&amp;gt;Learn more&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/link-button&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
  link-button a {
    /* Default link button styles */
  }
  link-button[variant="secondary"] a {
    background: transparent;
    color: white;
  }
  link-button[pill] a {
    border-radius: 50px;
  }
  link-button[size="large"] a {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    font-size: 1.25rem;
  }
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, imagine incorporating all the other powers that CSS (and HTML) bring to the table:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cascade layers for better control of how styles get applied&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Container queries for conditional style variants based on a parent container&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;:has(), :is(), and :where() to simplify complex selectors&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CSS variables for theming&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;@property rule for even more powerful CSS variables&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;light-dark() for system aware theming&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Popover API for menus, toggletips, and dialogs without JS&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Exclusive accordions for FAQ sections&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are quite large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Microstructure of Wealth Transfer in Prediction Markets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slot machines on the Las Vegas Strip return about 93 cents on the dollar. This is widely considered some of the worst odds in gambling. Yet on Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, traders have wagered vast sums on longshot contracts with historical returns as low as 43 cents on the dollar. Thousands of participants are voluntarily accepting expected values far lower than a casino slot machine to bet on their convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The efficient market hypothesis suggests that asset prices should perfectly aggregate all available information. Prediction markets theoretically provide the purest test of this theory. Unlike equities, there is no ambiguity about intrinsic value. A contract either pays $1 or it does not. A price of 5 cents should imply exactly a 5% probability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We analyzed 72.1 million trades covering $18.26 billion in volume to test this efficiency. Our findings suggest that collective accuracy relies less on rational actors than on a mechanism for harvesting error. We document a systematic wealth transfer where impulsive Takers pay a structural premium for affirmative "YES" outcomes while Makers capture an "Optimism Tax" simply by selling into this biased flow. The effect is strongest in high-engagement categories like Sports and Entertainment, while low-engagement categories like Finance approach perfect efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paper makes three contributions. First, it confirms the presence of the longshot bias on Kalshi and quantifies its magnitude across price levels. Second, it decomposes returns by market role, revealing a persistent wealth transfer from takers to makers driven by asymmetric order flow. Third, it identifies a YES/NO asymmetry where takers disproportionately favor affirmative bets at longshot prices, exacerbating their losses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prediction Markets and Kalshi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prediction markets are exchanges where participants trade binary contracts on real-world outcomes. These contracts settle at either $1 or $0, with prices ranging from 1 to 99 cents serving as probability proxies. Unlike equity markets, prediction markets are strictly zero-sum: every dollar of profit corresponds exactly to a dollar of loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kalshi launched in 2021 as the first U.S. prediction market regulated by the CFTC. Initially focused on economic and weather data, the platform stayed niche until 2024. A legal victory over the CFTC secured the right to list political contracts, and the 2024 election cycle triggered explosive growth. Sports markets, introduced in 2025, now dominate trading activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Volume distribution across categories is highly uneven. Sports accounts for 72% of notional volume, followed by politics at 13% and crypto at 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: Data collection concluded on 2025-11-25 at 17:00 ET; Q4 2025 figures are incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Data and Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dataset, available on GitHub, contains 7.68 million markets and 72.1 million trades. Each trade records the execution price (1-99 cents), taker side (yes/no), contract count, and timestamp. Markets include resolution outcome and category classification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Role assignment: Each trade identifies the liquidity taker. The maker took the opposite position. If&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;taker_side = yes&lt;/code&gt;at 10 cents, the taker bought YES at 10¢; the maker bought NO at 90¢.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cost Basis (): To compare asymmetries between YES and NO contracts, we normalize all trades by capital risked. For a standard YES trade at 5 cents, . For a NO trade at 5 cents, . All references to "Price" in this paper refer to this Cost Basis unless otherwise noted.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mispricing () measures the divergence between actual win rate and implied probability for a subset of trades :&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gross Excess return () is the return relative to cost, gross of platform fees, where is price in cents and is the outcome:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sample&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calculations derive from resolved markets only. Markets that were voided, delisted, or remain open are excluded. Additionally, trades from markets with less than $100 in notional volume were excluded. The dataset remains robust across all price levels; the sparsest bin (81-90¢) contains 5.8 million trades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Longshot Bias on Kalshi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First documented by Griffith (1949) in horse racing and later formalized by Thaler &amp;amp; Ziemba (1988) in their analysis of parimutuel betting markets, the longshot bias describes the tendency for bettors to overpay for low-probability outcomes. In efficient markets, a contract priced at cents should win approximately % of the time. In markets exhibiting longshot bias, low-priced contracts win less than their implied probability, while high-priced contracts win more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data confirms this pattern on Kalshi. Contracts trading at 5 cents win only 4.18% of the time, implying mispricing of -16.36%. Conversely, contracts at 95 cents win 95.83% of the time. This pattern is consistent; all contracts priced below 20 cents underperform their odds, while those above 80 cents outperform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The existence of the longshot bias raises a question unique to zero-sum markets: if some traders systematically overpay, who captures the surplus?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Maker-Taker Wealth Transfer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Decomposing Returns by Role&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Market microstructure defines two populations based on their interaction with the order book. A Maker provides liquidity by placing limit orders that rest on the book. A Taker consumes this liquidity by executing against resting orders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decomposing aggregate returns by role reveals a stark asymmetry:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Role&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Avg. Excess Return&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;95% CI&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Taker&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-1.12%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[-1.13%, -1.11%]&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Maker&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+1.12%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[+1.11%, +1.13%]&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The divergence is most pronounced at the tails. At 1-cent contracts, takers win only 0.43% of the time against an implied probability of 1%, corresponding to a mispricing of -57%. Makers on the same contracts win 1.57% of the time, resulting in a mispricing of +57%. At 50 cents, mispricing compresses; takers show -2.65%, and makers show +2.66%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Takers exhibit negative excess returns at 80 of 99 price levels. Makers exhibit positive excess returns at the same 80 levels. The market's aggregate miscalibration is concentrated in a specific population; takers bear the losses while makers capture the gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is This Just Spread Compensation?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An obvious objection arises; makers earn the bid-ask spread as compensation for providing liquidity. Their positive returns may simply reflect spread capture rather than the exploitation of biased flow. While plausible, two observations suggest otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first observation suggests the effect extends beyond pure spread capture; maker returns depend on which side they take. If profits were purely spread-based, it should not matter whether makers bought YES or NO. We test this by decomposing maker performance by position direction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Makers who buy NO outperform makers who buy YES 59% of the time. The volume-weighted excess return is +0.77 pp for makers buying YES versus +1.25 pp for makers buying NO, a gap of 0.47 percentage points. The effect is miniscule (Cohen's d = 0.02-0.03) but consistent. At minimum, this suggests spread capture is not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second observation strengthens the case further; the maker-taker gap varies substantially by market category.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Variation Across Categories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We examine whether the maker-taker gap varies by market category. If the bias reflects uninformed demand, categories attracting less sophisticated participants should show larger gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;0.2M&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The variation is striking. Finance shows a gap of merely 0.17 pp; the market is extremely efficient, with takers losing only 0.08% per trade. At the other extreme, World Events and Media show gaps exceeding 7 percentage points. Sports, the largest category by volume, exhibits a moderate gap of 2.23 pp. Given $6.1 billion in taker volume, even this modest gap generates substantial wealth transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is Finance efficient? The likely explanation is participant selection; financial questions attract traders who think in probabilities and expected values rather than fans betting on their favorite team or partisans betting on a preferred candidate. The questions themselves are dry ("Will the S&amp;amp;P close above 6000?"), which filters out emotional bettors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Evolution Over Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The maker-taker gap is not a fixed feature of the market; rather, it emerged as the platform grew. In Kalshi's early days, the pattern was reversed; takers earned positive excess returns while makers lost money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From launch through 2023, taker returns averaged +2.0% while maker returns averaged -2.0%. Without sophisticated counterparties, takers won; amateur makers defined the early period and were the losing population. This began to reverse in 2024 Q2, with the gap crossing zero and then widening sharply after the 2024 election.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inflection point coincides with two events; Kalshi's legal victory over the CFTC in October 2024, which permitted political contracts, and the subsequent 2024 election cycle. Volume exploded from $30 million in 2024 Q3 to $820 million in 2024 Q4. The new volume attracted sophisticated market makers, and with them, the extraction of value from taker flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-election, the average gap was -2.9 pp (takers winning); post-election, it flipped to +2.5 pp (makers winning), a swing of 5.3 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The composition of taker flow provides further evidence. If the wealth transfer arose because new participants arrived with stronger longshot preferences, we would expect the distribution to shift toward low-probability contracts. It did not:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The share of taker volume in longshot contracts (1-20¢) remained essentially flat; 4.8% pre-election versus 4.6% post-election. The distribution actually shifted toward the middle; the 91-99¢ bucket fell from 40-50% in 2021-2023 to under 20% in 2025, while mid-range prices (31-70¢) grew substantially. Taker behavior did not become more biased; if anything, it became less extreme. Yet taker losses increased; new market makers extract value more efficiently across all price levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This evolution reframes the aggregate results. The wealth transfer from takers to makers is not inherent to prediction market microstructure; it requires sophisticated market makers, and sophisticated market makers require sufficient volume to justify participation. In the low-volume early period, makers were likely unsophisticated individuals who lost to relatively informed takers. The volume surge attracted professional liquidity providers capable of extracting value from taker flow at all price points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The YES/NO Asymmetry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The maker-taker decomposition identifies who absorbs the losses, but leaves open the question of how their selection bias operates. Why is taker flow so consistently mispriced? The answer is not that makers possess superior foresight, but rather that takers exhibit a costly preference for affirmative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Asymmetry at Equivalent Prices&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard efficiency models imply that mispricing should be symmetric across contract types at equivalent prices; a 1-cent YES contract and a 1-cent NO contract should theoretically reflect similar expected values. The data contradicts this assumption. At a price of 1 cent, a YES contract carries a historical expected value of -41%; buyers lose nearly half their capital in expectation. Conversely, a NO contract at the same 1-cent price delivers a historical expected value of +23%. The divergence between these seemingly identical probability estimates is 64 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The advantage for NO contracts is persistent. NO outperforms YES at 69 of 99 price levels, with the advantage concentrating at the market extremes. NO contracts generate superior returns at every price increment from 1 to 10 cents and again from 91 to 99 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the market being zero-sum, dollar-weighted returns are -1.02% for YES buyers compared to +0.83% for NO buyers, a 1.85 percentage point gap driven by the overpricing of YES contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Takers Prefer Affirmative Bets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The underperformance of YES contracts may be linked to taker behavior. Breaking down the trading data reveals a structural imbalance in order flow composition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 1-10 cent range, where YES represents the longshot outcome, takers account for 41-47% of YES volume; makers account for only 20-24%. This imbalance inverts at the opposite end of the probability curve. When contracts trade at 99 cents, implying that NO is the 1-cent longshot, makers actively purchase NO contracts at 43% of volume. Takers participate at a rate of only 23%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One might hypothesize that makers exploit this asymmetry through superior directional forecasting—that they simply know when to buy NO. The evidence does not support this. When decomposing maker performance by position direction, returns are nearly identical. Statistically significant differences emerge only at the extreme tails (1–10¢ and 91–99¢), and even there, effect sizes are negligible (Cohen's d = 0.02–0.03). This symmetry is telling: makers do not profit by knowing which way to bet, but through some mechanism that applies equally to both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analysis of 72.1 million trades on Kalshi reveals a distinct market microstructure where wealth systematically transfers from liquidity takers to liquidity makers. This phenomenon is driven by specific behavioral biases, modulated by market maturity, and concentrated in categories that elicit high emotional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Mechanism of Extraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A central question in zero-sum market analysis is whether profitable participants win through superior information (forecasting) or superior structure (market making). Our data strongly supports the latter. When decomposing maker returns by position direction, the performance gap is negligible: makers buying "YES" earn an excess return of +0.77%, while those buying "NO" earn +1.25% (Cohen’s d ≈ 0.02). This statistical symmetry indicates that makers do not possess a significant ability to pick winners. Instead, they profit via a structural arbitrage: providing liquidity to a taker population that exhibits a costly preference for affirmative, longshot outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This extraction mechanism relies on the "Optimism Tax." Takers disproportionately purchase "YES" contracts at longshot prices, accounting for nearly half of all volume in that range, despite "YES" longshots underperforming "NO" longshots by up to 64 percentage points. Makers, therefore, do not need to predict the future; they simply need to act as the counterparty to optimism. This aligns with findings by Reichenbach and Walther (2025) on Polymarket and Whelan (2025) on Betfair, suggesting that in prediction markets, makers accommodate biased flow rather than out-forecast it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Professionalization of Liquidity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The temporal evolution of maker-taker returns challenges the assumption that longshot bias inevitably leads to wealth transfer. From 2021 through 2023, the bias existed, yet takers maintained positive excess returns. The reversal of this trend coincides precisely with the explosive volume growth following Kalshi’s October 2024 legal victory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wealth transfer observed in late 2024 is a function of market depth. In the platform's infancy, low liquidity likely deterred sophisticated algorithmic market makers, leaving the order book to be populated by amateurs who were statistically indistinguishable from takers. The massive volume surge following the 2024 election incentivized the entry of professional liquidity providers capable of systematically capturing the spread and exploiting the biased flow. The longshot bias itself may have persisted for years, but it was only once market depth grew sufficiently to attract these sophisticated makers that the bias became a reliable source of profit extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Category Differences and Participant Selection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The variation in maker-taker gaps across categories reveals how participant selection shapes market efficiency. At one extreme, Finance exhibits a gap of just 0.17 percentage points; nearly perfect efficiency. At the other, World Events and Media exceed 7 percentage points. This difference cannot be explained by the longshot bias alone; it reflects who chooses to trade in each category.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finance (0.17 pp) serves as a control group demonstrating that prediction markets can approach efficiency. Questions like "Will the S&amp;amp;P close above 6000?" attract participants who think in probabilities and expected values, likely the same population that trades options or follows macroeconomic data. The barrier to informed participation is high, and casual bettors have no edge and likely recognize this, filtering themselves out.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Politics (1.02 pp) shows moderate inefficiency despite high emotional stakes. Political bettors follow polling closely and have practiced calibrating beliefs through election cycles. The gap is larger than Finance but far smaller than entertainment categories, suggesting that political engagement, while emotional, does not entirely erode probabilistic reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sports (2.23 pp) represents the modal prediction market participant. The gap is moderate but consequential given the category's 72% volume share. Sports bettors exhibit well-documented biases, including home team loyalty, recency effects, and narrative attachment to star players. A fan betting on their team to win the championship is not calculating expected value; they are purchasing hope.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Crypto (2.69 pp) attracts participants conditioned by the "number go up" mentality of retail crypto markets, a population overlapping with meme stock traders and NFT speculators. Questions like "Will Bitcoin reach $100k?" invite narrative-driven betting rather than probability estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Entertainment, Media, and World Events (4.79–7.32 pp) exhibit the largest gaps and share a common feature: minimal barriers to perceived expertise. Anyone who follows celebrity gossip feels qualified to bet on award show outcomes; anyone who reads headlines feels informed about geopolitics. This creates a participant pool that conflates familiarity with calibration.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern suggests efficiency depends on two factors: the technical barrier to informed participation and the degree to which questions invite emotional reasoning. When barriers are high and framing is clinical, markets approach efficiency; when barriers are low and framing invites storytelling, the optimism tax reaches its maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the data is robust, several limitations persist. First, the absence of unique trader IDs forces us to rely on the "Maker/Taker" classification as a proxy for "Sophisticated/Unsophisticated." While standard in microstructure literature, this imperfectly captures instances where sophisticated traders cross the spread to act on time-sensitive information. Second, we cannot directly observe the bid-ask spread in historical trade data, making it difficult to strictly decouple spread capture from explotation of biased flow. Finally, these results are specific to a US-regulated environment; offshore venues with different leverage caps and fee structures may exhibit different dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The promise of prediction markets lies in their ability to aggregate diverse information into a single, accurate probability. However, our analysis of Kalshi demonstrates that this signal is often distorted by systematic wealth transfer driven by human psychology and market microstructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The market is split into two distinct populations: a taker class that systematically overpays for low-probability, affirmative outcomes, and a maker class that extracts this premium through passive liquidity provision. This dynamic is not an inherent flaw of the "wisdom of the crowd," but rather a feature of how human psychology interacts with market microstructure. When the topic is dry and quantitative (Finance), the market is efficient. When the topic allows for tribalism and hope (Sports, Entertainment), the market transforms into a mechanism for transferring wealth from the optimistic to the calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple is testing a new design for App Store search ads on iPhone. Some users on iOS 26.3 are noticing that the blue background around sponsored results is no longer shown, blurring the line between what paid ad results look like and the real search results that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means the only differentiator between organic results and the promoted ad is the presence of the small ‘Ad’ banner next to the app icon. Right now, it appears to be in some kind of A/B test phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have asked Apple for clarity on the change, and whether this will roll out more widely in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It may be related to the company’s announcement from December that App Store search results will soon start including more than one sponsored result for a given search query. The removal of the blue background will mean all of the ads will appear in the list in a more integrated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, this also has the effect of making it harder for users to quickly distinguish at a glance what is an ad and what isn’t, potentially misleading some users into not realising that the first result is a paid ad placement. While not great for user experience, it probably helps increase click-through rates which ultimately boosts Apple’s revenue in its ads business.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If cows could use tools, imagine the scenes that might unfold: cutting wires to escape from their pastures; extracting themselves from milking machines; or removing the twine on hay bales. Cows haven’t been seen doing any of these things, of course. But a study published today in Current Biology demonstrates a cow named Veronika effectively using a deck broom as a scratching tool, satisfying the scientific definition of tool use as “the manipulation of an external object to achieve a goal via a mechanical interface.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Veronika is a pet Brown Swiss cow (Bos taurus) kept as a companion by a farmer. In a series of 10 trials, researchers from the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna presented her with a deck broom tossed on the ground in a random orientation. Each trial, they recorded which end of the brush she selected and how she used it. Veronika manipulated the broom with her mouth, positioning it under her tongue, then wedging it into the gaps between her incisors and molars for a stable grip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Veronika adeptly used the deck brush to scratch her itches, manipulating it to target different areas. Across the randomized trials, she chose the bristled end to scratch her hindquarters but switched to the stick end for softer lower-body areas. Across repeat trials, she made consistent choices about how to wield the broom. “When I saw the footage, it was immediately clear that this was not accidental,” said study author and cognitive biologist Alice Auersperg in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read more: “Scratch My Back and I’ll Scratch Yours”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Veronika’s tool use is considered “egocentric” tooling because it’s directed at herself. Although it’s simpler than “allocentric” tool use, wherein the tool is directed at something outside of oneself, it’s nevertheless a cognitive feat. Other than in primates, such adaptive use of a tool by a mammal has never been reported before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that the abilities of cows have been underrated, since tool use offers a “stringent test of cognitive flexibility,” wrote the study authors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps that shouldn’t surprise us, since cows have been associated with humans for more than 10,000 years as domesticated animals. The researchers point out that Veronika may have had ample time to experiment and learn this behavior during prolonged contact with a human-built environment. Her status as a companion animal to the farmer might also have provided more opportunities to observe a cow’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The findings highlight how assumptions about livestock intelligence may reflect gaps in observation rather than genuine cognitive limits,” said Auersperg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What will cows, sheep, or goats be doing next?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article describes my journey building the Bun JavaScript toolkit without relying on any of its usual binary dependenciesâ namely itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It all started when I wanted to try OpenCode for LLM-assisted coding. I found that it wasnât easy to installâmy distro packaged neither OpenCode itself, nor Bun, the JavaScript runtime used by OpenCode. The aur didnât come to the rescue either as the latest revision of the Bun package failed to build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Bun was packaged for Arch Linux on 2025-12-30 ð! However Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu still do not package it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also uncovered an unfortunate dependency: there was no clearly documented process for bootstrapping Bun; its build process unabashedly invokes the Bun CLI, assuming it was previously built. The development Dockerfiles and CI scripts for the Bun repo simply download the binary from a prior revision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâll admit that I 99% trust binaries built by open source GitHub actions. However I completely trust packages built by myself or signed by my distroâs maintainers. I decided to pursue that incremental 1% (since maybe others could find it useful too).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Exploratory work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I didnât have Bun on my system, but I did have Node. My first thought was to create some &lt;code&gt;bun-wrapper&lt;/code&gt; script that
            would snitch on how and from where it was invoked. The script would
            also evolve to try to fulfill the calls it was receiving
            using alternative tools. I reasoned that this way of logging the
            dependencies that the build scripts have on Bun
            in practice would be faster than reading through lots of
            code.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end a mixture of techniques was needed. The wrapper script was useful for getting the big picture of what subcommands were needed, but it was hard to produce the output expected by the scriptâs callers without reading the callsites. Becoming more familiar with the build scripts also gave me some idea of the scale of the task that I was previously only guessing at (it seemed manageable).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bunâs filling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What follows is an edited version of an RFC that I sent to the Bun maintainers detailing my end approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I concluded that Bunâs build scripts depend on Bun to fill three key roles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a package manager.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a TypeScript runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a bundler.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In each case I found the most suitable replacement tools for the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(At some point I also ditched the wrapper script in favor of invoking replacement tools directly, modifying build scripts to invoke them directly or in place of Bun via CMake defines.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Build-time package installation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First I tackled any use cases the build scripts had for installing npm dependencies. This was the simplest change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; It turns out that Bunâs &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; has not diverged
            much from what Node and npm support. The only modification I needed
            was to replace the &lt;code&gt;workspace:&amp;lt;ver&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; version
            specifier for workspace-local dependencies with simply
            &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ver&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The behavior for both patterns seems to be
            the same and to match maintainer intent in both Bun and npm.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; After that came the simple matter of introducing a new CMake option to allow defining &lt;code&gt;-DNPM_EXECUTABLE&lt;/code&gt;, which defaults to
            &lt;code&gt;${BUN_EXECUTABLE}&lt;/code&gt; but can be set to
            &lt;code&gt;/path/to/npm&lt;/code&gt; for bootstrapping.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; One here-there-be-dragons encounter was in &lt;code&gt;cppbind.ts&lt;/code&gt;.
            The script was helpfully(?) written to
            shell out to &lt;code&gt;bun install&lt;/code&gt;
            in its own directory if it detected that package dependencies were
            not yet installed. I replaced this with CMake orchestration to
            declare package installation as a dependency
            of this script in the build DAG.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interpreter / type stripping&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next task was to figure out how to interpret the TypeScript source files which comprise Bunâs build scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I observed that Bunâs runtime exposes several methods and classes in the &lt;code&gt;Bun&lt;/code&gt; namespace that the JS ecosystem, including the
            Bun build scripts, have started to rely on.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; For the most part, it was easy to shift from APIs like &lt;code&gt;Bun.file&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;node:fs&lt;/code&gt; module. An
            exception was some complex classes like
            &lt;code&gt;Bun.Transpiler&lt;/code&gt; for which my current best solution is to
            depend on a third-party package. It might be possible to package the
            underlying transpiler utility as a leaf that can be depended on by
            both codegen and the Bun runtime though.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Another handy feature of the Bun interpreter is that it can interpret TypeScript files without a prior explicit transpile step. I thought this might be tricky to replicate, but I was excited to learn that Node since v22.18 has supported type stripping to similarly interpret TS. After a few minor syntax changes (primarily to replace declarations that were actually used at runtime with real values, e.g. &lt;code&gt;declare unique symbol&lt;/code&gt; â
            &lt;code&gt;Symbol&lt;/code&gt;), this feature worked great.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Build-time bundling / transpiling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally I tackled Bunâs bundling use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several of the code generation scripts are responsible for taking code written in TypeScript and transpiling it to JavaScript. For example, the builtin modules provided by Bun for scripts to use are developed in TypeScript and may depend on other files, but when the builtins are provided to JavaScriptCore (the underlying runtime which powers Bun), these abstractions must have been previously bundled / transpiled away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bunâs implementation seems to descend in part from esbuild, a pioneer in making tools for JavaScript run in a reasonable amount of time. I figured employing esbuild for build-time bundling would thus be both easier to plug in to the Bun repository and also less objectionable than alternatives to the Bun maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Drafting the initial set of code changes was not a complex task. Most bundler options in use were easy to map. Shelling out to &lt;code&gt;bun build&lt;/code&gt; or invoking &lt;code&gt;Bun.build&lt;/code&gt; in code
            could both be substituted with &lt;code&gt;esbuild.build&lt;/code&gt;. Where the
            task became more tricky was in actually assembling the binary and
            subsequently to load the bundled code at runtime.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;zig panic&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first post-codegen issue I encountered was a panic in the Zig compiler. One with no stack trace to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My debugging strategy was to eliminate many variables at the same time. I knew that Bun uses a fork of the Zig compiler, and I also knew that prebuilt binaries might lack debug info and may even fail subtly on a new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To move forward, I created a side patch series (not part of my RFC submission) to enable defining a local Zig compiler to use for the build in a similar way to how local WebKit/JavaScriptCore is configured. This required CMake changes, but also some more interesting hacks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; With upstream Zig in place of the fork, I had to patch out any features that Bunâs Zig code had on private patches. In practice, there was only one such feature, but a big one. Thereâs a long-running feature request in the Zig issue tracker to add support for private struct fields. Iâm not qualified to opine on that debate, but I can observe that the Bun team leans strongly in favor of the proposal given that they forked Zig, added this feature, and rely on it extensively in the Bun codebase. Reverting to upstream Zig required undoing this dependency, which was luckily possible with string substitution: I simply prefixed &lt;code&gt;#private&lt;/code&gt; members as public
            &lt;code&gt;_members&lt;/code&gt;.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; One last puzzling change was a linker error. When assembling the final binary consisting of Zig and C++ object files, symbols couldnât be found. &lt;code&gt;nm&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;bun-zig.o&lt;/code&gt; showed
            that no symbols were exported, and furthermore the binary file was
            simply empty. I flailed here for a long time but what ultimately
            fixed the issue was building &lt;code&gt;bun-zig.o&lt;/code&gt; as a static
            archive instead of an object file ð¤·.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I opted to eliminate many variables at the same time, Iâm unfortunately not sure what the problem was with the original binary (whether in the oven-sh patches or a binary incompatibility or something else). But I was unblocked; the build succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;âUnexpected end of scriptâ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I had a freshly baked &lt;code&gt;bun-debug&lt;/code&gt; binary, but it couldnât
            &lt;code&gt;assert.strictEqual(2 + 2, 4)&lt;/code&gt;. Importing and using the
            &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; builtin produced the following quite opaque
            error.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Error parsing builtin: Unexpected end of script [followed by SIGABRT and core dump]&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spun my wheels a little by reading through assert.js and by using the creduce tool to produce a minimal reproduction of assert.js in the hopes that a problem in ~400 bytes would be more easy to eyeball than one in ~22,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In the end though, the winning debugging strategy was compiling WebKitâs JavaScriptCore from source and swapping it in place of the vendored binary (similarly to how I swapped in my own Zig above). Added debug logging revealed that the builtin in question was actually &lt;code&gt;internal/util/inspect.js&lt;/code&gt; (which was prepended
            to, or perhaps a dependency of, assert.js).
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The case was blown wide open when the logs showed that the postprocessing phase of builtin bundling erroneously appended &lt;code&gt;})&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the file with no
            preceding newline. For any bundled file which ended with a comment,
            this left the closing brackets commented out, hence the unexpected
            end of script.
          &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Success&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After solving the problems above I had a working build system, and better yet a working binary!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I packaged the bootstrapped build commands as a quick and dirty PKGBUILD and successfully used the resulting build to run OpenCode. Without further ado, hereâs the bootstrapped Bun build command for use with my fork:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;node ./scripts/build.mjs \ -GNinja \ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \ -B build/release \ --log-level=NOTICE \ -DBUN_EXECUTABLE="$(which node)" \ -DNPM_EXECUTABLE="$(which npm)" \ -DZIG_EXECUTABLE="$(which zig)" \ -DENABLE_ASAN=OFF \ -DCACHE_STRATEGY=none&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, the only regret I have from time spent on this project is some poor decisionmaking when using LLMs to assist me on the work. Overall, Iâm happy to have achieved my goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lesson to take away is that when you have the gift of an open source dependency, jump first to building it from source and using either a debugger or logs rather than treating it as a black box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Upstreaming patches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As alluded to earlier, I sent an RFC to the Bun team to test the waters on whether these patches might be upstreamable. I tried to always choose the more maintainable option when faced with implementation decisions, so there is a chance. However I recognize that this is a big change to the build system and I wonât be disappointed if the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the mean time, feel free to check out my fork at bmwalters/bun and to try it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your site will be removed from Google search results if you don't have a robots.txt file or the Googlebot site crawler can't access it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the video from Google Support that covers it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adam Coster ran into a weird issue with site traffic and posted about it in the Shop Talk Show discord. Traffic incoming from Google looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issues seemed to be that Google wouldn't index the site without a robots.txt file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first reaction: No fucking way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't imagine Google voluntarily slurping up less content. I went to see what I could find. Sure enough, I found this page from Google Support from July 23, 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix 'robots.txt unreachable' Error ~ Website Not Indexing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pull quote from the video on the page:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Your robots.txt file is the very first thing Googlebot looks for. If it can not reach this file, it will stop and won't crawl the rest of your site. Meaning your pages will remain invisible (on Google).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holy shit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't looked to see if this was a recent change, but it has to be. There's no way something so fundamental has just slipped by without becoming common knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, the timeline doesn't matter. It's how things are now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This absolutely blows my mind. I don't have tracking on my site. I never would have noticed this if someone hadn't pointed it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just wild,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Adam for letting me share the traffic graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need a quick fix, create a text file at the root of your website called "robots.txt" (e.g. https://www.example.com/robots.txt). Put the following contents in it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;User-agent: *
Allow: /&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the code from Google's How to write and submit a robots.txt file page. It provides explicit permission for the Googlebot (and other bots/crawlers/scrapers that use the file) to access anything they can find on your site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can read more about the file on the robots.txt wikipedia page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top Stack Overflow answer on robots.txt has a discussion about &lt;code&gt;Allow: /&lt;/code&gt; not being valid according to the spec. The only date for the comments is "Over a year ago" but given that the question is from 2010 the comments are probably from around that time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of at least the Sept. 2022 spec from the Internet Engineering Task Force, the &lt;code&gt;Allow: /&lt;/code&gt; syntax is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't have a robots.txt right now. It hasn't been there in a long time. Google still shows two results when I search for files on my site though:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No idea if that's because of external links or the fact that they are in the index from a long time ago. But,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I've got north of 3K posts on the site. I know a ton of them showed up in the past, if not all of them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I made a bunch of posts between the first Dec. 27, 2025 result and the second one from "one day ago" which was Jan. 6, 2026. No idea why just those two are showing up.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I used to have the first search result for "bama braves logo" in general google search, but that page is no longer in the index.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The video says Googlebot stops it if can't access the robots.txt file. I'm taking that to mean that the file must exist. It's possible that Googlebot will continue if the file doesn't exist and returns a 404.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The video doesn't address that specifically, but I interpret the content to mean that a missing file stops the bot. Especially because Adam's site didn't have one which started this whole post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe Google is trying to play nice with the way it ingests data given all the AI crawlers that are slamming sites these days?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm super curious what discussions led to the requirement for the file.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a curious raccoon broke into an Ashland, Virginia, liquor store in December 2025, sampled the stock and passed out on the bathroom floor, the story went viral within minutes. The local animal shelter’s Facebook post was picked up by national and international outlets and quickly inspired raccoon-themed cocktails, “trashed panda” merchandise and even a cameo on “Saturday Night Live.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, the story hit close to home. The store that hosted this inebriated bandit sits just blocks from the small behavioral neuroscience laboratory where I began investigating raccoon brains about 15 years ago. Although the so-called drunken raccoon made questionable decisions after breaking into the liquor store, the species – Procyon lotor – is known for its impressive intelligence, curiosity and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite being one of the most intriguing mammals living alongside humans, raccoons have avoided the scientific spotlight. Why aren’t more neuroscientists and psychologists studying raccoons? What have researchers missed about the mammalian brain by focusing on rodents instead?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why raccoons aren’t lab staples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., it is estimated that laboratories use more than 100 million rodents, including mice and rats, each year. Rodents are ideal for research because they reproduce easily and adapt well to confinement. Scientists have tailored extensive research tools to study them. Long before rats dominated psychology labs, raccoons were actually a leading candidate for animal models of problem-solving and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That ended when scientists realized they’d met their cognitive match. In one study, researchers reported that all raccoon participants escaped through the laboratory ventilation system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, scientists promptly shifted to rodents. Practicality – not scientific suitability – ultimately crowned the rat as king of the laboratory. I have studied rats for decades, and I can confirm that none have ever disappeared into the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Neither pet nor pest&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans have an ambivalent relationship with raccoons. They appear too wild to be domesticated, too endearing to be treated purely as pests and too ubiquitous to be considered exotic wildlife. Even President Calvin Coolidge, who famously received a raccoon intended for the dinner table from a supporter in Mississippi, ended up keeping it as a beloved White House pet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the role confusion continues today with glimpses of humanlike behaviors in raccoons as they enter our living spaces. One report described raccoons interacting with playground equipment at a child care center on Canada’s west coast in ways similar to human children, and even breaking into classrooms as if they were auditing the morning lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by Montessori education principles, I visited a raccoon rehabilitation center in Saskatoon, Canada, called Bandit Ranch Rehab a few years ago. After introducing young raccoons to slinkies, puzzles and blocks, I sat in awe as they interacted with these objects with the focused enthusiasm of preschoolers on a mission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This interspecies confusion seems to be mutual. Recent evidence suggests that urban raccoons are becoming increasingly tolerant of humans, especially when it suits them. But they are quick to leave when curiosity or opportunity calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Raccoon imagination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drunken Ashland raccoon captured global attention because it fit the narrative people have projected onto the species: mischievous, opportunistic, clever and more than a little humanlike. But their sophisticated brains and mental capacities, aligning more with primates than other mammals, are even more intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early behavioral research suggested that raccoons can learn a task, walk away and later return to solve it accurately – as if having mentally rehearsed the solution. In contrast, other species, including dogs and rats, needed to maintain continuous focus. Scientists have speculated that raccoons have mental imagery capabilities similar to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a rogue raccoon scaled a 25-story skyscraper in Minneapolis several years ago, I couldn’t help but wonder what that animal was anticipating at the top. Do raccoons form internal representations of future outcomes? And if so, how much agency and foresight do they bring to their decisions?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, I have collaborated with wildlife biologists, veterinarians and neuroscientists around the country to study what may be one of the most underestimated and understudied brains in the animal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s going on inside the raccoon brain?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with neuroscientist Suzana Herculano-Houzel, my laboratory at the University of Richmond has found that raccoons pack an astonishing number of neurons – an amount comparable to primates – into their brains. Scaled up to size, a raccoon brain would contain roughly the same number of neurons as a human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also found that raccoons possess specialized fast-conducting brain cells known as von Economo neurons, which are also found in humans, other great apes and a few additional large-brained mammals. In apes, these neurons appear in both the insula – a part of the brain important for processing internal body states – and the anterior cingulate, which plays a key role in emotional regulation. In raccoons, these neurons are present only in the insula and not in the anterior cingulate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This neural arrangement may help explain the species’ striking combination of clever problem-solving and rapid decision-making during exploration – frequently leading to risky behaviors that can have unfortunate consequences. These findings raise the possibility that raccoon neuroscience could offer useful insights into the neural foundations of impulse control and distracted attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In collaboration with ecologist Sara Benson-Abram’s research team, we also found that raccoons with more sophisticated cognitive abilities had more neural cells in the hippocampus, reinforcing the idea that their learning and memory capacities map onto similar brain systems as those in people. Taxi drivers in London, who frequently use their knowledge of the 25,000 streets in London, also have a larger hippocampal area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to their impressive brains, raccoons’ dexterous hands play a key role in their cognitively creative escapades. Indeed, researchers have found that raccoon forepaws are mapped onto their cerebral cortex – the outer layer of the brain – in a similar manner as human hands. Both take up a lot of real estate in the brain. As journalist Carl Zimmer wrote, “The hand is where the mind meets the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What raccoons can teach us about the human brain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I argue in my upcoming book “Wild Brains,” understanding raccoon intelligence requires observing them in the environments they choose – not confining them to the small, simple spaces that suit rats and mice. So-called living laboratories that monitor wildlife without restricting their behavior may be scientists’ best chance at unlocking the secrets of this species’ remarkable mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my graduate training, I was taught to avoid anthropomorphizing animal research subjects – to resist the temptation to project human thoughts and emotions onto nonhuman minds, because human brains likely contribute to uniquely human cognitive and emotional experiences. But primatologist Frans de Waal later introduced the useful counterpoint of anthropodenial: the mistaken assumption that animals cannot share emotional or cognitive capacities with humans simply because they are not human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drunken Ashland raccoon captured global attention not just because the story was funny, but because it felt familiar. People recognized something of themselves in this curious, impulsive, problem-solving animal navigating a very human environment. A willingness to lean away from anthropodenial – while remaining grounded in rigorous science – may open new paths for understanding raccoon intelligence and, ultimately, the wonderfully complex human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On January 8, 2026, a routine update to 1.1.1.1 aimed at reducing memory usage accidentally triggered a wave of DNS resolution failures for users across the Internet. The root cause wasn't an attack or an outage, but a subtle shift in the order of records within our DNS responses. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While most modern software treats the order of records in DNS responses as irrelevant, we discovered that some implementations expect CNAME records to appear before everything else. When that order changed, resolution started failing. This post explores the code change that caused the shift, why it broke specific DNS clients, and the 40-year-old protocol ambiguity that makes the "correct" order of a DNS response difficult to define.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All timestamps referenced are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Revert is completed. Impact ends&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While making some improvements to lower the memory usage of our cache implementation, we introduced a subtle change to CNAME record ordering. The change was introduced on December 2, 2025, released to our testing environment on December 10, and began deployment on January 7, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How DNS CNAME chains work&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When you query for a domain like &lt;code&gt;www.example.com&lt;/code&gt;, you might get a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that indicates one name is an alias for another name. Itâs the job of public resolvers, such as 1.1.1.1, to follow this chain of aliases until it reaches a final response:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;www.example.com â cdn.example.com â server.cdn-provider.com â 198.51.100.1&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As 1.1.1.1 traverses this chain, it caches every intermediate record. Each record in the chain has its own TTL (Time-To-Live), indicating how long we can cache it. Not all the TTLs in a CNAME chain need to be the same:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;www.example.com â cdn.example.com (TTL: 3600 seconds) # Still cached
cdn.example.com â 198.51.100.1Â  Â  (TTL: 300 seconds)Â  # Expired&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When one or more records in a CNAME chain expire, itâs considered partially expired. Fortunately, since parts of the chain are still in our cache, we donât have to resolve the entire CNAME chain again â only the part that has expired. In our example above, we would take the still valid &lt;code&gt;www.example.com â cdn.example.com&lt;/code&gt; chain, and only resolve the expired &lt;code&gt;cdn.example.com&lt;/code&gt; A record. Once thatâs done, we combine the existing CNAME chain and the newly resolved records into a single response.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The code that merges these two chains is where the change occurred. Previously, the code would create a new list, insert the existing CNAME chain, and then append the new records:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;impl PartialChain {
    /// Merges records to the cache entry to make the cached records complete.
    pub fn fill_cache(&amp;amp;self, entry: &amp;amp;mut CacheEntry) {
        let mut answer_rrs = Vec::with_capacity(entry.answer.len() + self.records.len());
        answer_rrs.extend_from_slice(&amp;amp;self.records); // CNAMEs first
        answer_rrs.extend_from_slice(&amp;amp;entry.answer); // Then A/AAAA records
        entry.answer = answer_rrs;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, to save some memory allocations and copies, the code was changed to instead append the CNAMEs to the existing answer list:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;impl PartialChain {
    /// Merges records to the cache entry to make the cached records complete.
    pub fn fill_cache(&amp;amp;self, entry: &amp;amp;mut CacheEntry) {
        entry.answer.extend(self.records); // CNAMEs last
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As a result, the responses that 1.1.1.1 returned now sometimes had the CNAME records appearing at the bottom, after the final resolved answer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When DNS clients receive a response with a CNAME chain in the answer section, they also need to follow this chain to find out that &lt;code&gt;www.example.com&lt;/code&gt; points to &lt;code&gt;198.51.100.1&lt;/code&gt;. Some DNS client implementations handle this by keeping track of the expected name for the records as theyâre iterated sequentially. When a CNAME is encountered, the expected name is updated:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;When the CNAME suddenly appears at the bottom, this no longer works:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;No more records are present, so the response is considered empty&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One such implementation that broke is the &lt;code&gt;getaddrinfo&lt;/code&gt; function in glibc, which is commonly used on Linux for DNS resolution. When looking at its &lt;code&gt;getanswer_r&lt;/code&gt; implementation, we can indeed see it expects to find the CNAME records before any answers:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;for (; ancount &amp;gt; 0; --ancount)
  {

        int n = __ns_name_unpack (c.begin, c.end, rr.rdata,

        expected_name = name_buffer;  // Update what we're looking for
      }
    else if (rr.rtype == qtype
             &amp;amp;&amp;amp; __ns_samebinaryname (rr.rname, expected_name)  // Must match!
             &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rr.rdlength == rrtype_to_rdata_length (type:qtype))
      {
        /* Address record matches - store it */
        ptrlist_add (list:addresses, item:(char *) alloc_buffer_next (abuf, uint32_t));
        alloc_buffer_copy_bytes (buf:abuf, src:rr.rdata, size:rr.rdlength);
      }
  }
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another notable affected implementation was the DNSC process in three models of Cisco ethernet switches. In the case where switches had been configured to use 1.1.1.1 these switches experienced spontaneous reboot loops when they received a response containing the reordered CNAMEs. Cisco has published a service document describing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Not all implementations break&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most DNS clients donât have this issue. For example, systemd-resolved first parses the records into an ordered set:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;typedef struct DnsAnswerItem {
        DnsResourceRecord *rr; // The actual record
        DnsAnswerFlags flags;  // Which section it came from
        // ... other metadata
} DnsAnswerItem;


typedef struct DnsAnswer {
        unsigned n_ref;
        OrderedSet *items;
} DnsAnswer;
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When following a CNAME chain it can then search the entire answer set, even if the CNAME records donât appear at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;RFC 1034, published in 1987, defines much of the behavior of the DNS protocol, and should give us an answer on whether the order of CNAME records matters. Section 4.3.1 contains the following text:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If recursive service is requested and available, the recursive response to a query will be one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;- The answer to the query, possibly preface by one or more CNAME RRs that specify aliases encountered on the way to an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While "possibly preface" can be interpreted as a requirement for CNAME records to appear before everything else, it does not use normative key words, such as MUST and SHOULD that modern RFCs use to express requirements. This isnât a flaw in RFC 1034, but simply a result of its age. RFC 2119, which standardized these key words, was published in 1997, 10 years after RFC 1034.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In our case, we did originally implement the specification so that CNAMEs appear first. However, we did not have any tests asserting the behavior remains consistent due to the ambiguous language in the RFC.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The subtle distinction: RRsets vs RRs in message sections&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To understand why this ambiguity exists, we need to understand a subtle but important distinction in DNS terminology.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;RFC 1034 section 3.6 defines Resource Record Sets (RRsets) as collections of records with the same name, type, and class. For RRsets, the specification is clear about ordering:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The order of RRs in a set is not significant, and need not be preserved by name servers, resolvers, or other parts of the DNS.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, RFC 1034 doesnât clearly specify how message sections relate to RRsets. While modern DNS specifications have shown that message sections can indeed contain multiple RRsets (consider DNSSEC responses with signatures), RFC 1034 doesnât describe message sections in those terms. Instead, it treats message sections as containing individual Resource Records (RRs).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The problem is that the RFC primarily discusses ordering in the context of RRsets but doesn't specify the ordering of different RRsets relative to each other within a message section. This is where the ambiguity lives.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;RFC 1034 section 6.2.1 includes an example that demonstrates this ambiguity further. It mentions that the order of Resource Records (RRs) is not significant either:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The difference in ordering of the RRs in the answer section is not significant.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, this example only shows two A records for the same name within the same RRset. It doesn't address whether this applies to different record types like CNAMEs and A records.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It turns out that this issue extends beyond putting CNAME records before other record types. Even when CNAMEs appear before other records, sequential parsing can still break if the CNAME chain itself is out of order. Consider the following response:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;;; QUESTION SECTION:
;; www.example.com.              IN    A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
cdn.example.com.           3600  IN    CNAME  server.cdn-provider.com.
www.example.com.           3600  IN    CNAME  cdn.example.com.
server.cdn-provider.com.   300   IN    A      198.51.100.1
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Each CNAME belongs to a different RRset, as they have different owners, so the statement about RRset order being insignificant doesnât apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, RFC 1034 doesn't specify that CNAME chains must appear in any particular order. There's no requirement that &lt;code&gt;www.example.com. CNAME cdn.example.com.&lt;/code&gt; must appear before &lt;code&gt;cdn.example.com. CNAME server.cdn-provider.com.&lt;/code&gt;. With sequential parsing, the same issue occurs:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Find records for &lt;code&gt;www.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ignore &lt;code&gt;cdn.example.com. CNAME server.cdn-provider.com&lt;/code&gt;. as it doesnât match the expected name&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Encounter &lt;code&gt;www.example.com. CNAME cdn.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Find records for &lt;code&gt;cdn.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ignore &lt;code&gt;server.cdn-provider.com. A 198.51.100.1&lt;/code&gt; as it doesnât match the expected name&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What should resolvers do?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;RFC 1034 section 5 describes resolver behavior. Section 5.2.2 specifically addresses how resolvers should handle aliases (CNAMEs): &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In most cases a resolver simply restarts the query at the new name when it encounters a CNAME.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This suggests that resolvers should restart the query upon finding a CNAME, regardless of where it appears in the response. However, it's important to distinguish between different types of resolvers:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Recursive resolvers, like 1.1.1.1, are full DNS resolvers that perform recursive resolution by querying authoritative nameservers&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Stub resolvers, like glibcâs getaddrinfo, are simplified local interfaces that forward queries to recursive resolvers and process the responses&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The RFC sections on resolver behavior were primarily written with full resolvers in mind, not the simplified stub resolvers that most applications actually use. Some stub resolvers evidently donât implement certain parts of the spec, such as the CNAME-restart logic described in the RFC. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The DNSSEC specifications provide contrast&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Later DNS specifications demonstrate a different approach to defining record ordering. RFC 4035, which defines protocol modifications for DNSSEC, uses more explicit language:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When placing a signed RRset in the Answer section, the name server MUST also place its RRSIG RRs in the Answer section. The RRSIG RRs have a higher priority for inclusion than any other RRsets that may have to be included.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The specification uses "MUST" and explicitly defines "higher priority" for RRSIG records. However, "higher priority for inclusion" refers to whether RRSIGs should be included in the response, not where they should appear. This provides unambiguous guidance to implementers about record inclusion in DNSSEC contexts, while not mandating any particular behavior around record ordering.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For unsigned zones, however, the ambiguity from RFC 1034 remains. The word "preface" has guided implementation behavior for nearly four decades, but it has never been formally specified as a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do CNAME records come first?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While in our interpretation the RFCs do not require CNAMEs to appear in any particular order, itâs clear that at least some widely-deployed DNS clients rely on it. As some systems using these clients might be updated infrequently, or never updated at all, we believe itâs best to require CNAME records to appear in-order before any other records.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Based on what we have learned during this incident, we have reverted the CNAME re-ordering and do not intend to change the order in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To prevent any future incidents or confusion, we have written a proposal in the form of an Internet-Draft to be discussed at the IETF. If consensus is reached on the clarified behavior, this would become an RFC that explicitly defines how to correctly handle CNAMEs in DNS responses, helping us and the wider DNS community navigate the protocol. The proposal can be found at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-jabley-dnsop-ordered-answer-section. If you have suggestions or feedback we would love to hear your opinions, most usefully via the DNSOP working group at the IETF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;# a brief history of ralph&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dex · January 6, 2026 · &amp;lt; 10 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ralph Wiggum Technique, created by Geoff Huntley, went viral in the final weeks of 2025. Here's the story of ralph since the first time I met Geoff in June of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been messing with ralph since ~June 2025. Here's my story and what I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tl;dr&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jan 1 2026 - If you wanna skip to the end, I did a deep dive on ralph w/ Geoff Huntley on Jan 1 2026. It talks through the history, cursed lang, and compares the original bash-loop ralph implementation with the anthropic stop-hook implementation. You can check it out here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### June 19th 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I attend a meetup with about 15 members of a Twitter GC where we talk about agentic coding. It's the first time I see context7, WisprFlow, specstory, taskmaster, and a whole bunch of other tools and addons, some of which are now quite mainstream. One of our engineers demos an early TUI for Claude approvals and what becomes the foundation of research / plan / implement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are about 3 hours of presentations. Geoff shows up 2 hours late and presents last. He completely steals the show, diving deep on ralph, cursed lang (at the time, the compiler stack is written in Rust), livestreaming autonomous coding overnight while asleep in Australia, subagents in amp code, the virtues of drinking 3 margaritas and shouting at cursor, and much, much more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geoff talks about the "overbaking" phenomenon. If you leave ralph running too long, you end up with all sorts of bizarre emergent behavior, like post-quantum cryptography support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has dimensions of art, deep engineering, the embrace of chaos, and the raw and authentic joy of making a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All ~15 of us have a long and (imo) somewhat unsettling conversation about the future of software dev—about how easy it is to take a SaaS and copy 80-90% of it, and about how many types of work are about to change or disappear entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### July 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geoff Launches ralph in an official blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It includes the basic bash loop structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;while :; do cat PROMPT.md | npx --yes @sourcegraph/amp ; done&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I send it to everyone I know. I hint at it to a few others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It includes a very lightweight example of one of the prompts (this one came later in the language dev, as far as I can tell, since its about the stdlib)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, it included an ask (paraphrasing here as it appears to be gone now)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;you could probably find the cursed lang repo on github if you looked for it, but please don't share it yet&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### August 2025 - Advanced Context Engineering for Coding agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you were early to the coding agents poweruser game, you might have seen Getting AI to work in complex codebases on hackernews and the youtube talk it was based on&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It references ralph and why its such an important example of why engineering your context window is such a high-leverage activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ralph is also a great example of using declarative specifications over imperative instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### August 2025 - hacking productivity tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love hacking on Getting Things Done (GTD) and other productivity systems. I for whatever reason am still stuck on omnifocus which is an ancient but well-honed implementation of the system. But I have always longed for an AI native version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a half-pager on what I wanted, I had ralph write the specs from that, and I had another ralph build the implementation from the specs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't really read the specs, and I didn't read the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The output sucked. I went back to read the specs and they were way off base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's fine it was a saturday morning toy thing, but I learned stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if the specs are bad, the results will be meh&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if you don't actually know your desired end state workflows and how you will test it, you probably won't know what to do when its done&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if you are iterating/exploring, you probably don't want ralph in the first place&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### August 2025 - we put a coding agent in a while loop and it shipped 6 repos overnight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may recall this HN discussion - we put a coding agent in a while loop and it shipped 6 repos overnight - here's the original post simon and I wrote up at repomirrorhq/repomirror&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### August 2025 - testing ralph for a refactor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a few experiments with ralph for side projects, but the most interestinng one was this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An engineer was complaining that the frontend code was messy and was hard to work in, sprawling patterns, long components, etc&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I spent about 30 minutes back and forth with claude developing a REACT_CODING_STANDARDS.md&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I spent another 30 minutes working with the engineer (who has a lot more react experience than I do) to refine and update this doc&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I launched a ralph with a prompt "make sure the code base matches the standards" prompt.md&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Over the next 6 hours, it developed a REACT_REFACTOR_PLAN.md and blasted through the whole thing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I checked in after 6 hours and it claimed to be finished, so I stopped it and sent it over to team for a look.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Overall the feedback was positive, but the PR quickly got some merge conflicts and so we never ended up merging it - you can view the closed PR here&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lesson - code is cheap - the easier alternative to "merge/rebase" is just to re-run the ralph loop on the fresh code with the same prompt and re-open a PR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lesson - for existing codebases, make the change set manageable - we have since set up any ralph-ish desired state loops to once ONCE on a cron overnight, and merge small iterations over time. Waking up to one small refactor every morning is better than both a) waking up to none and b) waking up to 50.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See also: Ron Jeffries: Refactoring -- Not on the backlog!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### September 2025 - cursed lang launch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September 2025, Geoff launches cursed lang officially, the programming language that ralph built. Once in C, once in rust, and then finally in zig. It has a standard library and a stage-2 compiler (cursed lang compiler written in cursed lang).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the Cursed Lang Homepage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside - I want to do a cursed lang hackathon next time Geoff is in SF - stay tune or ping me on X if this is something you're be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### October 2025 - Claude Anonymous SF&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a 5-minute ralph presentation at claude code anonymous in sf, in a room full of some of the most creative and enterprising claude code and codex users in town. steipete came all the way out from Austria to co-host with the Sentry folks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's hard to capture the glory of ralph in a 5 minute lightning talk. But even if all the context engineering concepts get missed, its always a fun time because of the deep art Geoff put into it the naming and branding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highlight was a question from the audience "so do you recommend this?" - my answer: "well, I believe you should try everything". Perhaps the point is not the 5-line bash loop. Perhaps the point is dumb things can work surprisingly well, so what could we expect from a smart version of the thing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### October 2025 - AI That Works w/ Geoff Huntley&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was annoyed that I couldn't really do ralph justice in 5 minutes, so I wrangled Vaibhav and Geoff to do a 75-minute podcast deep diving on ralph and why it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talk a lot about context windows, control loops, and various applications of the technique - refactoring, spec generation, new project setup, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a fun time. You can watch it here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's some code samples here&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### December 2025 - Anthropic Plugin Launches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point the anthropic team released an official ralph wiggum plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people tweeted at Geoff about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I test it out. I am disappointed. It dies in cryptic ways unless you have &lt;code&gt;--dangerously-skip-permissions&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It installs hooks in weird places you can't find, uses a strange markdown file to track state, and adds an opaque stop hook for all claude sessions in a directory until you disable it. If you, in trying to stop it, delete the markdown file before stopping it, you break claude in that repo until you disable the plugin entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond that, it misses the key point of ralph which is not "run forever" but in "carve off small bits of work into independent context windows".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I look forward to see more from Anthropic on this in the future, but for now I'll keep my 5-line bash loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### December 2025 - Youtube Slop Everywhere&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were quickly ralph wiggum videos everywhere. Most of them are typical youtube ai hype-slop:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually like Matt Pockock's youtube overview because its true to the OG technique, and Matt does a good job of grounding the technique in a workflow like kanban, requirements discovery, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### Jan 1 2026 - Ralph Wiggum Showdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So much ralph hype, I decided to give the official plugin another shot. I posted this graphic on twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To my pleasant surprise, Geoff texted me and was like "okay I can jump on for the first 30 minutes or so".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here ya go, a bonafide ralph wiggum yap, the whole story, why it works, with whiteboards and live examples for a side project I'm working on called &lt;code&gt;kustomark&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the repos that got built. I still haven't gotten around to evaluating which one, if any, actually solves my problem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### What's next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still need to do a deep dive on what was built on the showdown stream. That's coming in the next few days, hopefully, because the kustomark plugin is a thing I actually want+need for some projects we're exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should mess with this stuff. It's not exactly the future, but its an imporant slice through a bunch of important concepts that will make you a better Agentic Coder and a better AI Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### Okay one more thing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A gift and a shameless plug - a lot of you are sitting around on the waitlist wondering "when the heck is codelayer gonna actually launch". Quick update there - we're still working hard in the trenches with customers, and learning a lot that has led us to reexamine the entire product. However I am very proud of the OG codelayer and we have many many very happy users on the free private beta. So -- with the disclaimer that we will likely sunset the current beta in favor of a new thing we're launching soon -- if you read this far and you wanna try codelayer - check out the docs at https://hlyr.dev/docs and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excited to share what's next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the mean time, happy ralphing. Hurry up before it gets semantically diffused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-dex&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### PPS&lt;/head&gt;
