  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally posted: 2025-03-16. View source code for this page here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I've found myself using DuckDB more and more for data processing, to the point where I now use it almost exclusively, usually from within Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're moving towards a simpler world where most tabular data can be processed on a single large machine1 and the era of clusters is coming to an end for all but the largest datasets.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post sets out some of my favourite features of DuckDB that set it apart from other SQL-based tools. In a nutshell, it's simple to install, ergonomic, fast, and more fully featured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An earlier post explains why I favour SQL over other APIs such as Polars, pandas or dplyr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuckDB is an open source in-process SQL engine that is optimised for analytics queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The performance difference of analytics-optimised engines (OLAP) vs. transactions-optimised engines (OLTP) should not be underestimated. A query running in DuckDB can be 100 or even 1,000 times faster than exactly the same query running in (say) SQLite or Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A core use-case of DuckDB is where you have one or more large datasets on disk in formats like &lt;code&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;parquet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; which you want to batch process.  You may want to perform cleaning, joins, aggregation, derivation of new columns - that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can also use DuckDB for many other simpler tasks like viewing a csv file from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuckDB consistently benchmarks as one of the fastest data processing engines. The benchmarks I've seen3 show there's not much in it between the leading open source engines - which at the moment seem to be polars, DuckDB, DataFusion, Spark and Dask. Spark and Dask can be competitive on large data, but slower on small data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuckDB itself is a single precompiled binary. In Python, it can be &lt;code&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt;ed with no dependencies.  This makes it a joy to install compared to other more heavyweight options like Spark.  Combined with &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;, you can stand up a fresh DuckDB Python environment from nothing in less than a second - see here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its speed and almost-zero startup time, DuckDB is ideally suited for CI and testing of data engineering pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically this has been fiddly and running a large suite of tests in e.g. Apache Spark has been time consuming and frustrating. Now it's much simpler to set up the test environment, and there's less scope for differences between it and your production pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simplicity and speed also applies to writing new SQL, and getting syntax right before running it on a large dataset. Historically I have found this annoying in engines like Spark (where it takes a few seconds to start Spark in local mode), or even worse when you're forced to run queries in a proprietary tool like AWS Athena.4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's even a DuckDB UI with autocomplete - see here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DuckDB team has implemented a wide range of innovations in its SQL dialect that make it a joy to use. See the following blog posts 1 2 3 4 5 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of my favourites are the &lt;code&gt;EXCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and the &lt;code&gt;COLUMNS&lt;/code&gt; keyword which allows you to select and regex-replace a subset of columns.5  I also like &lt;code&gt;QUALIFY&lt;/code&gt; and the aggregate modifiers on window functions, see here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is the ability to function chain, like &lt;code&gt;first_name.lower().trim()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can query data directly from files, including on s3, or on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example to query a folder of parquet files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;select *from read_parquet('path/to/*.parquet')&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;or even (on CORS enabled files) you can run SQL directly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;select *from read_parquet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2015_flights.parquet')limit 2;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click here to try this query yourself in the DuckDB web shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways to cause problems in your data pipelines is to fail to be strict about incoming data types from untyped formats such as csv. DuckDB provides lots of options here - see here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many data pipelines effectively boil down to a long sequence of CTEs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;WITHinput_data AS (SELECT * FROM read_parquet('...')),step_1 AS (SELECT ... FROM input_data JOIN ...),step_2 AS (SELECT ... FROM step_1)SELECT ... FROM step_2;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When developing a pipeline like this, we often want to inspect what's happened at each step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Python, we can write&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;input_data = duckdb.sql("SELECT * FROM read_parquet('...')")step_1 = duckdb.sql("SELECT ... FROM input_data JOIN ...")step_2 = duckdb.sql("SELECT ... FROM step_1")final = duckdb.sql("SELECT ... FROM step_2;")&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it easy to inspect what the data looks like at &lt;code&gt;step_2&lt;/code&gt; with no performance loss, since these steps will be executed lazily when they're run all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also facilitates easier testing of SQL in CI, since each step can be an independently-tested function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuckDB offers full ACID compliance for bulk data operations, which sets it apart from other analytical data systems - see here. You can listen to more about this on in this podcast, transcribed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting new development, making DuckDB potentially a suitable replacement for lakehouse formats such as Iceberg or Delta lake for medium scale data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longstanding difficulty with data processing engines has been the difficulty in writing high performance user defined functions (UDFs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in PySpark, you will generally get best performance by writing custom Scala, compiling to a JAR, and registering it with Spark. But this is cumbersome and in practice, you will encounter a lot of issues around Spark version compatibility and security restrictions environments such as DataBricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In DuckDB high performance custom UDFs can be written in C++. Whilst writing these functions is certainly not trivial, DuckDB community extensions offers a low-friction way of distributing the code. Community extensions can be installed almost instantly with a single command such as &lt;code&gt;INSTALL h3 FROM community&lt;/code&gt; to install hierarchical hexagonal indexing for geospatial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team provide documentation as a single markdown file so it can easily be provided to an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My top tip: if you load this file in your code editor, and use code folding, it's easy to copy the parts of the documentation you need into context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this blog post is based on my experience supporting multiple SQL dialects in Splink, an open source library for record linkage at scale. We've found that transitioning towards recommending DuckDB as the default backend choice has increased adoption of the library and significantly reduced the amount of problems faced by users, even for large linkage tasks, whilst speeding up workloads very substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've also found it's hugely increased the simplicity and speed of developing and testing new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_duckdb&lt;/code&gt; allows you to embed the DuckDB computation engine within Postgres.&lt;p&gt;The later in particular seems potentially extremely powerful, enabling Postgres to be simultanouesly optimised for analytics and transactional processing. I think it's likely to see widespread adoption, especially after they iron out a few of the current shortcomings around enabling and optimising the use of Postgres indexes and pushing up filters up to PostGres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a long-time Spark user, I am glad to be rid of needing to know lots of intricate configuration options for Spark tuning ��↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 192 core processors such as this available in the cloud and only costing around $15,000, the complexity of clusters can be avoided unless you have genuinely huge data. It's also worth noting there is actually now a distributed version of DuckDB, see here. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance see here, here and here/discussion. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Athena is a very powerful and useful tool. I just find it frustrating for developing and quickly iterating queries of moderate complexity. An example of why it's easier in DuckDB is this kind of reprex. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, we can select all columns prefixed with &lt;code&gt;emp_&lt;/code&gt; and rename to remove the prefix as follows: &lt;code&gt;SELECT COLUMNS('emp_(.*)') AS '\1'&lt;/code&gt; ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Patching the Wii News Channel to serve local news in 2025&lt;/head&gt;August 25, 2025&lt;p&gt;🎧 Now Playing: Menu (News Channel) via Nintendo Music App&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In keeping with my passion (?) for displaying local news articles in unexpected places, I figured it would be a fun project to try and see what it would take to display current local news on the Nintendo Wii console’s News Channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sneak peek at the result:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’d like to share my research and process for getting this all to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;tl;dr - click to expand (spoilers)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patched the News Channel’s hardcoded Nintendo URL to point to an S3 storage bucket using Go and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wadlib&lt;/code&gt;to extract the necessary binary file and edit it in-memory&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modified WiiLink’s open-source news file generator to add “El Nuevo Día” as a news source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up AWS Lambda + EventBridge to regenerate the necessary news binary files hourly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source code: WiiNewsPR and WiiNewsPR-Patcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Wii’s News Channel&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The News Channel debuted in North America on January 26, 2007, a little over two months after the Wii’s launch. Since that date, it mostly came pre-installed with Wii consoles and was a novel way to read news from all over the world. Together with other “utility” channels like the Forecast Channel, it tried to position the Wii as more than just a gaming console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out a video recording of the service from right before it was discontinued on June 27th, 2013:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How the News Channel fetches content&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we can consider displaying custom news on it, we have to figure out how the News Channel actually fetches content. We know that it must have fetched news somehow since it displays a “Downloading…” splash screen on startup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for us, the Wii natively supports proxying via its internet connection configuration settings! Meaning we can set up something like mitmproxy on a local machine and observe its HTTP behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can start &lt;code&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/code&gt;’s web interface for a more screenshot-friendly UI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mitmweb --listen-port 8080
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we run a man-in-the-middle proxy for the News Channel on an unmodified Wii, we will observe that, on channel startup, it attempts to obtain a &lt;code&gt;news.bin.00&lt;/code&gt; file from &lt;code&gt;http://news.wapp.wii.com/v2/1/049/news.bin.00&lt;/code&gt; via a plain HTTP request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;URL path explainer (we’ll see later how I found this out):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;corresponds to “English” as the configured console language. See conf.h in&lt;code&gt;devkitPro&lt;/code&gt;(the Wii homebrew community’s de-facto development toolchain) for the possible values.&lt;code&gt;049&lt;/code&gt;is the Wii’s country code for “United States”. Check out the full list of Wii country codes on wiibrew.org.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it fails to fetch this file, the News Channel displays an error. What might these binary files be? In any case, seeing the Wii perform an HTTP request to fetch news data is a good sign for us. It means we might be able to serve our own data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you run an internet connection test after configuring the proxy settings correctly, you’ll spot the Wii performing an HTTP request to http://conntest.nintendowifi.net. Turns out, this page is actually still online (see for yourself!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wii’s internet connection test still passes to this day without any modification required. Thanks, Nintendo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enter WiiLink: the homebrew community keeping Wii online services alive&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, this is how we would expect the Wii would behave if you were running a stock console. More than 12 years ago, Nintendo discontinued support for the online functionality of the News Channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as expected for a beloved retro console, community efforts have sprung up to try and preserve the previously existing functionality and allow users to continue enjoying these systems well past their intended expiration date. These sorts of unofficial software for gaming consoles are commonly referred to as “homebrew”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly for this project, the WiiLink team maintains servers and develops software that allows us to experience the Wii’s online connectivity features even today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you’re curious about how to get started with Wii console homebrew, check out https://wii.hacks.guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to WiiLink, we can revive the News Channel and browse up-to-date news! Just not the local news, which is our real goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How WiiLink patches the News Channel&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After going through the WiiLink install process, if we fire up &lt;code&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/code&gt; and take a look at what the Wii is doing now, we’ll see that it’s actually requesting files from a different domain: “news.wiilink.ca”. But this time, it manages to fetch &lt;code&gt;news.bin.00&lt;/code&gt; and keeps requesting files all the way up to &lt;code&gt;news.bin.23&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The News Channel just successfully fetched 24 hours worth of news from this server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great! Somehow, the WiiLink folks got this all to work. And, best of all, they’ve opened-sourced their work (GitHub). The plan is looking really feasible at this point!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a high-level, there are two steps to tackle, then:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;We have to make the News Channel fetch files from a server we control&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;We need to actually generate binary files with the content we want&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 1: Patching the News Channel to redirect to our domain&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we follow along with WiiLink’s installation guide, the critical step seems to be installing a patched version of the News Channel. Looking at their GitHub org, we find a WiiLink24-Patcher project. Searching for the “News Channel” in the source code, we find this line in patch.cs which references a VCDIFF encoded &lt;code&gt;News_1.delta&lt;/code&gt; patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side note - it’s only while writing this blog post that I realized I had been looking at the “wrong” repo; WiiLink’s guide now recommends using the Python-based WiiLink-Patcher-GUI instead of the CLI patcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After downloading the &lt;code&gt;.delta&lt;/code&gt; file locally, we can use the xdelta CLI to print out some information on what the patch is supposed to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;xdelta3 printdelta News_1.delta

VCDIFF version:               0
VCDIFF header size:           29
VCDIFF header indicator:      VCD_APPHEADER
VCDIFF secondary compressor:  lzma
VCDIFF application header:    news.dol//0000000b.app/
XDELTA filename (output):     news.dol
XDELTA filename (source):     0000000b.app
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we’re looking for a &lt;code&gt;0000000b.app&lt;/code&gt; file and want to save the patched binary as &lt;code&gt;news.dol&lt;/code&gt;. Based on the WiiLink install instructions, we know we should be dealing with a &lt;code&gt;WAD&lt;/code&gt; file, so let’s keep digging to see if we can find out where &lt;code&gt;0000000b.app&lt;/code&gt; might be hiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the WAD file format on wiibrew.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the repo’s &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;, we know the patcher uses libWiiSharp for it’s WAD file management during the file patching processing (source). But at this point, I’d rather avoid using C# if I can. And besides, I know for a fact we’ll want to use Go in order to more easily leverage existing tooling from the WiiLink team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there’s a really handy Go library called wadlib that comes to the rescue here. We’ll be using it for all our WAD management needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where is &lt;code&gt;0000000b.app&lt;/code&gt;? Looking at LibWiiSharp’s &lt;code&gt;WAD.cs&lt;/code&gt; file, we can spot how it unpacks &lt;code&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; files from a WAD file. Namely, it defaults to using the numeric “Content ID” inside each “Content” metadata and then converts it to an 8-digit hexadecimal string (source).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read more about Title metadata (“TMD”) and Content metadata (“CMD”) on wiibrew.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with this knowledge, we can use &lt;code&gt;wadlib&lt;/code&gt; to create a quick file extraction script and see if we can find our &lt;code&gt;0000000b.app&lt;/code&gt;. It can go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// ignore error handling for brevity
wad, _ := wadlib.LoadWADFromFile("news.wad")
titleMetadata := wad.TMD
contentMetadata := titleMetadata.Contents

outputDir := "extracted_wad/"
os.MkdirAll(outputDir, 0755)

for i := 0; i &amp;lt; len(wad.Data); i++ {
  data, _ := wad.GetContent(i)

  contentID := contentMetadata[i].ID

  // "%08x" means 0-padded 8 digit hex
  filename := filepath.Join(outputDir, fmt.Sprintf("%08x.app", contentID))
  _ = os.WriteFile(filename, data, 0644)

  log.Printf("Extracted: %08x.app (size: %d bytes)",
    contentID, len(data))
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;news.wad&lt;/code&gt; is the official (v7) News Channel WAD file, this script successfully extracts 12 &lt;code&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s definitely a &lt;code&gt;0000000b.app&lt;/code&gt; there, but could it be the file we’re looking for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we really need to do at this point is go ahead and apply the &lt;code&gt;News_1.delta&lt;/code&gt; patch to this &lt;code&gt;0000000b.app&lt;/code&gt; file manually. That way, we can compare the before/after binaries and see what changed. We can use &lt;code&gt;xdelta&lt;/code&gt; again to actually apply the patch. Running &lt;code&gt;xdelta3 --help&lt;/code&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;apply patch:
  xdelta3.exe -d -s old_file delta_file decoded_new_file
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we can go ahead and run:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;xdelta3 -d -s extracted_wad/0000000b.app News_1.delta news.dol
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that… seemed to work? We have a &lt;code&gt;news.dol&lt;/code&gt; file, as expected. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Investigating binary file changes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could do a binary diff of these files and start going through each change, but we already know at least one thing that should have changed based on our previous &lt;code&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/code&gt; experiments: instead of performing requests to “news.wapp.wii.com”, the patched WAD should instead use “news.wiilink.ca”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a tool like Hex Fiend (which also has binary diffing capabilities in case we need them), we can try searching for text inside the binary. If we try searching for “news.wapp.wii.com” on the original &lt;code&gt;0000000b.app&lt;/code&gt; file, we can actually find a match!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, if we inspect the patched &lt;code&gt;news.dol&lt;/code&gt; file we will find no mention of the original URL. Instead, the “http://news.wiilink.ca” domain is visible at the same location (offset &lt;code&gt;0x1AC37C&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the URL contains only two printf-style format strings (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%d&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;%03d&lt;/code&gt;); the News Channel itself must be appending the hourly suffix (like&lt;code&gt;.00&lt;/code&gt;) when fetching data.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we’re lucky, simply overwriting the binary file’s original URL with our own custom URL might do the trick. It’s worth a try!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to validate this hypothesis, I wrote a small Go utility for performing the necessary text replacement. Here’s an excerpt of the important bits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// ignoring error handling for brevity
const OriginalURL = "http://news.wapp.wii.com/v2/%d/%03d/news.bin"
const NewURL = "http://wii.rauln.com/news/%d/%03d/news.bin"

wad, _ := wadlib.LoadWADFromFile(wadPath)

// Get decrypted content at index 1 (record with ID "0000000b")
content, _ := wad.GetContent(1)

// byte slice of 44 bytes
originalContent := []byte(OriginalURL)

// 43 bytes in our URL's case
newContent := []byte(NewURL)

// Pad the new URL to match original length (44 bytes)
paddedURL := make([]byte, len(originalContent))
copy(paddedURL, newContent)

// Find the offset (index) of the URL to patch inside the byte slice
offset := bytes.Index(content, originalContent)

// Patch the URL
copy(content[offset:offset+len(originalContent)], paddedURL)
_ = wad.UpdateContent(1, content)

// Save the updated WAD file
_ = os.WriteFile(outputPath, wadBytes, 0644)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the full source on GitHub: WiiNewsPR-Patcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we run the utility like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;go build
wiinewspr-patcher news.wad patched_news.wad
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should perform the URL rewriting in memory and provide us with a valid WAD file (&lt;code&gt;patched_news.wad&lt;/code&gt;) we can then go ahead and install on Wii hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can install the patched WAD on our Wii console using YAWM (ModMii Edition).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can go back to running &lt;code&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/code&gt; and opening the newly patched News Channel. Once the channel shows the “Downloading…” splash screen, we’ll spot requests going out to our expected domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works! Now all we need is to… actually generate valid news files for the News Channel to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 2: Generating News Channel compatible news files&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned previously that I knew using Go would come in handy later, and it’s specifically because the WiiLink team has a project called NewsChannel written in Go which contains the source code for generating the binary news files they serve from “news.wiilink.ca”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to go over all the implementation details here. I just want to highlight some of the main file creation steps in case you’d like to read more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;obtain country-specific configuration (source)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;obtain articles and metadata from configured sources (like NHK, source)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;process all data in a specific order into a bytes buffer (source)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;compress the data using LZ10, sign it with RSA, then write to disk (source) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;the file name is written using a specific string interpolation (source, this is how I first found out about the language/country codes used in the News Channel data URL!)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: LZ10 is apparently a Nintendo-specific variant of the LZ77 compression algorithm, used in some form or another on Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and Wii systems. wii-tools/lzx has the Go source for the LZ10 compression used here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, for our purposes, it’s doing more than we need in terms of source handling: it can generate news binaries from a variety of sources and supports different languages and regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this project, I am making the following assumptions and tradeoffs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will be using “English” as the language and “US” as the country code for the source URL path since my Wii console is configured as such. There is no separate Puerto Rico country code option, which is curious considering that there is a separate option for the US Virgin Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not interested in supporting any other news sources from around the world, so the “Globe” feature for the News Channel will not be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m hardcoding the latitude and longitude of Puerto Rico’s capital into the binary file to avoid having to process or guess location data from each article entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Modifying WiiLink’s generator to support Puerto Rican news&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went ahead and forked the &lt;code&gt;NewsChannel&lt;/code&gt; repo into WiiNewsPR, added flag support to control article caching and binary output paths (you’ll see why this was necessary soon), removed all the existing sources and added a new one: El Nuevo Día (“ENDI”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I picked ENDI only because it’s the only local newspaper website I could find which still supports RSS. Unfortunately, the feeds only contain a snippet of the actual article. On the bright side, most articles do contain images and we can use separate feeds to help categorize articles in the News Channel (source).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, I experimented with GoOse for (spanish language) article extraction on other news websites and the results were… unsatisfying, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Final setup requirements for proper News Channel support&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two quick things we’ll need in order to get this all to work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;We need to sign each binary news file with a custom RSA key for the Wii to process the file (source). We can use &lt;code&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt;for this (note the&lt;code&gt;-traditional&lt;/code&gt;option):&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt; openssl genrsa -traditional -out Private.pem 2048
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;We need a (really) low quality logo for our source. ImageMagick easily solves for this:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;magick logo.svg -quality 30 -resize 200x200 -strip logo.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, we can use Go embeds to include the logo in the Go binary (source).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can build the Go binary and run it in order to generate a news binary in &lt;code&gt;./v2/1/049&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;go build
./WiiNewsPR
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This successfully generates a &lt;code&gt;news.bin.NN&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we just need 24 of these, since the News Channel will actually fail to load if not provided with all 24 files. We could run this script every hour for the next 24 hours… or, we could take the shortcut of copying the current hour’s file into all other hourly values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it’s about time to test out all this effort. With 24 files uploaded to our storage provider (AWS S3), and the patched News Channel configured to fetch these from our custom domain, we can start up the channel and observe the fruits of our labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the (slow!) requests finish one by one, seeing the articles pop up was immensely satisfying. Being able to tinker with and learn more about these nostalgic consoles so many years later is a real joy for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus step: Automating hourly news updates with AWS Lambda&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copying files into the S3 storage bucket is all well and good, but it would be great to have a continuously-updating, hands-off solution that generates the news binaries for us. A simple (and basically free) way to solve for this would be to bundle up the &lt;code&gt;WiiNewsPR&lt;/code&gt; Go executable into an AWS Lambda function and have that run hourly via EventBride, and then uploading the generated news binaries over to our storage bucket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is where the extra flags for &lt;code&gt;WiiNewsPR&lt;/code&gt; come in: we need to be able to control file creation because &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; is a Lambda’s only writeable file system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a snippet of the Lambda handler logic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;func Handler(ctx context.Context) error {
  cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, "./WiiNewsPR", "-o", "/tmp", "-c", "/tmp/cache")
  // ...

  _, err = uploader.Upload(ctx, &amp;amp;s3.PutObjectInput{
		Bucket:      aws.String(bucketName),
		Key:         aws.String(fmt.Sprintf("%snews.bin.%s", keyPrefix, hour)),
		Body:        file,
		ContentType: aws.String("application/octet-stream"),
	})
  // ...
}

func main() {
  lambda.Start(Handler)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;See full Lambda handler source on GitHub: handler.go&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can then leverage the Serverless framework for a quick infra-as-code setup. Here is a snippet of the configuration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;service: wiinewspr-generator

    &lt;p&gt;Think back, if you will, to the works of art you created at age twelve or thirteen. For many, perhaps most of us, our output at that stage of adolescence amounted to directionless doodles, chaotic comics, and a few unsteady-at-best school projects. But then, most of us didn’t grow up to be Michelangelo. In the late fourteen-eighties, when that towering Renaissance artist was still what we would now call a “tween,” he painted The Torment of Saint Anthony, a depiction of the titular religious figure beset by demons in the desert. Though based on a widely known engraving, it nevertheless shows evidence of rapidly advancing technique, inspiration, and even creativity — especially when placed under the infrared scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For about half a millennium, The Torment of Saint Anthony wasn’t thought to have been painted by Michelangelo. As explained in the video from Inspiraggio just below, when the painting sold at Sotheby’s in 2008, the buyer took it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for examination and cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Beneath the layers of dirt accumulated over the centuries,” says the narrator, “a very particular color palette appeared. “The tones, the blends, the way the human figure was treated: all of it began to resemble the style Michelangelo would use years later in none other than the Sistine Chapel.” Infrared reflectography subsequently turned up pentimenti, or correction marks, a common indication that “a painting is not a copy, but an original work created with artistic freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas that first bet big on the provenance of The Torment of Saint Anthony. Its newly hired director purchased the painting after turning up “not a single convincing argument against the attribution.” Thus acquired, it became “the only painting by Michelangelo located anywhere in the Americas, and also just one of four easel paintings attributed to him throughout his entire career,” during most of which he disparaged oil painting itself. About a decade later, and after further analysis, the art historian Giorgio Bonsanti put his considerable authority behind a definitive confirmation that it is indeed the work of the young Michelangelo. There remain doubters, of course, and even the notoriously uncompromising artist himself may have considered it an immature work unworthy of his name. But who else could have created an immature work like it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Astro Technology Company — the company behind the Astro web framework — is joining Cloudflare! Adoption of the Astro web framework continues to double every year, and Astro 6 is right around the corner. With Cloudflare’s support, we’ll have more resources and fewer distractions to continue our mission to build the best framework for content-driven websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this means for Astro:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Astro stays open-source and MIT-licensed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Astro continues to be actively maintained&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Astro continues to support a wide set of deployment targets, not just Cloudflare&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Astro’s open governance and current roadmap remain in place.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All full-time employees of The Astro Technology Company are now employees of Cloudflare, and will continue to work on Astro full-time.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Astro started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, Astro was born out of frustration. The trend at the time was that every website should be architected as an application, and then shipped to the user’s browser to render. This was not very performant, and we’ve spent the last decade coming up with more and more complex solutions to solve for that performance problem. SSR, ISR, RSC, PPR, TTI optimizations via code-splitting, tree-shaking, lazy-loading, all to generate a blocking double-data hydration payload from a pre-warmed server running halfway around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our mission to design a web framework specifically for building websites — what we call content-driven websites, to better distinguish from data-driven, stateful web applications — resonated. Now Astro is downloaded almost 1,000,000 times per week, and has been used by 100,000s of developers to build fast, beautiful websites. Today you’ll find Astro all over the web, powering major websites and even entire developer platforms for companies like Webflow, Wix, Microsoft, and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along the way, we also tried to grow a business. In 2021 we raised some money and formed The Astro Technology Company. Our larger vision was that a well-designed framework like Astro could sit at the center of a massive developer platform, with optional hosted primitives (database, storage, analytics) designed in lockstep with the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were never able to realize this vision. Attempts to introduce paid, hosted primitives into our ecosystem fell flat, and rarely justified their own existence. We considered going more directly after first-class hosting or content management for Astro, but knew we’d spend much of our time playing catchup to well-funded, savvy competitors. We kept exploring different ideas, but nothing clicked with users the same way Astro did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all bad. Astro DB (our attempt to build a hosted database product for Astro projects) eventually evolved into the open, built-in Astro database client that still lives in core today. Our exploration into building an e-commerce layer with Astro was eventually open-sourced. It was rewarding work, but over the years the distraction took its toll. Each attempt at a new paid product or offering took myself and others on the project away from working on the Astro framework that developers were using and loving every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Returning to Focus&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, Dane (Cloudflare CTO) and I began to talk more seriously about the future of the web. Those conversations quickly grew into something bigger: What does the next decade look like? How do frameworks adapt to a world of AI coding and agents?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It became clear that even as web technologies evolve, content remains at the center. We realized that we’ve each been working toward this same vision from different angles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cloudflare has been solving it from the infrastructure side: betting on a platform that is global by default, with fast startup, low latency, and security built-in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Astro has been solving it from the framework side: betting on a web framework that makes it easy to build sites that are fast by default, without overcomplicating things.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The overlap is obvious. By working together, Cloudflare gives us the backing we need to keep innovating for our users. Now we can stop spending cycles worrying about building a business on top of Astro, and start focusing 100% on the code, with a shared vision to move the web forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cloudflare ❤️ Astro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has been a long-time sponsor and champion of Astro. They have a proven track record of supporting great open-source projects like Astro, TanStack, and Hono without trying to capture or lock anything down. Staying open to all was a non-negotiable requirement for both us and for Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why Astro will remain free, open-source, and MIT-licensed. We will continue to run our project in the open, with an open governance model for contributors and an open community roadmap that anyone can participate in. We remain fully committed to maintaining Astro as a platform-agnostic framework, meaning we will continue to support and improve deployments for all targets—not just Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Cloudflare’s resources and support, we can now return our focus fully towards building the best web framework for content-driven websites. The web is changing fast, and the bar keeps rising: performance, scale, reliability, and a better experience for the teams shipping content on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll see that focus reflected across our roadmap, as we prepare for the upcoming Astro 6 release (beta out now!) and our 2026 roadmap. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thank you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to extend a huge thank you to the agencies, companies, sponsors, partners, and theme authors who chose to work with us over the years. Thank you to our initial investors — Haystack, Gradient, Uncorrelated, Lightspeed — without whom Astro likely wouldn’t exist. Thank you to everyone in our open source community who continues to help make Astro better every day. And finally, thank you to everyone who uses Astro and puts their trust in us to help them build for the web.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2026-01-16&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Cursor's latest "browser experiment" implied success without evidence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On January 14th 2026, Cursor published a blog post titled "Scaling long-running autonomous coding" (https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the blog post, they talk about their experiments with running "coding agents autonomously for weeks" with the explicit goal of&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;understand[ing] how far we can push the frontier of agentic coding for projects that typically take human teams months to complete&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They talk about some approaches they tried, why they think those failed, and how to address the difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally they arrived at a point where something "solved most of our coordination problems and let us scale to very large projects without any single agent", which then led to this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore the source code on GitHub (https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where things get a bit murky and unclear. They claim "Despite the codebase size, new agents can still understand it and make meaningful progress" and "Hundreds of workers run concurrently, pushing to the same branch with minimal conflicts", but they never actually say if this is successful or not, is it actually working? Can you run this browser yourself? We don't know and they never say explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this, they embed the following video:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And below it, they say "While it might seem like a simple screenshot, building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult.".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;They never actually claim this browser is working and functional&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;error: could not compile 'fastrender' (lib) due to 34 previous errors; 94 warnings emitted&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you try to compile it yourself, you'll see that it's very far away from being a functional browser at all, and seemingly, it never actually was able to build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple recent GitHub Actions runs on &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; show
failures (including workflow-file errors), and independent build
attempts report dozens of compiler errors, recent PRs were all merged
with failing CI, and going back in the Git history from most recent
commit back 100 commits,&lt;lb/&gt;I couldn't find a single commit that compiled cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what the "agents" they unleashed on this codebase actually did, but they seemingly never ran "cargo build" or even less "cargo check", because both of those commands surface 10s of errors (which surely would balloon should we solve them) and about 100 warnings. There is an open GitHub issue in their repository about this right now: https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/issues/98&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And diving into the codebase, if the compilation errors didn't make that clear already, makes it very clear to any software developer that none of this is actually engineered code. It is what is typically known as "AI slop", low quality something that surely represents something, but it doesn't have intention behind it, and it doesn't even compile at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They later start to talk about what's next, but not a single word about how to run it, what to expect, how it's working or anything else. Cursor's blog post provides no reproducible demo and no known-good revision (tag/release/commit) to verify the screenshots, beyond linking the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of intent, Cursor's blog post creates the impression of a functioning prototype while leaving out the basic reproducibility markers one would expect from such claim. They never explicitly claim it's actually working, so no one can say they lied at least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They finish off the article saying:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But the core question, can we scale autonomous coding by throwing more agents at a problem, has a more optimistic answer than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which seems like a really strange conclusion to arrive at, when all they've proved so far, is that agents can output millions of tokens and still not end up with something that actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A "browser experiment" doesn't need to rival Chrome. A reasonable minimum bar is: it compiles on a supported toolchain and can render a trivial HTML file. Cursor's post doesn’t demonstrate that bar, and current public build attempts fail at this too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cursor never says "this browser is production-ready", but they do frame it as "building a web browser from scratch" and "meaningful progress" and then use a screenshot and "extremely difficult" language, wanting to give the impression that this experiment actually was a success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The closest they get to implying that this was a success, is this part:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of agents can work together on a single codebase for weeks, making real progress on ambitious projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this extraordinary claim isn't backed up by any evidence. In the blog post they never provide a working commit, build instructions or even a demo that can be reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think anyone expects this browser to be the next Chrome, but I do think that if you claim you've built a browser, it should at least be able to demonstrate being able to be compiled + loading a basic HTML file at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

+# Cursor's latest "browser experiment" implied success without evidence
+
+On January 14th 2026, Cursor published a blog post titled "Scaling long-running autonomous coding" (https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents)
+
+In the blog post, they talk about their experiments with running "coding agents autonomously for weeks"
+
+with the explicit goal of
+
+&amp;gt; understand[ing] how far we can push the frontier of agentic coding for projects that typically take human teams months to complete
+
+They talk about some approaches they tried, why they think those failed, and how to address the difficulties.
+
+Finally they arrived at a point where something "solved most of our coordination problems and let us scale to very large projects without any single agent", which then led to this:
+
+&amp;gt; To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore the source code on GitHub (https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender)
+
+This is where things get a bit murky and unclear. They claim "Despite the codebase size, new agents can still understand it and make meaningful progress" and "Hundreds of workers run concurrently, pushing to the same branch with minimal conflicts", but they never actually say if this is successful or not, is it actually working? Can you run this browser yourself? We don't know and they never say.
+
+After this, they embed the following video:
+

+
+And below it, they say "While it might seem like a simple screenshot, building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult.".

+
+And if you try to compile it yourself, you'll see that it's very far away from being a functional browser at all, and seemingly, it never actually was able to build. Multiple recent CI workflow runs on `main` are failing, all the PRs were merged with failing CI, and going back in the Git history from most recent commit, I couldn't find a single commit that compiled cleanly.
+
+I'm not sure what the "agents" they unleashed on this codebase actually did, but they seemingly never ran "cargo build" or even less "cargo check", because both of those commands surface 10s of errors (which surely would balloon should we solve them) and about 100 warnings. There is an open GitHub issue in their repository about this right now: https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/issues/98
+
+And diving into the codebase, if the compilation errors didn't make that sure, makes it very clear to any software developer that none of this is actually engineered code. It is what is typically known as "AI slop", low quality *something* that surely represents *something*, but it doesn't have intention behind it, and it doesn't even compile at this point.
+
+They later start to talk about what's next, but not a single word about how to run it, what to expect, how it's working or anything else. Cursor's blog post provides no reproducible demo/build instructions or known-good commit, beyond linking the repo. Regardless of intent, Cursor's blog post creates the impression of a functioning prototype while leaving out the basic reproducibility markers one would expect from such claim. They never explicitly claim it's actually working, so no one can say they lied at least.
+
+They finish off the article saying:
+
+&amp;gt; But the core question, can we scale autonomous coding by throwing more agents at a problem, has a more optimistic answer than we expected.
+
+Which seems like a really strange conclusion to arrive at, when all they've proved so far, is that agents can output millions of tokens and still not end up with something that actually works.
+
+## Conclusion
+
+Cursor never says "this browser is production-ready", but they do frame it as "building a web browser from scratch" and "meaningful progress" and then use a screenshot and "extremely difficult" language, wanting to give the impression that this experiment actually was a success.
+
+The closest they get to implying that this was a success, is this part:
+
+&amp;gt; Hundreds of agents can work together on a single codebase for weeks, making real progress on ambitious projects.
+
+But this extraordinary claim isn't backed up by any evidence. They never provide a working commit, build instructions or even a demo that can reproduced.
+
+I don't think anyone expects this browser to be the next Chrome, but I do think that if you claim you've built a browser, it should at least be able to demonstrate being able to be compiled + loading a basic HTML file at the very least.&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short-lived and IP address certificates are now generally available from Let’s Encrypt. These certificates are valid for 160 hours, just over six days. In order to get a short-lived certificate subscribers simply need to select the ‘shortlived’ certificate profile in their ACME client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short-lived certificates improve security by requiring more frequent validation and reducing reliance on unreliable revocation mechanisms. If a certificate’s private key is exposed or compromised, revocation has historically been the way to mitigate damage prior to the certificate’s expiration. Unfortunately, revocation is an unreliable system so many relying parties continue to be vulnerable until the certificate expires, a period as long as 90 days. With short-lived certificates that vulnerability window is greatly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short-lived certificates are opt-in and we have no plan to make them the default at this time. Subscribers that have fully automated their renewal process should be able to switch to short-lived certificates easily if they wish, but we understand that not everyone is in that position and generally comfortable with this significantly shorter lifetime. We hope that over time everyone moves to automated solutions and we can demonstrate that short-lived certificates work well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our default certificate lifetimes will be going from 90 days down to 45 days over the next few years, as previously announced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IP address certificates allow server operators to authenticate TLS connections to IP addresses rather than domain names. Let’s Encrypt supports both IPv4 and IPv6. IP address certificates must be short-lived certificates, a decision we made because IP addresses are more transient than domain names, so validating more frequently is important. You can learn more about our IP address certificates and the use cases for them from our post announcing our first IP Certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank the Open Technology Fund and Sovereign Tech Agency, along with our Sponsors and Donors, for supporting the development of this work.&lt;/p&gt;

The unique feat was the result of over a year and a half of preparations involving three different balloons, various modifications, and a first, unsuccessful attempt. The failed attempt alerted the East German authorities to the plot, but the police were unable to identify the escapees before their second, successful flight two months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;East Germany, then part of the Eastern Bloc, was separated from West Germany in the Western Bloc by the inner German border and the Berlin Wall, which were heavily fortified with watchtowers, land mines, armed soldiers, and various other measures to prevent illegal crossings. East German border troops were instructed to prevent defection to West Germany by all means, including lethal force (Schießbefehl; "order to fire").[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Strelzyk (1942–2017), an electrician and former East German Air Force mechanic, and Günter Wetzel (born 1955), a bricklayer by trade,[3] were colleagues at a local plastics factory.[4] Friends for four years, they shared a desire to flee the country and began discussing ways to get across the border. On 7 March 1978, they agreed to plan an escape.[5] They considered building a helicopter but quickly realized they would be unable to acquire an engine capable of powering such a craft. They then decided to explore the idea of constructing a hot air balloon,[6] having been inspired by a television program about ballooning.[3] An alternate account is that a relative shared a magazine article about the International Balloon Festival in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Construction&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Strelzyk and Wetzel began research into balloons. Their plan was to escape with their wives and a total of four children (aged 2 to 15). They calculated the weight of the eight passengers and the craft itself to be around 750 kilograms (1,650 lb). Subsequent calculations determined a balloon capable of lifting this weight would need to hold 2,000 cubic metres (71,000 cu ft) of air heated to 100 °C (212 °F). The next calculation was the amount of material needed for the balloon, estimated to be 800 square metres (8,600 sq ft).[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair lived in Pößneck, a small town of about 20,000 where large quantities of cloth could not be obtained without raising attention. They tried neighbouring towns of Rudolstadt, Saalfeld, and Jena without success.[7] They travelled 50 km (31 mi) to Gera, where they purchased 1-metre-wide (3 ft 3 in) rolls of cotton cloth totalling 850 metres (2,790 ft) in length at a department store after telling the astonished clerk that they needed the large quantity of material to use as tent lining for their camping club.[6][7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wetzel spent two weeks sewing the cloth into a balloon-shaped bag, 15 metres (49 ft) wide by 20 metres (66 ft) long, on a 40-year-old manually operated sewing machine. Strelzyk spent the time building the gondola and burner assembly. The gondola was made from an iron frame, sheet metal floor, and clothesline run around the perimeter every 150 millimetres (5.9 in) for the sides. The burner was made using two 11-kilogram (24 lb) bottles of liquid propane household gas, hoses, water pipe, a nozzle, and a piece of stove pipe.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First test&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The team was ready to test the craft in April 1978. After days of searching, they found a suitable secluded forest clearing near Ziegenrück, 10 km (6.2 mi) from the border and 30 km (19 mi) from Pößneck. After lighting the burner one night, they failed to inflate the balloon. They thought the problem might stem from the fact that they had laid the balloon on the ground. After weeks of additional searching, they found a 25-metre (82 ft) cliff at a rock quarry where they could suspend the balloon vertically before inflation, but that also proved unsuccessful.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair then decided to fill the bag with ambient-temperature air before using the burner to raise the air temperature and provide lift. They constructed a blower with a 14 hp (10 kW) 250 cc (15 cu in) motorcycle engine taken from Wetzel's old MZ, started with a Trabant automobile starter powered by jumper cables from Strelzyk's Moskvitch sedan.[8] This engine, silenced by a Trabant muffler, turned 1-metre-long (3.3 ft) fan blades to inflate the balloon. They also used a home-made flamethrower, similar to the gondola's burner, to pre-heat the air faster. With these modifications in place, they returned to the secluded clearing to try again but still could not inflate the balloon. But using the blower did allow them to discover that the cotton material with which they fashioned the balloon was too porous and leaked excessively.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their unsuccessful effort had cost them 2,400 DDM (US$360). Strelzyk disposed of the cloth by burning it in his furnace over several weeks.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Second test&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Strelzyk and Wetzel purchased samples of different fabrics in local stores, including umbrella material and various samples of taffeta and nylon. They used an oven to test the material for heat resistance. In addition, they created a test rig from a vacuum cleaner and a water-filled glass tube to determine which material would allow the vacuum to exert the most suction on the water, and consequently which was the most impervious to air. The umbrella covering performed the best but was also the most expensive. They instead selected a synthetic kind of taffeta.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To purchase a large quantity of fabric without arousing too much suspicion, the pair again drove to a distant city. This time they travelled over 160 kilometres (100 mi) to a department store in Leipzig. Their new cover story was that they belonged to a sailing club and needed the material to make sails. The quantity they needed had to be ordered, and although they feared the purchase might be reported to East Germany's State Security Service (Stasi), they returned the next day and picked up the material without incident. They paid 4,800 DDM (US$720) for 800 metres (2,600 ft) of 1-metre-wide (3 ft 3 in) fabric.[6] On the way home, they also purchased an electric motor to speed up the pedal-operated sewing machine they had been using to sew the material into the desired balloon shape.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wetzel spent the next week sewing the material into another balloon, accomplishing the task faster the second time with the now-electric sewing machine. Soon afterwards, the two men returned to the forest clearing and inflated the bag in about five minutes using the blower and flame thrower. The bag rose and held air, but the burner on the gondola was not powerful enough to create the heat needed for lift. The pair continued experimenting for months, doubling the number of propane tanks and trying different fuel mixtures. Disappointed with the result, Wetzel decided to abandon the project and instead started to pursue the idea of building a small gasoline engine-powered light aeroplane[6] or a glider.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strelzyk continued trying to improve the burner. In June 1979, he discovered that with the propane tank inverted, additional pressure caused the liquid propane to evaporate, which produced a bigger flame. He modified the gondola to mount the propane tanks upside down, and returned to the test site where he found the new configuration produced a 12-metre (39 ft) long flame. Strelzyk was ready to attempt an escape.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First escape attempt&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;On 3 July 1979, the weather and wind conditions were favourable. The entire Strelzyk family lifted from a forest clearing at 1:30 am and climbed at a rate of 4 metres (13 ft) per second. They reached an altitude of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) according to an altimeter Strelzyk had made by modifying a barometer. A light wind was blowing them towards the border. The balloon then entered clouds, and atmospheric water vapour condensed on the balloon, adding weight which caused it to descend prematurely. The family landed safely approximately 180 metres (590 ft) short of the border, at the edge of the heavily mined border zone. Unsure of where they were, Strelzyk explored until he found a piece of litter – a bread bag from a bakery in Wernigerode, an East German town. The group spent nine hours carefully extricating themselves from the 500-metre (1,600 ft) wide border zone to avoid detection. They also had to travel unnoticed through a 5 km (3.1 mi) restricted zone before hiking back a total of 14 km (8.7 mi) to their car and the launch paraphernalia they had left behind.[6] They made it home just in time to report their absence from work and school due to sickness.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abandoned balloon was discovered by the authorities later that morning. Strelzyk destroyed all compromising evidence and sold his car, fearing that it could link him to the escape attempt.[6] On 14 August, the Stasi launched an appeal to find the "perpetrator of a serious offence", listing in detail all the items recovered at the landing site.[9] Strelzyk felt that the Stasi would eventually trace the balloon to him and the Wetzels. He agreed with Wetzel that their best chance was to quickly build another balloon and get out as soon as possible.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Successful escape&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Strelzyk and Wetzel decided to double the balloon's size to 4,000 cubic metres (140,000 cu ft) in volume, 20 metres (66 ft) in diameter, and 25 metres (82 ft) in height. They needed 1,250 square metres (13,500 sq ft) of taffeta, and purchased the material, in various colours and patterns, all over the country in order to escape suspicion. Wetzel sewed a third balloon, using over 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) of thread, and Strelzyk rebuilt everything else as before. In six weeks, they had prepared the 180-kilogram (400 lb) balloon and a payload of 550 kilograms (1,210 lb), including the gondola, equipment, and cargo (the two families). Confident in their calculations, they found the weather conditions right on 15 September, when a violent thunderstorm created the correct winds. The two families set off for the launch site in Strelzyk's replacement car (a Wartburg) and a moped. Arriving at 1:30 am, they needed just ten minutes to inflate the balloon and an additional three minutes to heat the air.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifting off just after 2:00 am, the group failed to cut the tethers holding the gondola to the ground at the same time, tilting the balloon and sending the flame towards the fabric, which caught fire. After putting out the fire with an extinguisher brought along for just such an emergency, they climbed to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) in nine minutes, drifting towards West Germany at 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph). The balloon flew for 28 minutes, with the temperature plummeting to −8 °C (18 °F) in the unsheltered gondola, which consisted solely of clothesline railing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A design miscalculation resulted in the burner stovepipe being too long, causing the flame to be too high in the balloon, creating excessive pressure which caused the balloon to split. The air rushing out of the split extinguished the burner flame. Wetzel was able to re-light the flame with a match, and had to do so several more times before the group landed. At one point, they increased the flame to the maximum possible extent and rose to 2,500 metres (8,200 ft). They later learned they had been high enough to be detected, but not identified, on radar by West German air traffic controllers.[6] They had also been detected on the East German side by a night watchman at the district culture house in Bad Lobenstein. The report of an unidentified flying object heading toward the border caused guards to activate search lights, but the balloon was too high and out of reach of the lights.[10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tear in the balloon meant the group had to use the burner much more often, greatly limiting the distance it could travel. Wetzel later said he thought they could have travelled another 50 kilometres (31 mi) had the balloon remained intact. They made out the border crossing at Rudolphstein on the A9 and saw the search lights. When the propane ran out, they descended quickly, landing near the town of Naila, in the West German state of Bavaria and only 10 km (6 mi) from the border. The only injury was suffered by Wetzel, who broke his leg upon landing.[6] Various clues indicated to the families that the balloon had made it across the border. These included spotting red and yellow coloured lights, not common in East Germany,[3] and small farms, in contrast to the large state-run operations in the east. Another clue was modern farm equipment, unlike the older equipment used in East Germany.[11] Two Bavarian State Police officers saw the balloon's flickering light and headed to where they thought it would land. There they found Strelzyk and Wetzel, who first asked if they had made it to the West, although they noticed the police car was an Audi – another sign they were in West Germany. Upon learning they had, the escapees happily called for their families to join them.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Aftermath&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;East Germany immediately increased border security, closed all small airports close to the border, and ordered the planes kept farther inland.[6] Propane gas tanks became registered products, and large quantities of fabric suitable for balloon construction could no longer be purchased. Mail from East Germany to the two escaped families was prohibited.[12]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erich Strelzyk learned of his brother's escape on the ZDF news and was arrested in his Potsdam apartment three hours after the landing. The arrest of family members was standard procedure to deter others from attempting escape. He was charged with "aiding and abetting escape", as were Strelzyk's sister Maria and her husband, who were sentenced to 2½ years. The three were eventually released with the help of Amnesty International.[12]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The families decided to initially settle in Naila where they had landed. Wetzel worked as an automobile mechanic and Strelzyk opened a TV repair shop in Bad Kissingen. Due to pressure from Stasi spies, the Strelzyks moved to Switzerland in 1985.[10] After German reunification in 1990, they returned to their old home in their hometown of Pößneck.[13] The Wetzels remained in Bavaria.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West German weekly magazine Stern paid Strelzyk and Wetzel for exclusive rights to the story.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The escape has been portrayed in two films: Night Crossing (1982) and Balloon (2018). The former, also called With the Wind to the West – the English translation of the German title – was an English-language film produced by Disney. The latter was a German-language production which "both families welcomed [Director] Herbig’s desire to, as he put it, 'make a German film for an international audience.'" The Strelzyks were reportedly "moved to tears" at the screening of Balloon at Rockefeller Center in New York City.[12] Herbig claimed in 2018 that both the Strelzyk and Wetzel families had been dissatisfied with the Disney film.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Strelzyk died in 2017 at age 74 after a long illness.[13]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the balloon was put on permanent display at the Haus der Bayerischen Geschichte: Museum in Regensburg.[10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Escapees&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The family members included:[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Peter Strelzyk, aged 37&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Doris Strelzyk&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Frank Strelzyk, aged 15&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Andreas Strelzyk, aged 11&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Günter Wetzel, aged 24&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Petra Wetzel&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Peter Wetzel, aged 5&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Andreas Wetzel, aged 2&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Media&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Disney film Night Crossing (1982) is an adaptation of the story[13]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Michael Herbig's film Balloon (2018) is a German-language adaptation of the story[15]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;BBC program Outlook, "Fleeing Communism in a Hot Air Balloon"[16]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;PBS Nova program, "History's Great Escapes" (2004)[17]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Doris Strelzyk, Peter Strelzyk, Gudrun Giese: Destiny Balloon Escape.

    &lt;p&gt;i was at bombay airport. some dude was watching reels on full volume and laughing loudly. asking nicely doesn't work anymore. me being me, didn't have the courage to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;so i built a tiny app that plays back the same audio it hears, delayed by ~2 seconds. asked claude, it spat out a working version in one prompt. surprisingly WORKS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;discussion - https://x.com/the2ndfloorguy/status/2011734249871954188&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;something something auditory feedback loop something something cognitive dissonance. idk i'm not a neuroscientist. all i know is it makes people shut up and that's good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;straight up honest - originally called this "make-it-stop" but then saw @TimDarcet also built similar and named it STFU. wayyyyy better name. so stole it. sorry not sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;made with spite and web audio api. do whatever you want with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;yo, meanwhile if you are new here, you might find my, other side projects kinda funny.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Reading across books with Claude Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jan 4, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are overused to summarise and underused to help us read deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explore how they can enrich rather than reduce, I set Claude Code up with tools to mine a library of 100 non-fiction books. It found sequences of excerpts connected by an interesting idea, or trails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a part of one such trail, linking deception in the startup world to the social psychology of mass movements (I’m especially pleased by the jump from Jobs to Theranos):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The books were selected from Hacker News’ favourites, which I previously scraped and visualized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude browses the books a chunk at a time. A chunk is a segment of roughly 500 words that aligns with paragraphs when possible. This length is a good balance between saving tokens and providing enough context for ideas to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chunks are indexed by topic, and topics are themselves indexed for search. This makes it easy to look up all passages in the corpus that relate to, say, deception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works well when you know what to look for, but search alone can’t tell you which topics are present to begin with. There are over 100,000 extracted topics, far too many to be browsed directly. To support exploration, they are grouped into a hierarchical tree structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This yields around 1,000 top-level topics. They emerge from combining lower-level topics, and not all of them are equally useful:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Incidents that frustrated Ev Williams&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Names beginning with “Da”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Events between 1971 &amp;amp; 1974&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this Borgesian taxonomy is good enough for Claude to piece together what the books are about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude uses the topic tree and the search via a few CLI tools.&lt;lb/&gt; They allow it to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find all chunks associated with a topic similar to a query.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find topics which occur in a window of chunks around a given topic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find topics that co-occur in multiple books.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browse topics and chunks that are siblings in the topic tree.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To generate the trails, the agent works in stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First, it scans the library and the existing trails, and proposes novel trail ideas. It mainly browses the topic tree to find unexplored areas and rarely reads full chunks in depth.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then, it takes a specific idea and turns it into a trail. It receives seed topics from the previous stage and browses many chunks. It extracts excerpts, specific sequences of sentences, and decides on how best to order them to support an insight.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, it adds highlights and edges between consecutive excerpts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I learned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Claude Code is great for non-coding tasks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though I’ve been using Claude Code to develop for months, my first instinct for this project was to consider it as a traditional pipeline of several discrete stages. My initial attempt at this system consisted of multiple LLM modules with carefully hand-assembled contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a whim, I ran Claude with access to the debugging tools I’d been using and a minimal prompt: “find something interesting.” It immediately did a better job at pulling in what it needed than the pipeline I was trying to tune by hand, while requiring much less orchestration. It was a clear improvement to push as much of the work into the agent’s loop as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up using Claude as my main interface to the project.&lt;lb/&gt; Initially I did so because it inferred the sequence of CLI calls I wanted to run faster than I could recall them. Then, I used it to automate tasks which weren’t rigid enough to be scripted traditionally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latter opened up options that I wouldn’t have considered before. For example, I changed my mind on how short I wanted excerpts to be. I communicated my new preference to Claude, which then looked through all the existing trails and edited them as necessary, balancing the way the overall meaning of the trail changed. Previously, I would’ve likely considered all previous trails to be outdated and generated new ones, because the required edits would’ve been too nuanced to specify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, agents have widened my ambitions.&lt;lb/&gt; By taking care of the boilerplate, I no longer shy away from the tedious parts. Revision is cheap, so I don’t need to plow ahead with suboptimal choices just because it’d be too costly to undo them. This, in turn, keeps up the momentum and lets me focus on the joyful, creative aspects of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ask the agent what it needs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My focus went from optimising prompts to implementing better tools for Claude to use, moving up a rung on the abstraction ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mental model of the AI component changed: from a function mapping input to output, to a coworker I was assisting. I spent my time thinking about the affordances that would make the workflow better, as if I were designing them for myself. That they were to be used by an agent was a mere detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This worked because the agent is now intelligent enough that the way it uses these tools overlaps with my own mental model. It is generally easy to empathise with it and predict what it will do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially I watched Claude’s logs closely and tried to guess where it was lacking a certain ability. Then I realised I could simply ask it to provide feedback at the end and list the functionality it wished it had. Claude was excellent at proposing new commands and capabilities that would make the work more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude suggested improvements, which Claude implemented, so Claude could do the work better. At least I’m still needed to pay for the tokens — for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Novelty is a useful guide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to quantify interestingness as an objective to optimise for.&lt;lb/&gt; Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned makes the case that chasing novelty is often a more fruitful approach. While its conclusions are debated, I’ve found this idea to be a good fit for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a sign of the times, this novelty search was implemented in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By biasing the search algorithm towards under-explored topics and books.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By asking Claude nicely.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A topic’s novelty score was calculated as the mean distance from its embedding’s k nearest neighbors. A book’s novelty score is the average novelty of the unique topics that it contains. This value was used to rank search results, so that those which were both relevant and novel were more likely to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a prompting level, Claude starts the ideation phase by looking at all the existing trails and is asked to avoid any conceptual overlap. This works fairly well, though it is often distracted by any topics related to secrecy, systems theory, or tacit knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s as if the very act of finding connections in a corpus summons the spirit of Umberto Eco and amps up the conspiratorial thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it’s implemented&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EPUBs are parsed using &lt;code&gt;selectolax&lt;/code&gt;, which I picked over BeautifulSoup for its speed and simpler API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Everything from the plain text to the topic tree is stored in SQLite. Embeddings are stored using &lt;code&gt;sqlite-vec&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The text is split into sentences using &lt;code&gt;wtpsplit&lt;/code&gt;(the&lt;code&gt;sat-6l-sm&lt;/code&gt;model). Those sentences are then grouped into chunks, trying to get up to 500 words without breaking up paragraphs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;DSPy&lt;/code&gt;to call LLMs. It worked well for the structured data extraction and it was easy to switch out different models to experiment. I tried its prompt optimizers before I went full agentic, and their results were very promising.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I settled on Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite for topic extraction. The model gets passed a chunk and is asked to return 3-5 topics. It is also asked whether the chunk is useful, in order to filter out index entries, acknowledgements, orphan headers, etc. I was surprised at how stable these extracted topics were: similar chunks often shared some of the exact same topic labels. Processing 100 books used about 60M input tokens and ~£10 in total.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After a couple books got indexed, I shared the results with Claude Opus along with the original prompt and asked it to improve it. This is a half-baked single iteration of the type of prompt optimisation DSPy implements, and it worked rather well.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Topic pairs with a distance below a threshold get merged together. This takes care of near-duplicates such as “Startup founder”, “Startup founders”, and “Founder of startups”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CLI output uses a semi-XML format. In order to stimulate navigating, most output is nested with related content. For example, when searching for a topic, chunks are shown with the other topics they contain. This allows us to get a sense of what the chunk is about, as well as which other topics might be interesting. There’s probably more token-efficient formats, but I never hit the limit of the context window.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &amp;lt;topic id="59349" label="Theranos"/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/chunk&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/topic&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/topics&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topics are embedded using&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;google/embeddinggemma-300m&lt;/code&gt;and reranked using&lt;code&gt;BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many CLI tools require loading the embedding model and other expensive state. The first call transparently starts a separate server process which loads all these resources once and holds onto them for a while. Subsequent CLI calls use this server through Python’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;multiprocessing.connection&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The topic collection is turned into a graph (backed by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;igraph&lt;/code&gt;) by adding edges based on the similarity of their embeddings and the point-wise mutual information of their co-occurrences.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The graph is turned into a tree by applying Leiden partitioning recursively until a minimum size is reached. I tried the Surprise quality function because it had no parameters to tweak, and found it to be good enough. Each group is labelled by Gemini based on all the topics that it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Excerpts are cleaned by Gemini to remove EPUB artifacts, parsing errors, headers, footnotes, etc. Doing this only for excerpts that are actually shown, instead of during pre-processing, saved a lot of tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Closing the Door on Net-NTLMv1: Releasing Rainbow Tables to Accelerate Protocol Deprecation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Mandiant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written by: Nic Losby&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mandiant is publicly releasing a comprehensive dataset of Net-NTLMv1 rainbow tables to underscore the urgency of migrating away from this outdated protocol. Despite Net-NTLMv1 being deprecated and known to be insecure for over two decades—with cryptanalysis dating back to 1999—Mandiant consultants continue to identify its use in active environments. This legacy protocol leaves organizations vulnerable to trivial credential theft, yet it remains prevalent due to inertia and a lack of demonstrated immediate risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By releasing these tables, Mandiant aims to lower the barrier for security professionals to demonstrate the insecurity of Net-NTLMv1. While tools to exploit this protocol have existed for years, they often required uploading sensitive data to third-party services or expensive hardware to brute-force keys. The release of this dataset allows defenders and researchers to recover keys in under 12 hours using consumer hardware costing less than $600 USD. This initiative highlights the amplified impact of combining Mandiant's frontline expertise with Google Cloud's resources to eliminate entire classes of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post details the generation of the tables, provides access to the dataset for community use, and outlines critical remediation steps to disable Net-NTLMv1 and prevent authentication coercion attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Net-NTLMv1 has been widely known to be insecure since at least 2012, following presentations at DEFCON 20, with cryptanalysis of the underlying protocol dating back to at least 1999. On Aug. 30, 2016, Hashcat added support for cracking Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys using known plaintext, further democratizing the ability to attack this protocol. Rainbow tables are almost as old, with the initial paper on rainbow tables published in 2003 by Philippe Oechslin, citing an earlier iteration of a time-memory trade-off from 1980 by Martin Hellman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essentially, if an attacker can obtain a Net-NTLMv1 hash without Extended Session Security (ESS) for the known plaintext of &lt;code&gt;1122334455667788&lt;/code&gt;, a cryptographic attack, referred to as a known plaintext attack (KPA), can be applied. This guarantees recovery of the key material used. Since the key material is the password hash of the authenticating Active Directory (AD) object—user or computer—the attack results can quickly be used to compromise the object, often leading to privilege escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common chain attackers use is authentication coercion from a highly privileged object, such as a domain controller (DC). Recovering the password hash of the DC machine account allows for DCSync privileges to compromise any other account in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Dataset Release&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The unsorted dataset can be downloaded using &lt;code&gt;gsutil -m cp -r gs://net-ntlmv1-tables/tables .&lt;/code&gt; or through the Google Cloud Research Dataset portal. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SHA512 hashes of the tables can be checked by first downloading the checksums &lt;code&gt;gsutil -m cp gs://net-ntlmv1-tables/tables.sha512 .&lt;/code&gt; then checked by &lt;code&gt;sha512sum -c tables.sha512&lt;/code&gt;. The password cracking community has already created derivative work and is also hosting the ready to use tables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Use of the Tables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a Net-NTLMv1 hash has been obtained, the tables can be used with historical or modern reinventions of rainbow table searching software such as rainbowcrack (rcrack), or RainbowCrack-NG on central processing units (CPUs) or a fork of rainbowcrackalack on graphics processing units (GPUs). The Net-NTLMv1 hash needs to be preprocessed to the DES components using ntlmv1-multi as shown in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Obtaining a Net-NTLMv1 Hash&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most attackers will use Responder with the &lt;code&gt;--lm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--disable-ess&lt;/code&gt; flags and set the authentication to a static value of &lt;code&gt;1122334455667788&lt;/code&gt; to only allow for connections with Net-NTLMv1 as a possibility. Attackers can then wait for incoming connections or coerce authentication using a tool such as PetitPotam or DFSCoerce to generate incoming connections from DCs or lower privilege hosts that are useful for objective completion. Responses can be cracked to retrieve password hashes of either users or computer machine accounts. A sample workflow for an attacker is shown below in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 1: DFSCoerce against a DC&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 2: Net-NTLMv1 hash obtained for DC machine account&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 3: Parse Net-NTLMv1 hash to DES parts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 4 illustrates the processing of the Net-NTLMv1 hash to the DES ciphertexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 4: Net-NTLMv1 hash to DES ciphertexts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An attacker then takes the split-out ciphertexts to crack the keys used based on the known plaintext of &lt;code&gt;1122334455667788&lt;/code&gt; with the steps of loading the tables shown in Figure 5 and cracking results in Figure 6 and Figure 7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 5: Loading DES components for cracking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 6: First hash cracked&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 7: Second hash cracked and run statistics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An attacker can then calculate the last remaining key with ntlmv1-multi once again, or look it up with twobytes, to recreate the full NT hash for the DC account with the last key part shown in Figure 8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 8: Calculate remaining key&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result can be checked with hashcat's NT hash shucking mode, &lt;code&gt;-m 27000&lt;/code&gt;, as shown in Figure 9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 9: Keys checked with hash shucking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An attacker can then use the hash to perform a DCSync attack targeting a DC and authenticating as the now compromised machine account. The attack flow uses secretsdump.py from the Impacket toolsuite and is shown in Figure 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 10: DCSync attack performed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Remediation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations should immediately disable the use of Net-NTLMv1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Local Computer Policy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Local Security Settings" &amp;gt; "Local Policies" &amp;gt; "Security Options" &amp;gt; “Network security: LAN Manager authentication level" &amp;gt; "Send NTLMv2 response only".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Group Policy&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As these are local to the computer configurations, attackers can and have set the configuration to a vulnerable state to then fix the configuration after their attacks have completed with local administrative access. Monitoring and alerting of when and where Net-NTLMv1 is used is needed in addition to catching these edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filter Event Logs for Event ID 4624: "An Account was successfully logged on." &amp;gt; "Detailed Authentication Information" &amp;gt; "Authentication Package" &amp;gt; "Package Name (NTLM only)", if "LM" or "NTLMv1" is the value of this attribute, LAN Manager or Net-NTLMv1 was used.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;install.md: A Standard for LLM-Executable Installation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 15, 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Ryaboy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content Strategist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Share this article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing software is the kind of specific and repetitive task that agents are good at. Today we are proposing install.md to standardize how developers should write installation instructions for agents. It's currently live on all Mintlify sites including Cerebras, Firecrawl, and Langchain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proposal for a standard &lt;code&gt;/install.md&lt;/code&gt; file that provides LLM-executable installation instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents are growing in capability faster than software developers have been able to keep up. Product documentation today is focused on humans instead of AI which creates friction when trying to automate annoying yak-shaving style tasks like installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference is very subtle. Agents need to have a task iterated to them like "I want you to install Mintlify CLI for me. Execute all the steps below autonomously." whereas humans can work from more general prose or even a bash script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we are proposing install.md to standardize how developers should write installation instructions for agents. It's currently live on all Mintlify sites including Cerebras, Firecrawl, and Langchain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Proposal&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add an &lt;code&gt;install.md&lt;/code&gt; markdown file to your project with LLM-executable installation instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users paste that file into an LLM or pipe it directly from a URL. The LLM reads the instructions, detects the environment, adapts to the setup, and executes—optionally with approval at every step. Because the file is human-readable, users see exactly what will happen before it runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of piping an executable file into bash with absolutely zero safeguards on what gets executed or confidence that it will figure out how to work with your arch linux setup, you can instead send an install.md to claude and trust Opus to deal with the minutia for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -fsSL https://www.anaconda.com/docs/install.md | claude
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This works for any language or framework, whether your software is distributed as a binary, package, or script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the developer, you define how installation should work. You encode knowledge about edge cases that would clutter your docs but matter when things break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mintlify now auto detects all of that information, synthesizes it into a version designed for agents, and hosts it for you at &lt;code&gt;https://&amp;lt;your-docs-url&amp;gt;/install.md&lt;/code&gt;. If your documentation covers multiple products—say, an SDK and a CLI—Mintlify defaults to generating install.md for the CLI. You can override the auto-generated file by adding your own &lt;code&gt;install.md&lt;/code&gt; to the root of your documentation directory. If you'd prefer to disable the feature entirely, reach out to support@mintlify.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you are not using Mintlify, you can set up and host this file manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Format&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;install.md uses a structured format with specific keywords that guide the LLM through autonomous execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical install.md includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Header: Product name as a lowercase, hyphenated H1 heading (e.g., &lt;code&gt;# claude-code&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Description: Blockquote describing the product (e.g., &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; Documentation and setup instructions for product-name&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Action prompt: Direct instruction to the LLM (e.g., "I want you to install [Product] for me. Execute all the steps below autonomously.")&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;OBJECTIVE: What the installation should achieve&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;DONE WHEN: Specific verification criteria (e.g., a command that returns expected output)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;TODO: Markdown checkbox list of steps to complete&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Step sections: Detailed installation instructions with code blocks&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;EXECUTE NOW: Call-to-action that references the TODO list and objective&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This format is flexible—it's up to the developer to define the steps necessary for a successful installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# mintlify

&amp;gt; Documentation and setup instructions for mintlify

I want you to install Mintlify CLI for me. Execute all the steps below autonomously.

OBJECTIVE: Install the Mintlify CLI and set up a local documentation preview environment.

DONE WHEN: Local documentation server is running and accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## TODO

- [ ] Verify Node.js v20.17.0+ is installed
- [ ] Install the Mintlify CLI globally
- [ ] Create a new documentation project
- [ ] Start the local development server
- [ ] Verify the preview is accessible at localhost:3000

## Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js v20.17.0 or higher installed. Verify your Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
```

You must also have Git installed:

```bash
git --version
```

## Install the CLI

You need to install the Mintlify CLI globally using npm or pnpm.

Using npm:

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

Using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -g mint
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
mint --version
```

## Create a new documentation project

You must create a new documentation project using the CLI. This clones the starter kit into your specified directory:

```bash
mint new docs
```

The CLI will prompt you for a project name and theme. You can also specify these directly:

```bash
mint new docs --name my-project --theme linden
```

Navigate into your new project directory:

```bash
cd docs
```

## Start the local preview server

You need to start the development server to preview your documentation locally:

```bash
mint dev
```

Your documentation preview is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

If port 3000 is already in use, you can specify a custom port:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

Alternatively, run without global installation using npx:

```bash
npx mint dev
```

## Verify the preview

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to confirm the documentation site is running.

## Update the CLI

If you need to update to the latest version:

```bash
mint update
```

Or reinstall with the latest version:

```bash
npm i -g mint@latest
```

## Additional CLI commands

Check for broken links in your documentation:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

Check for accessibility issues:

```bash
mint a11y
```

Validate an OpenAPI specification:

```bash
mint openapi-check &amp;lt;openapi-file-or-url&amp;gt;
```

EXECUTE NOW: Complete the above TODO list to achieve: Local documentation server is running and accessible at http://localhost:3000.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The instructions describe outcomes, not exact commands. The LLM adapts to the environment—npm or pnpm, macOS or Linux, fresh project or existing codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Relationship to llms.txt&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;install.md works naturally with your llms.txt. llms.txt helps LLMs understand your software; install.md tells them how to install it. Your install.md can link to your llms.txt so the LLM can reference it for troubleshooting, configuration details, or any additional context needed during installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Advantages&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers shipping software:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define installation once and it adapts to every environment. You can encode edge cases and troubleshooting knowledge without cluttering your main documentation. There's no wizard to build or maintain, and you control exactly what context the LLM receives. Installation instructions for agents can differ from your public docs without worrying about company voice or developer experience polish. You're writing directly to your actual users, which are agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For users installing software:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single command installs your software, or you can paste the file into any LLM. The instructions are human-readable so you can review every step before it executes, and modify it to improve performance on your system if necessary. The LLM adapts to your specific environment automatically. Because the file is fetched at runtime, you never deal with stale training data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For agents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installation instructions live in a predictable location that's easy to find. The structured format provides clear success criteria for determining when installation is complete. The file is markdown, not HTML, which means clean input for the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contributing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spec is open source:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Spec: installmd.org&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;GitHub: github.com/mintlify/install-md&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add an &lt;code&gt;install.md&lt;/code&gt; to your project root or &lt;code&gt;/docs&lt;/code&gt; directory. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use Mintlify for documentation, install.md is generated automatically at &lt;code&gt;yourdocs.com/install.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about installation wizards like PostHog's or Sentry's?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wizards solve the same problem: reliable installation across environments. They require significant engineering to build and maintain. PostHog's wizard consists of several LLM prompts, which users need to audit the repo to find. install.md is a lighter-weight alternative—define instructions in markdown, and the LLM handles adaptation. For complex integrations with many configuration options, a dedicated wizard may still be the right choice. For most software, install.md gets you most of the benefit with far less effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does install.md work with my existing CLI or scripts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your install.md can instruct the LLM to run your CLI, execute your scripts, or follow your existing setup process. Think of it as a layer that guides the LLM to use whatever tools you've already built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about security? Isn't this just &lt;code&gt;curl | bash&lt;/code&gt; with extra steps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fair concern. A few things make install.md different:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Human-readable by design. Users can review the instructions before execution. Unlike obfuscated scripts, the intent is clear.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Step-by-step approval. LLMs in agentic contexts can be configured to request approval before running commands. Users see each action and can reject it.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;No hidden behavior. install.md describes outcomes in natural language. Malicious intent is harder to hide than in a shell script.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install.md doesn't eliminate trust requirements. Users should only use install.md files from sources they trust—same as any installation method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about versioning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;install.md works at the current version by default. If your installation differs significantly across versions, you can host version-specific files (&lt;code&gt;/v2/install.md&lt;/code&gt;) or include version detection logic in the instructions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if install.md doesn't fit my use case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spec is open source. Open an issue or submit a PR—we're evolving the standard based on real-world feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;More blog posts to read&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why documentation is one of the most important surfaces for marketers&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A look at why documentation is one of the most influential surfaces in a technical product’s funnel, how it shapes evaluation and adoption, and why marketers should treat it as a core part of their narrative.&lt;/p&gt;January 14, 2026&lt;p&gt;Peri Langlois&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head of Product Marketing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How I built our knowledge base in an afternoon&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migrating content from multiple sources to Mintlify and building a knowledge base in hours, not weeks.&lt;/p&gt;January 13, 2026&lt;p&gt;Anahita Sahu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief of Staff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Ryaboy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content Strategist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FLUX.2 [klein]: Towards Interactive Visual Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Models&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FLUX.2 [klein]: Towards Interactive Visual Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we release the FLUX.2 [klein] model family, our fastest image models to date. FLUX.2 [klein] unifies generation and editing in a single compact architecture, delivering state-of-the-art quality with end-to-end inference as low as under a second. Built for applications that require real-time image generation without sacrificing quality, and runs on consumer hardware with as little as 13GB VRAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Demo showing editing with FLUX.2 [klein]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why go [klein]?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visual Intelligence is entering a new era. As AI agents become more capable, they need visual generation that can keep up; models that respond in real-time, iterate quickly, and run efficiently on accessible hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The klein name comes from the German word for "small", reflecting both the compact model size and the minimal latency. But FLUX.2 [klein] is anything but limited. These models deliver exceptional performance in text-to-image generation, image editing and multi-reference generation, typically reserved for much larger models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What's New&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sub-second inference. Generate or edit images in under 0.5s on modern hardware.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Photorealistic outputs and high diversity, especially in the base variants.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unified generation and editing. Text-to-image, image editing, and multi-reference support in a single model while delivering frontier performance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Runs on consumer GPUs. The 4B model fits in ~13GB VRAM (RTX 3090/4070 and above).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Developer-friendly &amp;amp; Accessible: Apache 2.0 on 4B models, open weights for 9B models. Full open weights for customization and fine-tuning.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;API and open weights. Production-ready API or run locally with full weights.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The “FLUX [dev] Non-Commercial License” has been renamed to “FLUX Non-Commercial License” and will apply to the 9B Klein models. No material changes have been made to the license.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;FLUX.2 [klein] 9B&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our flagship small model. Defines the Pareto frontier for quality vs. latency across text-to-image, single-reference editing, and multi-reference generation. Matches or exceeds models 5x its size - in under half a second. Built on a 9B flow model with 8B Qwen3 text embedder, step-distilled to 4 inference steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combine multiple input images, blend concepts, and iterate on complex compositions - all at sub-second speed with frontier-level quality. No model this fast has ever done this well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;License: FLUX NCL&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;FLUX.2 [klein] 4B:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fully open under Apache 2.0. Our most accessible model, it runs on consumer GPUs like the RTX 3090/4070. Compact but capable: supports T2I, I2I, and multi-reference at quality that punches above its size. Built for local development and edge deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The full-capacity foundation models. Undistilled, preserving complete training signal for maximum flexibility. Ideal for fine-tuning, LoRA training, research, and custom pipelines where control matters more than speed. Higher output diversity than the distilled models.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are also releasing FP8 and NVFP4 versions of all [klein] variants, developed in collaboration with NVIDIA for optimized inference on RTX GPUs. Same capabilities, smaller footprint - compatible with even more hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FP8: Up to 1.6x faster, up to 40% less VRAM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NVFP4: Up to 2.7x faster, up to 55% less VRAM&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 [klein] Elo vs Latency (top) and VRAM (bottom) across Text-to-Image, Image-to-Image Single Reference, and Multi-Reference tasks. FLUX.2 [klein] matches or exceeds Qwen's quality at a fraction of the latency and VRAM, and outperforms Z-Image while supporting both text-to-image generation and (multi-reference) image editing in a unified model. The base variants trade some speed for full customizability and fine-tuning, making them better suited for research and adaptation to specific use cases. Speed is measured on a GB200 in bf16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Into the New&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 [klein] is more than a faster model. It's a step toward our vision of interactive visual intelligence. We believe the future belongs to creators and developers with AI that can see, create, and iterate in real-time. Systems that enable new categories of applications: real-time design tools, agentic visual reasoning, interactive content creation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;keifu (系譜, /keːɸɯ/) is a terminal UI tool that visualizes Git commit graphs. It shows a colored commit graph, commit details, and a summary of changed files, and lets you perform basic branch operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Readable commit graph — &lt;code&gt;git log --graph&lt;/code&gt;is hard to read; keifu renders a cleaner, color-coded graph&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fast branch switching — With AI-assisted coding, working on multiple branches in parallel has become common. keifu makes branch switching quick and visual&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep it simple — Only basic Git operations are supported; this is not a full-featured Git client&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Narrow terminal friendly — Works well in split panes and small windows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No image protocol required — Works on any terminal with Unicode support&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unicode commit graph with per-branch colors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commit list with branch labels, date, author, short hash, and message (some fields may be hidden on narrow terminals)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commit detail panel with full message and changed file stats (+/-)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Git operations: checkout, create/delete branch, fetch&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Branch search with dropdown UI&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run inside a Git repository (auto-discovery from current directory)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A terminal with Unicode line drawing support and color&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;command in PATH (required for fetch)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust toolchain (for building from source)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cargo install keifu&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mise use -g github:trasta298/keifu@latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/trasta298/keifu &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd keifu &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cargo install --path .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run inside a Git repository:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;keifu&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See docs/configuration.md for configuration options.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Refresh repository data&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Toggle help&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;Esc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Quit&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The TUI loads up to 500 commits across all branches.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Merge commits are diffed against the first parent; the initial commit is diffed against an empty tree.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Changed files are capped at 50 and binary files are skipped.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If there are staged or unstaged changes (excluding untracked files), an "uncommitted changes" row appears at the top.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When multiple branches point to the same commit, the label is collapsed to a single name with a &lt;code&gt;+N&lt;/code&gt;suffix (e.g.,&lt;code&gt;main +2&lt;/code&gt;). Use&lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;←&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;→&lt;/code&gt;to switch between them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Checking out &lt;code&gt;origin/xxx&lt;/code&gt;creates or updates a local branch. Upstream is set only when creating a new branch. If the local branch exists but points to a different commit, it is force-updated to match the remote.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remote branches are displayed, but delete operations only work with local branches.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fetch requires the &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt;remote to be configured.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~48 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Drone Hacking Part 1: Dumping Firmware and Bruteforcing ECC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Intro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In July 2025, we from Neodyme got together in Munich and did security research on a bunch of IoT devices, ranging from bluetooth headsets, to door locks, to drones. One of these was the Potensic Atom 2. It’s a photo and video drone with a gimbal-stabilized 4K camera and a remote control that you hook up to your own smartphone and the proprietary app. If you’ve ever flown a DJI Mini 4K, this drone will look very familiar to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is part of a two-part series that will cover how we disassembled the drone and dumped the firmware from the NAND chip and how we analyzed the drone’s firmware, app, and remote control to find some backdoors and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Goal: Dumping the Firmware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most important pieces of information you can acquire when setting up to hack a device is its firmware. If you want to reverse engineer the software that’s running on the drone and find vulnerabilities in that, then you need a copy of it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there are a couple of ways to go about that, some are less intrusive and some are more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might get lucky and be able to just download the firmware as a firmware update from the manufacturer’s website. However, those update sites are often not publicly documented and can be locked behind authorization checks or encrypted. Encrypted firmwares can still be useful - you “just” need to reverse engineer the on-device decryption process. For the Atom 2, downloading the firmware updates required having a valid drone and remote control serial number and the firmware update was also encrypted. Without having the decryption logic, we put this approach on ice during our initial research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another really comfortable approach is to use exposed debug interfaces like JTAG or UART. However, those are often undocumented, unlabeled, or entirely removed for public versions. We didn’t find any on the Atom 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we can always do, though not necessarily always successful, is solder off the entire NAND chip and dump the firmware byte by byte. This has the risk of breaking the NAND chip and/or the rest of the board if you’re not careful. Also, some devices, like modern smart phones, encrypt their persistent storage with key material stored in, e.g., the TPM. If that is the case, then simply soldering off the NAND chip will leave you with unusable encrypted data. Fortunately, the Atom 2’s NAND contents are not encrypted, as we find out later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dumping the NAND Chip&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dumping a NAND chip generally always follows the same pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying the NAND Chip&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Removing it from the board&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying the data pins and communication protocol of the NAND chip&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connecting the NAND chip to some kind of reading device&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading the NAND content&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reassembling the read contents into a working firmware - usually containing one or more file systems&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Identifying the NAND Chip&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Atom 2 has multiple boards:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are mainly interested in the main board because that’s where the NAND flash is going to be. The main board had several metal RF shields that we have already pried off or cut through on the photos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can identify most of these chips through their markings. Note that while we’re mainly interested in the NAND chip, knowing the others can help with recognizing things during reversing later on. Roughly knowing which SoC we were working with was crucial, as you will see in later sections of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Note that the markings below might not match the photos completely. We had multiple drones. The markings are mostly from the first drone and the photos are mostly of the second drone.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Top-side&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SoC (System on a Chip, aka “the main thingy”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Markings: 23AP10 VTQMSQKJYJ 4978-CN B3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We didn’t find an exact match, but this site references the 21AP10. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The page title is &lt;code&gt;21AP10 SS928 平替SD3403V100 海思 SOC芯片&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;21AP10 SS928 平替&lt;/code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;code&gt;21AP10 SS928 Drop-In Replacement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SD3403V100 海思 SOC芯片&lt;/code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;code&gt;HiSilicon SD3403V100 SOC Chip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;That is a mobile camera SoC.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The page title is &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It makes sense that this is the SoC because it is close to both external RAM chips and the NAND flash.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In this teardown of a previous Atom model, the device had a &lt;code&gt;HiSilicon Hi 3559 camera MCU&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We found a data sheet for the HiSilicon Hi3519 V100. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Close enough for now.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Removing the NAND Chip from the board&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have identified the NAND chip, we fasten the board and tape off the remaining components with heat-shielding tape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually getting the chip off of the board is just a matter of using hot air station and flux. However, you can see on the photos that the chip is actually glued to the main board with what is probably epoxy. That’s a thing you can do if you want to secure the chips more securely and not depend on the solder joints to hold your chip in place (and risk breaking them). Or you can do that just to the NAND chip to make it harder for researcher to pry off your NAND chip and dump your firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, a few cuts with a sharp knife, some heat and a generous amount of flux later, the little bugger came off in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(And with it, a couple of extremely tiny resistors that I knocked off with my pliers and promptly lost. This main board is now broken. But don’t worry, through the magic of buying &lt;del&gt;two&lt;/del&gt; three of them, we can still fly the drone.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Identifying the data pins and communication protocol of the NAND chip&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the data sheet of the MX35UF4GE4AD NAND chip, the flash chip can either come in a 24-pin BGA package or an 8-pin WSON package, which we have here. A quick look at the pin descriptions tell us that the NAND chip is communicating via SPI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;DNU&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Do Not Use&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, let’s solder tiny copper cables to all of those pins and drown them in a bit of hot glue to stop them from breaking off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that you can get a proper socket for 8-WSON chips into which you simply clamp the chip and which exposes easy-to-work-with breakout pins. None of our sockets we brought fit though, so we just did it the old-school way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Connecting the NAND chip to some kind of reading device&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SPI is pretty easy to work with. We have two main data lines called SI and SO (Serial In/Out). You will also find them under the names “MOSI” and “MISO” (Master Out Slave In / Master In Slave Out). As the names of these suggest, SPI follows a master-slave architecture. The microcontroller drives the communication and the peripheral device reacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we are simulating the microcontroller-side of the communication, which means that we have a large amount of control. Specifically, we control the clock (SCLK). Sometimes it is hard to talk to embedded hardware because of the speed at which they operate. With SPI, however, we can slow down the clock to however fast we want the devices to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since SPI is a bus protocol, more than one slave device can be hooked up to a master device on the same data lines. To avoid collisions, each device is also assigned its own “Chip Select” line (CS). When the master device wants to talk to a specific slave device, it pulls the corresponding CS line low. Devices that have their CS line high won’t react at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously there are fancy devices on the market that will make dumping a NAND chip via SPI pretty easy and straightforward. Problem is, we couldn’t get any of them to work. They either didn’t fit (physically), were too fast or failed for some other strange reason we didn’t understand. So we wrote our own dump script onto an ESP32 using the SPI commands in the data sheet and let it forward the data to our computer via the USB console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing that, we ended up with a 544 MiB dump, containing 131,072 pages of 4096+256 bytes. (We will come back to that “+256” later on.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s dig into what this the flash dump contains with &lt;code&gt;binwalk&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sweet! We get a working ASCII copyright string, so something must have worked. And at the end of the image we have a bunch of UBIFS images. That’s probably where all the juicy files are!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s extract them with &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; and take a look inside with ubi_reader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm. That doesn’t work. Spoiler: The extracted image is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now if you’ve ever done something as hacky as this, you will know about a pesky little phenomenon that happens when you just solder copper wires onto a chip, stick that onto the ports of an ESP32 and do SPI communication - which has no built-in integrity checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Random Bit Flips&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are three dumps taken from the same NAND chip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you read 4 MiB of data from the chip, not all of the bits you receive are correct. And without any additional data, you have little way of knowing which ones are correct and which are not. If you are lucky, then the dumped data will still “work”, i.e., the contained file system will mount and you can browse files, but futher down the line you will have no way of knowing whether that weird function you’re reversing is actually weird or just the product of random bit flips messing up the CPU instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A relatively simple yet time-consuming way to get around this: Read the flash often (at least three times) and hold a majority vote for every bit. Since the bit flips are random and not too prevalent, they are less likely to hit the same bit twice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hot tip: If you’re gonna work with python, use numpy and work on arrays and memory-mapped files. Otherwise this can take a lot of time and a lot of RAM - even for a 512 MiB flash dump.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But isn’t there a better way? Yes, there is. And - btw - even with completely correct majority voting, the flash content is still broken. But we’ll get to that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to work with the majority-voted dump:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Out-of-band bytes and ECC troubles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing we have have silently brushed aside for now: The NAND chip distinguishes between “user data” and “extra data”. In our dump above, we have naively concatenated it all together and assumed that a page size of 4096+256 bytes somehow makes sense. Of course, it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, this majority voting hack is obviously not the “correct” way to work with a NAND chip. And even the proper SoC mounted on the proper mainboard can’t run a system off of a flash chip that gives it random bit flips that it can’t detect or recover from. The problem is that NAND is just inherently imperfect storage. Majority voting only corrects for transmission errors during dumping, but does nothing to bit errors that are stored on the device! Bits on the storage might decay over time, or the CPU might also have some transmission errors during writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course this problem has been very well known for a long time, so manufacturers always include some extra space next to user data for “error correction”. These extra bytes are called “out-of-band” bytes. And they are used to implement Error Correction Codes (ECC).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ECC according to the NAND chip data sheet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The flash chip implements its own error correction algorithm by reserving some of the space for ECC. It is split into&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2048 blocks of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;64 pages of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4096 user data bytes + 256 “extra” bytes (aka out-of-band bytes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;=&amp;gt; 512 MiB of user data (the chip is 4 Gb, not 4 GB)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;=&amp;gt; 32 MiB of extra data&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the chip-internal ECC is enabled, some of those extra bytes are used for ECC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, we naively assumed that each page would be&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4096 bytes of user data followed by&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;256 (or less?) bytes of ECC covering the previous 4096 bytes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, we quickly found out that the sequences classified as “extra data” contain readable strings! That definitely suggests that this isn’t ECC data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also see that there are parts within the user data where strings are suddenly cut off. This suggests that the ECC layout we assumed was wrong. It took us quite a while to figure out what exactly we missed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Entropy Analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out, the ECC layout is not just 4096 bytes of user data followed by 256 bytes of ECC. If we put all pages next to each other and then calculate the entropy over each n-th byte of a page, we will find that there are multiple sections with high entropy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are we looking at entropy? Well, because we expect the user data to have ASCII text (low entropy) every now and then and the ECC data to be mostly random-looking byte values (high entropy).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The graph we’re seeing up here suggests that there are sections of roughly 1 KiB of user data, followed by 28 bytes of ECC data. Specifically,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1028 B user data + 28 B ECC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1028 B user data + 28 B ECC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1028 B user data + 28 B ECC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1014 B user data + 28 B ECC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;142 B unused&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why these stranges values? And which ECC algorithm is that? We can choose to ignore that and just extract the user data sections and stitch them together. I won’t spam you with more &lt;code&gt;binwalk&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; screenshots and just tell you that that also won’t result in a readable UBIFS image. Fortunately, we find an explanation for these values in the next section!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ECC according to the SoC data sheet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, we had already spent a lot of time fiddling with unstable reading setups and ECC layouts. And then we found that some further digging into the right documentation could have saved us a lot of time during our research. Because the SoC also does ECC. Not just the NAND chip. In fact, we can ignore the NAND chips ECC feature completely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SoC’s data sheet lists several possible ECC layouts. One of them is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, that fits our findings perfectly, plus a BB (“bad blocks”) and CTRL (some kind of control bytes?) area that we didn’t identify before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using this diagram, we can cut out all the ECC, BB and CTRL sections and reconstruct the pure 512 MiB user data flash content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heyyy, look at that! We managed to extract a file system again - albeit with some error remaining. Let’s see what’s on it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm. Damn. The UBIFS image is now at least somewhat syntactically correct. But it is still broken enough to not have any files. Why could that be? Well, we are looking at exactly what the SoC would see after reading the data from the NAND chip. Plus that we have done majority voting on the bytes - so our version is even better than what the SoC would see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, there is no guarantee that there aren’t any random bit flips on the NAND chip, i.e., that random bit flipping happened during writing, desoldering or anytime between that! So, there seems to no way around actually implementing the ECC algorithm and correcting the bit flips on the flash dump. Problem is: What kind of ECC algorithm is the SoC running? Unfortunately, the datasheet is silent here, so we had to find out on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A short primer on reverse engineering ECC algorithms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typical ECC algorithms on NAND chips use BCH codes, which are parametrized by the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The amount of parity bits.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The correction capacity &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, i.e., how many simultaneous bit flips may appear in the same data block before the block is “too broken” and the ECC algorithm fails.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The primitive polynomial used in the equation. If you don’t know what this is, just think of it as an integer parameter for now.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whether and how the data is transformed before the parity bits are calculated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whether and how the parity bits are transformed after they are calculated.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can deduce (1) and (2) from our flash dump. For (3), (4), and (5) we have to either find the code of the SoC (if it is implement in software at all) and reverse engineer the ECC algorithm - or just bruteforce them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Amount of parity bits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we have seen in the SoC’s data sheet, we have 112 byte of ECC / parity bits. However, the fragmented layout on the flash suggests that we actually have 4 ECC groups of 28 byte, each covering a different part of the user data. Note that this is an educated guess and does not have to be true. If we’re not getting anywhere, we should consider dropping this assumption later on. But spoiler: We’re right about this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that we have 224 parity bits (= 28 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Correction capacity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This part we can just calculate if we make one very realistic assumption. We have 1028 bytes of user data, which is 8224 bits. If we want to represent these 8224 bits as a binary polynomial, we need at least degree 14:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2^13 =  8192&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt; - Too small
&lt;code&gt;2^14 = 16384&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt; - Fits!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means our primitive polynomial needs to be at least degree 14 (&lt;code&gt;m &amp;gt;= 14&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The correction capacity is determined by the degree &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; and the amount of parity bits. The more parity bits we have in relation to &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, the higher our correction capacity &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;t = parity_bits / m&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now given that &lt;code&gt;parity_bits&lt;/code&gt; is fixed at 224 and assuming that the engineers chose &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; to be maximal, we conclude that &lt;code&gt;m = 14&lt;/code&gt; and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;t = 224 / 14 = 16&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;meaning that we can correct for up to 16 bit flips in the covered user data chunk. Anything more than that and the chunk is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;t = 16&lt;/code&gt; also fits the description of the ECC section in the SoC’s data sheet: “16-Bit/1KB Error Correction Performance” (see our diagram above). So we are pretty certain that this assumption is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Primitive polynomial&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t know that and we will have to bruteforce it. Given that it is a binary polynomial, it is usually represented as a bit vector or simply as an integer. Given that &lt;code&gt;m = 14&lt;/code&gt; we already know that our polynomial must have its 14th bit set and that the 14th bit is the highest bit that is set:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;2^14 &amp;lt;= prim_poly &amp;lt; 2^15&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;which is well within bruteforcing range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Pre-encode and post-encode transformations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few transformations that are commonly applied to either the user data before calculating the parity bits (“encoding”) or applied to the parity bits after calculating them. Examples include&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reverse bit order&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reverse byte order&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;swap nibbles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;invert&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why you ask? Well, one of these combinations for example is very useful for NAND storage devices. You see, when NAND pages are erased and then read, their values are all &lt;code&gt;0xFF&lt;/code&gt;. Problem is, a page full of &lt;code&gt;0xFF&lt;/code&gt; will have&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;user data = &lt;code&gt;0xFFFF...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ECC = &lt;code&gt;0xFFFF...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and that is not a valid parity, meaning a cleanly erased page will be read as containing a lot of errors. That is because&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;parity(0xFF...) != 0xFF...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we can pull a trick to make this work: Before encoding, invert the user data. And after encoding, invert the parity bits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that the parity of an all-zero page is all-zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;parity(0x00...) != 0x00...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So by implementing our ECC algorithm with these two inversions, we make a freshly erased page (&lt;code&gt;0xFF...&lt;/code&gt;) have a valid parity (&lt;code&gt;0xFF...&lt;/code&gt;) and the SoC’s error correction won’t need special handling for erased NAND pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, back to the actual algorithm at hand here. How do we know that these two inversions are what the engineers actually chose? We don’t! We just try all these different transformations and see if one of them works. The amount of possible combinations of these 4 transformations is quite low and easily bruteforcable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Brute-forcing ECC parameters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, to test our guessed parameters, we need a user data section without errors, generate its ECC and check if it matches the ECC that we read off of the NAND chip. Our bruteforce script thus has to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find a “good” user data section with no bit flips and the corresponding ECC section.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterate through all possible transformations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterate through all possible primitive polynomials of degree 14&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each iteration, generate the ECC of the userdata section. If it matches the existing ECC, we have found the parameters.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Picking a “good” user data section&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need a user data section and its corresponding ECC section without bit flips. But how do we know that a section does not have bit flips? We don’t! We could try to be clever here. One possible approach would be to pick a section with a lot of text and check if the text makes sense. But the lazy approach works just as well: Just try a lot of sections and hope that one of them is correct. More bruteforce. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see in the script above, we only look at the first section of every page and then move on to the next page entirely. We’re not completely sure yet which ECC bytes cover which user data sections - especially since the 4th section looks fragmented. But we will stick to our assumption that the first 1028 bytes of user data are covered by the first 28 bytes of ECC. Spoiler: We’re right about this. Another Spoiler: The first 3 pages have bit-flips in their first section. The 4th one is good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Iterate through all possible transformations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will try out 4 different transformations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reverse bit order&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reverse byte order&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;swap nibbles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;invert&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these transformation we want all possible subsets and orderings, but without using the same transformation twice in one run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we can run through all these combinations as both pre-transformations as well as post-transformations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that some combinations are equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t optimize for that though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Iterate through all possible primitive polynomials of degree 14&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A simple and slow way&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A math-heavy and fast way&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A much better way that is about as simple as (1) and as fast as (2)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, we went with (1) during our initial research because sometimes thinking just takes longer than computing inefficiently. Afterwards, I spent hours digging into polynomial algebra to come up with (2) and was very happy about it - only to also find (3) right afterwards which was a lot simpler and equally as good… Oh well, at least I got to freshen up on first- and second-semester linear algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(1) Simple and slow The simple way would be to just try all polynomials of degree 14. In their integer representation, that’s all integers in &lt;code&gt;range(2**14, 2**15)&lt;/code&gt;
While this will eventually cover the correct primitive polynomial, it will also make bchlib crash the entire script with a SIGSEGV for a lot of non-primitive polynomials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick-and-dirty workaround is to just spawn a new process for every candidate polynomial so your main script doesn’t die. And that’s what we did during initial research. It works - but the creation of over 16,000 processes makes this a bit slow. Not too slow to work with though. This approach works in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(2) Math-heavy and fast The proper way to do this is to only pass primitive polynomials into BCH’s constructor. But how do we know if the polynomial that is represented by our integer is primitive? By doing lots of math. If you’re not familiar with polynomial algebra (like I was) but really want to know how this works, read the section A brief detour into polynomial algebra in the addendum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler: It is a lot of thinking work and only about 5% faster than (3) in my tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(3) Simple and fast Turns out, bchlib only crashes for polynomials with a constant term of 0, i.e., even integers. So if we use &lt;code&gt;range(2**14 + 1, 2**15, 2)&lt;/code&gt;, then it just works without having to fiddle with multiprocessing or math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will still throw a runtime error for a lot of non-primitive polynomials but we can catch that via try-except:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Checking the generated ECC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is straight-forward and self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find the full ECC Bruteforce Script in the addendum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Restoring the full firmware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have a working ECC setup, let’s reassemble the entire firmware! There is just one little detail that we still need to find out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which parts of user data are covered by which parts of ECC? We already confirmed that the first user data section is covered by the first 28 bytes of ECC. And the same turns out to be true for the second and third user data section. The fourth section is a bit tricky: It is 928+84 bytes of user data long, with additional BB and CTRL bytes around. What is that about? Turns out, a bit of trial-and-error and looking at the SoC’s data sheet revealed how ECC works for that section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we just need to apply that to every page and - voilà - full firmware dump. :tada:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Final Restore Script can be found in the addendum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we look at the binwalk output for that file, it is much better and looks like it is actually free of errors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When trying to extract the first ubifs image with ubi_reader, we actually get a working file system!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ubi_reader still throws an error in the later segments of UBIFS image but this extraction is good enough to start reverse engineering the successfully extracted files. Notably, it is enough to reverse engineer the firmware decryption!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for Part 2 of our drone hacking blogpost where we dive into the reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis of the Potensic Atom 2!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Addendum&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fun Fuckups&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A brief detour into polynomial algebra&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are like me and you’re not really familiar with polynomial algebra, it makes sense to talk about related concepts in the integer world first and then move on to their counterparts in the polynomial world. This helps to get an intuition of what we are actually dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I assume that you are generally familiar with modular arithmetic and prime numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Integers and Modulo Rings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, we are working on the field of integers, i.e., , mathematically denoted .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we introduce a modulus, we get . Explanation for the notation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is some modulus. Not necessary prime at this point. Just an integer - a member of .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is all multiples of . So . If were , this would be .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now means: The field but treat all elements as equivalent if they are a multiple of apart - meaning their difference is in . If were , then and would be equivalent, because their difference is , which is a multiple of and thus in .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly what “mod 7” is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So is just all of .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that this collapses the infinite field of all possible integers down to a finite set of equivalence classes. In , all numbers are either in or are equivalents of one of those. So for practical purposes, there are only possible values in .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do we need primes for? Well, has a practical problem: Sometimes multiplying two things results in a zero. Example for :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is bad if we want to do a lot of multiplication within our modulo ring. Because if we ever accidentally hit a multiple of , we will get and that point it doesn’t matter what we multiply onto that - it will stay . So there are a lot of possible values that all collapse into the same when multiplied with certain numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the field of all integers, , we don’t have that problem. As long as we don’t multiply with itself, the results of a multiplication will never be . Good thing there is a solution for that: Using a prime modulus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Prime Numbers, Finite Fields, and Cycles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prime numbers have the nice feature that the modulo rings they induce, , are fields and not just rings, meaning addition and multiplication work just as well as they do in . In , multiplying by something other than will never result in a multiple of - because is prime and you can’t reach a prime from another number through multiplication. (Multiplying by itself doesn’t count, because .)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because is a field and it has a finite amount of elements , it is called a “finite field” or a “Galois field” and sometimes denoted instead of . To be super precise, is a generalization and means “any finite field with elements”. just happens to be one of those - and is the most popular one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we go a step further and look at a concept called primitive root. Before explaining that, let’s take a look at a use case for them first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine you want a pseudorandom permutation of , i.e., you don’t want the sequence but a more random-looking sequence tha still hits all of these numbers. It doesn’t have to be cryptographically random or unpredictable. It just needs to look at bit random - perhaps to de-cluster memory writes for better wear-leveling. Primitive roots give us a nice implementation for that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In , multiplication never yields unless you multiply by . That means you can, e.g., keep doubling a number and will never accidentally hit :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh look at that, a cycle! This is what will always happen in a finite field. When you keep multiplying by the same number, you will eventually reach the number you started with. And at that point, you are in a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is a bit impractical though because its induced cycle only ever hits the numbers and never hits . Note that no cycle will ever hit , so the maximum cycle we can possible get with a modulus of is cycle length .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Primitive Roots and Prime Factors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there are indeed numbers that generate a full cycle!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These numbers, numbers that induce a full cycle in a finite field, are called primitive roots. and are each primitive roots modulo . Since their induced cycle has a length of , the so-called order of and is .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More generally, a primitive root modulo some prime is a number whose order is , i.e., whose induced cycle has a length of . In that case . Expressed more formally: is a primitive root modulo if and only if the smallest for which is true, is&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now then how would you best check if a number is a primitive root modulo ? The obvious solution is to just count upwards from 1 through and check each time. That works but it can take a long time for big numbers. Turns out, we don’t have to check every possible from through . To understand that, take a look at from before:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see that the cycle has length and contains the numbers . We don’t see the numbers . But what happens when we use but we start at ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, a cycle of ! And this time we’ve seen all the remaining numbers . If we instead start at or , we will get the same cycle over . So splits the entire finite field excluding 0 into two subsets: and .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s look at another example: and try to find all cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So partitions the non-zero elements into `.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice how all those cycles induced by the same number always have the same size? If you think about it, then that makes perfect sense. When you have but you “start at ”, you’re basically just taking the regular cycle and multiply its elements by . So the resulting cycle must have the same length: .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this isn’t a coincidence. In fact, all cycles induced by the same number always have the same length. And that number always partitions the entire finite field without into disjoint sets of the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does that help us? Well, for it makes the cycle lengths and impossible! Because you can’t cover all non-zero elements by splitting them into sets of size or . More generally, cycles lengths (and thus orders) must always be a divisor of , i.e., the amount of all non-zero elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is called Lagrange’s theorem: The order of the subgroup divides the order of the whole group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So to check if is a primitive root, we don’t have to check all from through . We only have to check all divisors of ! Also, we obviously don’t have to check . The only number for which is itself, which always induces a cycle of and is thus never a primitive root for .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we’re down to only having to check all divisors of that are larger than . That already eliminates most of the candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we can go even further!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fast Primitivity Check&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We only need to check some of the divisors. This is where prime factorization comes into play. Let’s say that we have the prime factors of . We will call these prime factors . Note that itself does not have any prime factors because - well - it is a prime number. But does have prime factors. In fact, will always be one of those prime factors because must be odd to be a prime and must therefore be even.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now what if I told you that we only need to check the divisors of that we can obtain by dividing through a prime factor. Specifically, we only need to check&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is that? Well, first of all, notice that the “other divisors” are themselves divisors of either or :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if , then that implies that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Well, because if were equal to one, then&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and that is a contradiction! You can prove the same for any in general if you want. The general proof works just like this example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, so we only have to check all possible with being a prime factor of .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a generator function that will return all primitive roots for a given prime modulus :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you know what? Armed with this, we can not just find primitive roots but also primitive polynomials! We just need to translate this concept to polynomials!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;… which is a bit tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Binary Polynomials, Irreducibility and Primitive Elements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, first things first: Polynomials. They can look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And through the black magic of math, we can treat these polynomials as multidimensional numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And on these, we can perform the same kind of arithmetic as on integers: Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction, Division - and thus Modulo. Dividing one polynomial by another sounds odd? It is. We’ll skip the details here since we’ve already derailed enough. Just know that the intuition from integer arithmetic carries over to polynomials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now keep in mind that we are working with binary polynomials, i.e., polynomials whose coefficients are either or . And we can represent those as integers. For example, represents the polynomial&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use these binary polynomials because they have a numbers of nice properties that things like BCH error correction codes rely on. For example, we can represent all binary strings of length as a -degree polynomial with binary coefficients. For integers, we’d represent those strings as integers from to . But we would have problems doing modular arithmetic on those strings because isn’t necessarily prime and then isn’t a field. For polynomials, there are nice and efficient ways to build a field over -degree binary polynomials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout this section we have to keep in mind that the integer representation ( in the example above) is just a representation of the polynomial in memory. The polynomial is not an integer and we can’t just do regular integer arithmetic like addition and multiplication with Python’s &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; with it. Polynomials have their own arithmetic and they work differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we are dealing with binary polynomials, the coefficients of the polynomials are all either or . More formally, the coefficients are elements of , which is basically the same as or “mod 2”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The set of all binary polynomials is called . In CompSci terms, these are all possible bit arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So since we’re moving from working on integers to working on binary polynomials, is our binary polynomial-equivalent of , with being all integers and being all binary polynomials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we used to represent a single integer in , we will use to represent a single polynomial in .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to how is the set of all multiples of n, is the set of all multiples of - notice the double-paranthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And similar to how is but treating two integers as equivalent if their difference is a multiple of , is but treating two polynomials as equivalent if their difference is a multiple of . It is essentially “mod ” in polynomial world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we have an integer and can’t be divided by another integer, then is prime. Analogously, if we have a polynomial and can’t be reduced by another polynomial, then is irreducible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If is prime, then there is at least one primitive root in , so that spans the entire . If is irreducible, then there is at least one primitive element in so that spans the entire .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Side note: “primitive root” is a legacy term only used for . “primitive element” is the general term. They mean the same thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, while the order of is just , the order of is , which is the amount of all possible -bit arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we are almost there! We have already come far enough where we can recognize that an irreducible polynomial is analogous to a prime integer .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, what is a primitive polynomial then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Primitive Polynomials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, that’s simple! A primitive polynomial is an irreducible polynomial with one additional requirement:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The super simple polynomial must be a primitive element, i.e., must span the entire .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is that useful? Well, because that means that every non-zero polynomial in can be represented as for some integer . So every non-zero polynomial can be represented as an integer and we have a random-looking permutation of all non-zero binary polynomials in .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that is what BCH codes use and why we require a primitive polynomial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, how do we calculate all primitive polynomials then? We don’t. There are infinitely many. But we can calculate all primitive polynomials of some specific degree ! And how do we do that? Well, using what we have already built for finding primitive roots for integers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterate through all possible polynomials of degree . For each candidate , (step 1) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;check if irreducible. Discard if not. (step 2)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;check if (the simple polynomial with integer representation 2) is a primitive element in the finite field induced by . (step 3) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;the wanted cycle length is the amount of all possible polynomials of degree :&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;get all prime factors of&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;check if for all prime factors&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For (step 1), we want a primitive polynomial with degree , so we only consider polynomials where their m-th coefficient is 1 and all higher-order coefficients are 0. This means that their integer representations are in&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;range(2^m, 2^(m+1))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To speed it up by factor 2: We can’t have any polynomials where the constant term, i.e., the lowest-order coefficient is zero. Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(note that there is no at the end)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s because every polynomial with a zero constant term is divisible by the polynomial and is thus not irreducible and thus not primitive. So we only iterate over polynomials with a constant term of . In the integer representation, those are the odd integers, so we use&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;range(2^m + 1, 2^(m-1), 2)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For (step 2), checking whether a polynomial is irreducible is the analogue to checking whether an integer is prime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruling out even integer representations of polynomials in (1) skips half the possible candidates because those are all reducible. Unfortunately, there will still be plenty of reducible polynomials left. Just like there are a lot of non-prime numbers among the odd integers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a full irreducibility test, we use Rabin’s Test. The implementation has a similar structure as the Rabin-Miller Test for integers. We won’t cover either here because this section is long enough already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For (step 3), we do the same as for primitive roots in integer-world, except we use a polynomial-compatible &lt;code&gt;pow&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Finding all Primitive Polynomials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now we can finally compute all the primitive polynomials with degree 14. The full script is attached in the addendum. It takes about 1 second (single-threaded, on my laptop) to list all 756 primitive polynomials for degree 14. Yes - there are only 756!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And how much faster does this make our script compared to the naive &lt;code&gt;range(2**14 + 1, 2**15, 2)&lt;/code&gt;
that lists half of all possible binary polynomials of degree 14?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 1 second on a single-threaded run on my laptop…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out just throwing a bunch of mostly non-primitive polynomials against bchlib and catching the exception is just as fast as doing it properly…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, and you know what? You could have also just pulled a list of all primitive polynomials of degree 14 from the internet. Because, well, we aren’t the first to generate that list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But hey, we learned some math.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Crypto grifters are recruiting open-source AI developers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two recently-hyped developments in AI engineering have been Geoff Huntley’s “Ralph Wiggum loop” and Steve Yegge’s “Gas Town”. Huntley and Yegge are both respected software engineers with a long pedigree of actual projects. The Ralph loop is a sensible idea: force infinite test-time-compute by automatically restarting Claude Code whenever it runs out of steam. Gas Town is a platform for an idea that’s been popular for a while (though in my view has never really worked): running a whole village of LLM agents that collaborate with each other to accomplish a task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, so good. But Huntley and Yegge have also been posting about $RALPH and $GAS, which are cryptocurrency coins built on top of the longstanding Solana cryptocurrency and the Bags tool, which allows people to easily create their own crypto coins. What does $RALPH have to do with the Ralph Wiggum loop? What does $GAS have to do with Gas Town?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From reading Huntley and Yegge’s posts, it seems like what happened was this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some crypto trader created a “$GAS” coin via Bags, configuring it to pay a portion of the trading fees to Steve Yegge (via his Twitter account)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That trader, or others with the same idea, messaged Yegge on LinkedIn to tell him about his “earnings” (currently $238,000), framing it as support for the Gas Town project&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yegge took the free money and started posting about how exciting $GAS is as a way to fund open-source software creators&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what does $GAS have to do with Gas Town (or $RALPH with Ralph Wiggum)? From a technical perspective, the answer is nothing. Gas Town is an open-source GitHub repository that you can clone, edit and run without ever interacting with the $GAS coin. Likewise for Ralph. Buying $GAS or $RALPH does not unlock any new capabilities in the tools. All it does is siphon a little bit of money to Yegge and Huntley, and increase the value of the $GAS or $RALPH coins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, that’s why these coins exist in the first place. This is a new variant of an old “airdropping” cryptocurrency tactic. The classic problem with “memecoins” is that it’s hard to give people a reason to buy them, even at very low prices, because they famously have no staying power. That’s why many successful memecoins rely on celebrity power, like Eric Adams’ “NYC Token” or the $TRUMP coin. But how do you convince a celebrity to get involved in your &lt;del&gt;grift&lt;/del&gt; business venture?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where Bags comes in. Bags allows you to nominate a Twitter account as the beneficiary (or “fee earner”) of your coin. The person behind that Twitter account doesn’t have to agree, or even know that you’re doing it. Once you accumulate a nominal market cap (for instance, by moving a bunch of your own money onto the coin), you can then message the owner of that Twitter account and say “hey, all these people are supporting you via crypto, and you can collect your money right now if you want!” Then you either subtly hint that promoting the coin would cause that person to make more money, or you wait for them to realize it themselves1. Once they start posting about it, you’ve bootstrapped your own celebrity coin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system relies on your celebrity target being dazzled by receiving a large sum of free money. If you came to them before the money was there, they might ask questions like “why wouldn’t people just directly donate to me?”, or “are these people who think they’re supporting me going to lose all their money?“. But in the warm glow of a few hundred thousand dollars, it’s easy to think that it’s all working out excellently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this is why AI open-source software engineers make such great targets. The fact that they’re open-source software engineers means that (a) a few hundred thousand dollars is enough to dazzle them2, and (b) their fans are technically-engaged enough to be able to figure out how to buy cryptocurrency. Working in AI also means that there’s a fresh pool of hype to draw from (the general hype around cryptocurrency being somewhat dry by now). On top of that, the open-source AI community is fairly small. Yegge mentions in his post that he wouldn’t have taken the offer seriously if Huntley hadn’t already accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you couldn’t tell, I think this whole thing is largely predatory. Bags seems to me to be offering crypto-airdrop-pump-and-dumps-as-a-service, where niche celebrities can turn their status as respected community figures into cold hard cash. The people who pay into this are either taken in by the pretense that they’re sponsoring open-source work (in a way orders of magnitude less efficient than just donating money directly), or by the hope that they’re going to win big when the coin goes “to the moon” (which effectively never happens).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The celebrities will make a little bit of money, for their part in it, but the lion’s share of the reward will go to the actual grifters: the insiders who primed the coin and can sell off into the flood of community members who are convinced to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bags even offers a “Did You Get Bagged? 💰🫵” section in their docs, encouraging the celebrity targets to share the coin, and framing the whole thing as coming from “your community”.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a dig - that amount of money would dazzle me too! I only mean that you wouldn’t be able to get Tom Cruise or MrBeast to promote your coin with that amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Gas Town is a glimpse into the future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first encountered Gas Town, I was already familiar with some of Steve Yegge’s work, especially his infamous 2011, accidentally public, Google memo. In it, Yegge recounted what Jeff Bezos had mandated at Amazon in 2002: every service from every team everywhere within Amazon must be exposed as an API. This mandate would eventually be what led to AWS’s emergence, invention, and market dominance. It’s no mistake that the AWS platform is the way it is because of this API and team service-oriented architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yegge said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Golden Rule of Platforms, “Eat Your Own Dogfood”, can be rephrased as “Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything.” You can’t just bolt it on later. Certainly not easily at any rate – ask anyone who worked on platformizing MS Office. Or anyone who worked on platformizing Amazon. If you delay it, it’ll be ten times as much work as just doing it correctly up front. You can’t cheat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even before the commodification of the cloud, Kubernetes, containers, and platform engineering, Yegge had a keen understanding of where the industry had been, where it was, and the direction it was going. He knew that the “platform” was of the utmost importance for future business success and that bolting it on after the fact would be excruciatingly painful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Yegge launched Gas Town last week, a multi-agent harness backed by beads, his open source agentic “task” tracking system, it’s no surprise that the AI engineering world took notice. When Yegge peers into the future, he seems to have a unique perspective with a proven track record for seeing something the rest don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gas Town is intentionally esoteric: it’s very important to understand that this is by design. There are literal towns of agents with a Mayor to manage them, a “truth” observer called “The Witness”, Polecats who actually get things done, a god-like entity called the Observer (you) who hands the mayor mandates like Moses receiving commandments from Mount Sinai, Deacons for periodically telling Polecats to go and actually do their job, a Refinery where code can get merged properly as the many agents swarm to add their changes, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But upon using Gas Town, you start to see this vision that Yegge is trying to paint. You begin to understand the multi-agent “platform” that he is crafting and telling a story through. Like an art installation, Gas Town isn’t really meant to be used: it’s meant to change how you think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s look briefly at a feature I gave Gas Town to go and implement in a large private project I was working on: the code for this isn’t really that interesting. The process is. At a very high level, a Gas Town workflow involves you giving the Mayor something you want done. Then, it’ll dispatch all the agent workers to go and get it finished eventually producing a code artifact from the Refinery:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I rigged up the three code bases I knew that the agents would need: the core runtime, the admin dashboard, and the public API. This effectively clones the repos and adds them to the agent’s workspace (the Town).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gt rig add core git@github.com:org/core.git
gt rig add dashboard git@github.com:org/dashboard.git
gt rig add api git@github.com:org/api.git&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I attached to the Mayor session to tell it what I wanted it to do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gt mayor attach&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; Inspect the public API
&amp;gt; and implement adding core runtime flags to accounts
&amp;gt; in the admin dashboard.
&amp;gt; I should be able to find an account and add a flag for that account.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew that the agents would need to do a few things across these different code bases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;inspect the shape of the public API in the &lt;code&gt;api&lt;/code&gt;repo (this is where adding runtime flags for accounts actually happens and is supported by a&lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;) and possibly add additional capabilities like a&lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;for fetching all runtime flags.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;inspect how runtime flags in the &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt;repo actually work: these flags are specific to how individual accounts are configured and it’s very important context for actually using the API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;add the capabilities into the admin dashboard (i.e., understand how the Admin dashboard works, utilize the API, build the UI, implement the feature).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I let it loose!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using Gas Town, there are moments where you think things have completely gone off the rails: at one point, I saw a Deacon scorn a Polecat for not being on task resulting in the Polecat throwing away its entire git worktree only to start over. The Mayor reported back to me that “Things have gone poorly” when that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But eventually, without any additional prompting, the Mayor reported they had finished. I was surprised! I was able to actually get a pretty good result from this large multi-codebase setup: looking at the artifacts, I saw that a Polecat had opened a PR on the dashboard repo in GitHub, my team reviewed it, and we merged it through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s very easy to look at Gas Town and blow it off as some fever dream, something that no serious engineer or organization would actually approve of using. It’s confusing, expensive, unsafe, and impractical. Further, you can probably get similar results by having a few tabs of Claude Code open and managing the context yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if we look at Gas Town not as a tool but a glimpse into the future, we start to see a very different story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A story that tells us there’s a multi-agent future where coding, working, and delegating tasks looks wildly different from how it does today: hence its esoteric nature and naming. It’s much easier to tell an almost whimsical story about the future using Mayors, Towns, truth seekers, and gardens vs. workers, orchestrators, and merge queues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gas Town shows us that with a bit of bubble gum and duct tape (where all products, services, and infrastructure start!), you can get quite far orchestrating multiple agents to go and do large ambiguous tasks all while their context is being managed autonomously. Let’s not forget that just over a year ago Claude Code was first being released to the public! And practical, working multi-agent setups seemed infinitely far away!! Just getting single agent systems to work was a miracle! Yet, here we are, despite how expensive it is, with a working multi-agent setup I can run locally!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The true innovation of Gas Town is that it takes what coding agents do really well, extends them, and wrangles the necessary pieces for them to work together at the same time: it bootstraps all the files, metadata, and repos for agents automatically (which unsurprisingly reminds me a lot of &lt;code&gt;brazil&lt;/code&gt;, the internal Amazon build and code management tool
that handles nearly all software dependencies within the company).
It also orchestrates the agent context and task management automatically through &lt;code&gt;beads&lt;/code&gt;,
Yegge’s SQLite agentic task tracker.
All this without much human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that Yegge picked the name Gas Town, a dystopian fictional place in the Mad Max universe where crude oil is turned to gas for vehicles and war machines. Essentially the only infrastructure remaining in a total wasteland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Gas Town convinces me of anything, it’s that we’re drastically lacking any kind of system for safety, governance, durability, compliance, or observability. Just like the lack of infrastructure in the Mad Max dystopia, Gas Town expects you to utilize its orchestration without a care for what’s happening, all run in Claude Code “unsafe” mode. It’s clear that multi-agent systems and orchestrators are right around the corner: but what happens when we don’t have the necessary telemetry, tools, or infrastructure to understand why these agents went off to do what they did? Furthermore, running Gas Town outside of a sandbox (which seems to be the way most people run it) opens your entire system up to potentially catastrophic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ungoverned agent orchestration is a leaky abstraction. Any tool calls, file reads, reasoning blocks, or tasks completed by the agent are lost to the ether:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reality, this is not really a multi-agent problem: we’ve yet to have good tooling for safely running, understanding, or governing single-threaded agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gas Town just amplifies the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s all fun and games when my Polecat nukes its own git worktree, but in the future, in a real production setting, when a multi-agent system, let alone a single agent system, decides to do something catastrophic that the original prompter did not foresee, what systems will be in place to monitor, understand, or catch the what and the why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gas Town is a glimpse into the future: a dark, grim future where we are still catching up on the tooling and infrastructure to support multi-agent workflows. With Gas Town, Yegge is showing us that the “platform” of multi-agent workloads and orchestration is nearly here. And without the tooling, observability, infrastructure, and services to handle that platform, bolting it on after the fact will be extremely painful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The multi-agent platform is nearly here. The infrastructure isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plan to continue exploring agent telemetry, infrastructure, and tooling in my writing, so follow along here or on Bluesky. Much more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
