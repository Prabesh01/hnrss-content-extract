    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;an opinionated critique of duolingo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the stay-at-home grim days of 2020, I started learning Spanish on Duolingo. Having a working understanding of Spanish seemed like a sensible first step towards opening a taco truck in Mexico, in case I had to run away from my doctoral studies. This July, after about 5 years I decided to end the 1800 day streak that I managed to drag on with numerous streak freezes and minimal effort lessons. While Spanish words look less foreign, and with some focus, I am able to decipher small paragraphs of grammatically simple sentences; the effort was less than a smashing success – I certainly could not be writing this essay in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Duolingo is known for anything, it has to be their gamification approach. There is no shortage of gamification mechanics on the platform: XP; potions to double your XP; leagues of gold, silver, and all sorts of other metals and minerals; treasure chests; quests; monthly quests; and so on. I have only ever paid little attention to these mechanics. While I still haven’t entirely rejected the idea that a good RPG could be a good scaffolding to teach a language, I do not think Duolingo is one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Games worth their salt are not created by bolting together a collection of numerical statistics. That is how you get cookie clicker. I did not have a good understanding of how the mechanics work: if I learn 10 words, how many XP do I get for my hard work? Is the Diamond League higher or lower than the Obsidian League? I could have viewed their documentation to figure it out, but there was nothing motivating me to do so. If I collect 100 XP, what does it mean for my language skills? For that matter, why do I collect extra XP when I receive a potion? Can the XP I collect be used in a way to carefully guide me towards the specific language skills I would explore next? Navigating the mechanical gameplay of Duolingo is neither rewarding for its own sake, nor is it helpful towards actually learning a language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duolingo is not just a poor simulacrum of the mechanical aspects of a game, but also of the social aspects of one. Who are all these people I am on the Silver league with? Having a comparable amount of XP does not give me a sense of social connection with them. When I click a button to congratulate a friend on Duolingo, I do not truly engage with their learning journey. Indeed, it is worse than hearting an instagram photo, or upvoting a reddit thread. In those cases, I am reacting to a sliver of expression from my acquaintance. Here, I am presented only with a pre-rendered text with an abstract numerical statistic. Reacting to it is deliberately frictionless: I am presented with a wall of buttons allowing me to click them with ease and without thought. When Duolingo tells me that so and so sent me a message saying “Hey, come back and learn Spanish with me!”, I don’t admire how thoughtful and encouraging my friend is; I just notice that they clicked a button to send me a pre-generated message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interactions on Duolingo were not always of the push-button variety. Duolingo had forums where users would discuss different aspects of their language learning journey. In fact, Duolingo would link each sentence to its own forum thread for discussion – discussion, which was at the very least, helpful, and at times, eye-opening. At first, these discussion threads were locked, and later removed. My hypothesis is that for the business geniuses running Duolingo, the forums were assesed to be a liability, having to moderate which were not worth spending the dollars for. The nature of interacting with people – friends or strangers, in person or online – is that sometimes bad things would happen. Even when there is no abuse or harassment going on, there is always the risk that the other person might greet you with disagreement, or worse, apathy. Many people tend to think that the risks outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gamification mechanic that I did latch on to was the Streak. I generally have been critical of the green owl, but I do think that it did help me form a good habit – a net positive, despite the minuscule magnitude. Regular Duolingo users will know that the streak can be gamed away in more than one ways. Streak Freezes can be bought using gems (of which I happen to have 24,053 of, somehow) or be gifted by your friends, and equipped 2 at a time. Streaks wouldn’t have their social effect if there weren’t enough people with a moderate number of people with decent streaks to be sprinkled around. Maintaining the streak, even without freezes, does not have to mean that you are learning – repeating a simple lesson from several units ago would work. My 1800 day streak didn’t mean that I spent 1800 days learning Spanish; it meant that I spent a large number of days engaging with the platform. I later started peeking into the Japanese and Finnish courses, and the 1800 day number includes them. If you loose interest in languages, Duolingo tells us that spending time with math or music will count towards your Streak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deficiency of Duolingo’s pedagogy was first made obvious to me by the excellent audio lessons produced by Language Transfer. Going through the first few lessons of Language Transfer, I was unfazed, observing that I had already learnt what was being taught. Soon, what shocked me was how quickly Language Transfer caught up to what I had managed to learn in a couple years of time. While Duolingo is great at making sure that the user comes back to the app everyday, their pedagogy is subpar. Remaining true to gamification, Duolingo prefers to throw users head-first into translation exercises. If you do not know a word, you hover over it and you arrange a given bag of words into a sentence that is hopefully meaningful. Grammar lessons are extremely minimal. The removal of the forums dedicated to the discussion of specific sentences did not help. Understanding the course outline – knowing what is taught where, or reviewing lessons – is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supposedly, the Duolingo philosophy is that if you are exposed to enough sentences, you will eventually learn how to use them. I do believe this is true, and I do believe the exercises are indispensable. However, the whole process could be greatly improved by a few more lessons interspersed in the curriculum telling the student what is going on. To see this, I would ask myself, did I always internalize the grammatically correct structures even in my own mother tongue? I think not, and my language skills have improved when my parents or teachers would point out simple grammatical mistakes. Eggcorns are a closely related amusing phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I cannot tell if Duolingo repeats different concepts in exercises adaptively based on your mastery, or are simply fixed in the course material. Repetition is good for learning but Duolingo’s repetition can be frustrating. The platform’s interface is largely built around clicking a bag of jumbled words one at a time to input a translation. Once you learn a concept well enough, most of your mental energy is spent on the finding and clicking of the words rather than the translation. Thankfully, this situation can be made better by dictating your answer, as pointed out by the official blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duolingo does include a few other formats for their lessons. There are some stories, which are interspersed in the course. The stories are short, but silly and enjoyable. There are also audio only lessons, which are also shorter and unfortunately, not as fun. From time to time, the regular lessons also ask you to speak to the microphone but in my experience, the audio recognition seems to accept the answer even if I mumble through the words. Duolingo is also known for its usage of bizarre phrases, whose shock value generates social media buzz and may or may not have a positive pedagogical effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duolingo is a neat case study in Silicon Valley ideology. Big tech embraces blitz-scaling: the primary goal is neither financial sustainability nor the quality of materials but making the number of users grow. The faux gamification and passive-aggressive messaging may be helpful with little else, but is good for user retention. The expansionism does not stop at growing the number of users; Duolingo has decided that they must loop in music and math learners as well. As we have discussed, the maxim of friction reduction has guided them towards optimizing away authenticity in the user interactions on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April 2025, Duolingo decided to go AI-first. Supposedly, “to teach well, [they] need to create a massive amount of content” – so much so that “doing [it] manually does not scale”. For the top ten languages, I cannot imagine any reasonable person saying that the lack of study material is the main obstacle towards learning. This statement spells out what the Duolingo executives value. The Duolingo CEO is not shy to admit it. In an interview with NPR, he said the following.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[I]f it’s our content, as in, like, our learning content, there’s so much of that - thousands and thousands and thousands of kind of sentences and words and paragraphs. That is mostly done by computers, and we probably spot-check it. But if it’s things like the user interface of Duolingo, where we say - like, you know, the button says quit, and we have to translate, that is all done with humans. And we spend a lot of effort on that, but that’s because each one of those is highly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, the button that says ‘quit’ is more valuable than the learning material, which is only ‘probably’ spot-checked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After I moved to Japan, I dialed up my efforts to learn Japanese. For a while, I shifted over my Duolingo habits to Japanese. Because Duolingo wasn’t my only learning material for Japanese, it was glaringly obvious very soon that the Duolingo pedagogy is unhelpful and often misleading. While the Spanish learner has to introduce themselves to a few new concepts (e.g, ser vs estar, or reflexive verbs), the Japanese learner faces an explosion of differences. Japanese has a writing system with three components; generally uses a topic-comment structure and often omits the topic; has a subject-object-verb order; has adjectives which conjugate; a lot of counting suffixes; sentence ending particles and famously, a complex honorific system. Duolingo does not break its gamification façade to teach the user some of these concepts head-on. Instead, it pretends that translating between Japanese and English is a matter of substituting phrases and shuffling them around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I gave up on my Duolingo streak, I have started exploring other avenues to continue learning Japanese. I participate in group lessons with a tutor once a week for an hour. Believe it or not, the tutor has more charm than Falstaff. I regularly do my flashcard kanji study with Wanikani. A newer addition to my study routine is Bunpro. My progress has been slow but evident: when I recognize that the names of the metro stations I frequent break down into simple words, they lose a little bit of their mystery but it is a satisfying revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These platforms are a welcome contrast against the techno-accelerationist attitude of Duolingo. Instead of trying to do it all, they are extremely niche: they only teaching one language and Wanikani is focused at teaching a very specific element of it. Wanikani maintains a public API, which makes third-party apps and scripts possible. I praise them for their welcome attitude towards interoperability instead of trying to build a closed ecosystem. Both Wanikani and Bunpro have vibrant user forums. Bunpro makes actual lessons part of their critical path, instead of hoping that the user will eventually figure it out. When a Bunpro user feels that their lesson was not adequate, they do not have to rely on AI generated slop – Bunpro directs users to carefully-crafted lessons by other people (see the ‘resource’ section at the end of this page, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designing agentic loops&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;30th September 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding agents like Anthropic’s Claude Code and OpenAI’s Codex CLI represent a genuine step change in how useful LLMs can be for producing working code. These agents can now directly exercise the code they are writing, correct errors, dig through existing implementation details, and even run experiments to find effective code solutions to problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is so often the case with modern AI, there is a great deal of depth involved in unlocking the full potential of these new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A critical new skill to develop is designing agentic loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to think about coding agents is that they are brute force tools for finding solutions to coding problems. If you can reduce your problem to a clear goal and a set of tools that can iterate towards that goal a coding agent can often brute force its way to an effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My preferred definition of an LLM agent is something that runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal. The art of using them well is to carefully design the tools and loop for them to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The joy of YOLO mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Picking the right tools for the loop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issuing tightly scoped credentials&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When to design an agentic loop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is still a very fresh area&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The joy of YOLO mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are inherently dangerous—they can make poor decisions or fall victim to malicious prompt injection attacks, either of which can result in harmful results from tool calls. Since the most powerful coding agent tool is “run this command in the shell” a rogue agent can do anything that you could do by running a command yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An AI agent is an LLM wrecking its environment in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding agents like Claude Code counter this by defaulting to asking you for approval of almost every command that they run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is kind of tedious, but more importantly, it dramatically reduces their effectiveness at solving problems through brute force.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these tools provides its own version of what I like to call YOLO mode, where everything gets approved by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so dangerous, but it’s also key to getting the most productive results!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are three key risks to consider from unattended YOLO mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bad shell commands deleting or mangling things you care about.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exfiltration attacks where something steals files or data visible to the agent—source code or secrets held in environment variables are particularly vulnerable here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attacks that use your machine as a proxy to attack another target—for DDoS or to disguise the source of other hacking attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to run YOLO mode anyway, you have a few options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run your agent in a secure sandbox that restricts the files and secrets it can access and the network connections it can make.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use someone else’s computer. That way if your agent goes rogue, there’s only so much damage they can do, including wasting someone else’s CPU cycles.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Take a risk! Try to avoid exposing it to potential sources of malicious instructions and hope you catch any mistakes before they cause any damage.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people choose option 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the existence of container escapes I think option 1 using Docker or the new Apple container tool is a reasonable risk to accept for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Option 2 is my favorite. I like to use GitHub Codespaces for this—it provides a full container environment on-demand that’s accessible through your browser and has a generous free tier too. If anything goes wrong it’s a Microsoft Azure machine somewhere that’s burning CPU and the worst that can happen is code you checked out into the environment might be exfiltrated by an attacker, or bad code might be pushed to the attached GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other agent-like tools that run code on other people’s computers. Code Interpreter mode in both ChatGPT and Claude can go a surprisingly long way here. I’ve also had a lot of success (ab)using OpenAI’s Codex Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding agents themselves implement various levels of sandboxing, but so far I’ve not seen convincing enough documentation of these to trust them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: It turns out Anthropic have their own documentation on Safe YOLO mode for Claude Code which says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letting Claude run arbitrary commands is risky and can result in data loss, system corruption, or even data exfiltration (e.g., via prompt injection attacks). To minimize these risks, use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--dangerously-skip-permissions&lt;/code&gt;in a container without internet access. You can follow this reference implementation using Docker Dev Containers.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locking internet access down to a list of trusted hosts is a great way to prevent exfiltration attacks from stealing your private source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Picking the right tools for the loop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve found a safe (enough) way to run in YOLO mode, the next step is to decide which tools we need to make available to the coding agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can bring MCP into the mix at this point, but I find it’s usually more productive to think in terms of shell commands instead. Coding agents are really good at running shell commands!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your environment allows them the necessary network access, they can also pull down additional packages from NPM and PyPI and similar. Ensuring your agent runs in an environment where random package installs don’t break things on your main computer is an important consideration as well!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than leaning on MCP, I like to create an AGENTS.md (or equivalent) file with details of packages I think they may need to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a project that involved taking screenshots of various websites I installed my own shot-scraper CLI tool and dropped the following in &lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;To take a screenshot, run:

shot-scraper http://www.example.com/ -w 800 -o example.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just that one example is enough for the agent to guess how to swap out the URL and filename for other screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good LLMs already know how to use a bewildering array of existing tools. If you say "use playwright python" or "use ffmpeg" most models will use those effectively—and since they’re running in a loop they can usually recover from mistakes they make at first and figure out the right incantations without extra guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Issuing tightly scoped credentials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to exposing the right commands, we also need to consider what credentials we should expose to those commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally we wouldn’t need any credentials at all—plenty of work can be done without signing into anything or providing an API key—but certain problems will require authenticated access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a deep topic in itself, but I have two key recommendations here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try to provide credentials to test or staging environments where any damage can be well contained.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If a credential can spend money, set a tight budget limit.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll use an example to illustrate. A while ago I was investigating slow cold start times for a scale-to-zero application I was running on Fly.io.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realized I could work a lot faster if I gave Claude Code the ability to directly edit Dockerfiles, deploy them to a Fly account and measure how long they took to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fly allows you to create organizations, and you can set a budget limit for those organizations and issue a Fly API key that can only create or modify apps within that organization...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I created a dedicated organization for just this one investigation, set a $5 budget, issued an API key and set Claude Code loose on it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that particular case the results weren’t useful enough to describe in more detail, but this was the project where I first realized that “designing an agentic loop” was an important skill to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;When to design an agentic loop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not every problem responds well to this pattern of working. The thing to look out for here are problems with clear success criteria where finding a good solution is likely to involve (potentially slightly tedious) trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any time you find yourself thinking “ugh, I’m going to have to try a lot of variations here” is a strong signal that an agentic loop might be worth trying!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debugging: a test is failing and you need to investigate the root cause. Coding agents that can already run your tests can likely do this without any extra setup.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance optimization: this SQL query is too slow, would adding an index help? Have your agent benchmark the query and then add and drop indexes (in an isolated development environment!) to measure their impact.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upgrading dependencies: you’ve fallen behind on a bunch of dependency upgrades? If your test suite is solid an agentic loop can upgrade them all for you and make any minor updates needed to reflect breaking changes. Make sure a copy of the relevant release notes is available, or that the agent knows where to find them itself.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimizing container sizes: Docker container feeling uncomfortably large? Have your agent try different base images and iterate on the Dockerfile to try to shrink it, while keeping the tests passing.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common theme in all of these is automated tests. The value you can get from coding agents and other LLM coding tools is massively amplified by a good, cleanly passing test suite. Thankfully LLMs are great for accelerating the process of putting one of those together, if you don’t have one yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;This is still a very fresh area&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing agentic loops is a very new skill—Claude Code was first released in just February 2025!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that giving it a clear name can help us have productive conversations about it. There’s so much more to figure out about how to use these tools as effectively as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sora 2 is here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our latest video generation model is more physically accurate, realistic, and more controllable than prior systems. It also features synchronized dialogue and sound effects. Create with it in the new Sora app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re releasing Sora 2, our flagship video and audio generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Sora model from February 2024 was in many ways the GPT‑1 moment for video—the first time video generation started to seem like it was working, and simple behaviors like object permanence emerged from scaling up pre-training compute. Since then, the Sora team has been focused on training models with more advanced world simulation capabilities. We believe such systems will be critical for training AI models that deeply understand the physical world. A major milestone for this is mastering pre-training and post-training on large-scale video data, which are in their infancy compared to language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Sora 2, we are jumping straight to what we think may be the GPT‑3.5 moment for video. Sora 2 can do things that are exceptionally difficult—and in some instances outright impossible—for prior video generation models: Olympic gymnastics routines, backflips on a paddleboard that accurately model the dynamics of buoyancy and rigidity, and triple axels while a cat holds on for dear life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior video models are overoptimistic—they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt. For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard. Interestingly, “mistakes” the model makes frequently appear to be mistakes of the internal agent that Sora 2 is implicitly modeling; though still imperfect, it is better about obeying the laws of physics compared to prior systems. This is an extremely important capability for any useful world simulator—you must be able to model failure, not just success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model is also a big leap forward in controllability, able to follow intricate instructions spanning multiple shots while accurately persisting world state. It excels at realistic, cinematic, and anime styles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a general purpose video-audio generation system, it is capable of creating sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also directly inject elements of the real world into Sora 2. For example, by observing a video of one of our teammates, the model can insert them into any Sora-generated environment with an accurate portrayal of appearance and voice. This capability is very general, and works for any human, animal or object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model is far from perfect and makes plenty of mistakes, but it is validation that further scaling up neural networks on video data will bring us closer to simulating reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the road to general-purpose simulation and AI systems that can function in the physical world, we think people can have a lot of fun with the models we’re building along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first started playing with this “upload yourself” feature several months ago on the Sora team, and we all had a blast with it. It kind of felt like a natural evolution of communication—from text messages to emojis to voice notes to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So today, we’re launching a new social iOS app just called “Sora,” powered by Sora 2. Inside the app, you can create, remix each other’s generations, discover new videos in a customizable Sora feed, and bring yourself or your friends in via cameos. With cameos, you can drop yourself straight into any Sora scene with remarkable fidelity after a short one-time video-and-audio recording in the app to verify your identity and capture your likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, we launched the app internally to all of OpenAI. We’ve already heard from our colleagues that they’re making new friends at the company because of the feature. We think a social app built around this “cameos” feature is the best way to experience the magic of Sora 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concerns about doomscrolling, addiction, isolation, and RL-sloptimized feeds are top of mind—here is what we are doing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are giving users the tools and optionality to be in control of what they see on the feed. Using OpenAI's existing large language models, we have developed a new class of recommender algorithms that can be instructed through natural language. We also have built-in mechanisms to periodically poll users on their wellbeing and proactively give them the option to adjust their feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, we show you content heavily biased towards people you follow or interact with, and prioritize videos that the model thinks you’re most likely to use as inspiration for your own creations. We are not optimizing for time spent in feed, and we explicitly designed the app to maximize creation, not consumption. You can find more details in our Feed Philosophy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This app is made to be used with your friends. Overwhelming feedback from testers is that cameos are what make this feel different and fun to use—you have to try it to really get it, but it is a new and unique way to communicate with people. We’re rolling this out as an invite-based app to make sure you come in with your friends. At a time when all major platforms are moving away from the social graph, we think cameos will reinforce community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protecting the wellbeing of teens is important to us. We are putting in default limits on how many generations teens can see per day in the feed, and we’re also rolling out with stricter permissions on cameos for this group. In addition to our automated safety stacks, we are scaling up teams of human moderators to quickly review cases of bullying if they arise. We are launching with Sora parental controls via ChatGPT so parents can override infinite scroll limits, turn off algorithm personalization, as well as manage direct message settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With cameos, you are in control of your likeness end-to-end with Sora. Only you decide who can use your cameo, and you can revoke access or remove any video that includes it at any time. Videos containing cameos of you, including drafts created by other people, are viewable by you at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of safety topics we’ve tackled with this app—consent around use of likeness, provenance, preventing the generation of harmful content, and much more. See our Sora 2 Safety doc for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of problems with other apps stem from the monetization model incentivizing decisions that are at odds with user wellbeing. Transparently, our only current plan is to eventually give users the option to pay some amount to generate an extra video if there’s too much demand relative to available compute. As the app evolves, we will openly communicate any changes in our approach here, while continuing to keep user wellbeing as our main goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re at the beginning of this journey, but with all of the powerful ways to create and remix content with Sora 2, we see this as the beginning of a completely new era for co-creative experiences. We’re optimistic that this will be a healthier platform for entertainment and creativity compared to what is available right now. We hope you have a good time :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sora iOS app(opens in a new window) is available to download now. You can sign up in-app for a push notification when access opens for your account. We’re starting the initial rollout in the U.S. and Canada today with the intent to quickly expand to additional countries. After you’ve received an invite, you’ll also be able to access Sora 2 through sora.com(opens in a new window). Sora 2 will initially be available for free, with generous limits to start so people can freely explore its capabilities, though these are still subject to compute constraints. ChatGPT Pro users will also be able to use our experimental, higher quality Sora 2 Pro model on sora.com(opens in a new window) (and soon in the Sora app as well). We also plan to release Sora 2 in the API. Sora 1 Turbo will remain available, and everything you’ve created will continue to live in your sora.com(opens in a new window) library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video models are getting very good, very quickly. General-purpose world simulators and robotic agents will fundamentally reshape society and accelerate the arc of human progress. Sora 2 represents significant progress towards that goal. In keeping with OpenAI’s mission, it is important that humanity benefits from these models as they are developed. We think Sora is going to bring a lot of joy, creativity and connection to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation has long been known to double your risk of heart disease, but prior to now, inflammation has never been a SMuRF: standard modifiable risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The American College of Cardiology just released recommendations that change that. The ACC is now recommending that everyone measure inflammation (specifically, hs-CRP) via a blood test:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Because clinicians will not treat what they do not measure, universal screening of hsCRP in both primary and secondary prevention patients, in combination with cholesterol, represents a major clinical opportunity and is therefore recommended. American College of Cardiology&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were many interesting bits of evidence that led to this recommendation. The whole article, published in JACC, is worth a read, but this blog post extracts a few of the most interesting parts — or at least, the parts I thought were most interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Inflammation (hs-CRP) is a stronger predictor of heart disease than cholesterol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, LDL cholesterol (or ApoB) has been the main focus of cardiovascular risk assessment. But this chart shows hs-CRP is actually a stronger predictor of heart disease than LDL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? In some ways, cholesterol has become a victim of its own success. We now screen the whole population for high cholesterol, give statins to those with high LDL (or ApoB), and so then the majority of people who end up having heart attacks have lower cholesterol than they would naturally have. This means most of the majority of residual risk for heart attacks will be found in biomarkers that aren’t SMuRFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inflammation (hs-CRP) is one such non-SMuRF, one perhaps one of the strongest. This is especially true in people already on statins or those without traditional risk factors (sometimes called “SMuRF-less” patients). In these groups, cholesterol may be well controlled, but inflammation remains a key driver of events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, other traditional risk factors matter in addition to inflammation: blood pressure, HbA1c or insulin resistance, eGFR (kidney function), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What can you actually do to lower inflammation?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ACC consensus reviews a range of clinical trials testing both drugs and lifestyle interventions for lowering inflammation and reducing cardiovascular risk. Here’s a summary of the clinical trials and their results:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What works to lower inflammation?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Statins (especially in people with high hs-CRP): Substantial reduction in events, even when LDL is normal (JUPITER trial).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Colchicine: Reduces recurrent events in people with established heart disease (COLCOT, LoDoCo2).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Canakinumab: Reduces events but is expensive and increases infection risk (CANTOS).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lifestyle: Anti-inflammatory diets (Mediterranean, DASH), regular exercise, smoking cessation, and maintaining a healthy weight all lower hs-CRP and reduce risk.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What doesn’t work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some anti-inflammatory drugs (methotrexate, TNF inhibitors, corticosteroids) have not shown benefit in major trials.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s a normal, good, or bad hs-CRP?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve already measured your hs-CRP (great!), then it’s ideally below &amp;lt;1 mg/L. hs-CRP above 3 mg/L is high risk:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(If you’re in moderate or high ranges, see the section above for what to do.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Are other biomarkers of inflammation relevant?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ACC evaluated other markers: IL-6, fibrinogen, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, EPA/AA ratio, and serum amyloid A. These have also been shown to predict cardiovascular risk, but once hs-CRP is known, don’t add more signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, you’re best off simply measuring hs-CRP, and then spending money elsewhere on heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other interesting bits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JACC article is packed with other interesting insights. These ones were interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Imaging biomarkers (like CT, PET, MRI, and perivascular “fat attenuation index”) can detect vascular inflammation and may help predict coronary events, but are not yet ready for routine clinical use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bempedoic acid is a newer cholesterol-lowering drug that also lowers hs-CRP, but its long-term outcomes are still being studied.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Residual inflammatory risk: Even with well-controlled LDL on statins, many people still have elevated hs-CRP and ongoing risk—so inflammation should be addressed separately from cholesterol.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Universal hs-CRP screening is now recommended by the ACC for both people with and without established heart disease.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Colchicine (0.5 mg/d) is now FDA-approved as an adjunct for secondary prevention in stable ASCVD, but should be avoided in people with significant kidney or liver disease.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Novel IL-6 inhibitors are being studied as future anti-inflammatory therapies for heart disease.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to measure your inflammation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple blood test for hs-CRP is widely available and inexpensive. The ACC now recommends routine hs-CRP testing for both people at risk (primary prevention) and those with established heart disease (secondary prevention).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For software engineers, diffs are a ubiquitous method for representing changes: We use diffs to compare different versions of the same file (e.g., during code review or when trying to understand the history of a file), to visualize the difference of a failing test compared with its expectation, or to apply changes to source files automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every project I worked on professionally or privately eventually needed a diff to visualize a change or to apply a patch. However, I have never been satisfied with any of the freely available diff libraries. This was never really a problem professionally, but for private projects, I have copied and modified my own library from project to project until I mentioned this to a colleague who set me on the path to publish my Go library (a port of a previous C++ library I used to copy and modify). Boy, did I underestimate how close my library was to publishability!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I did it and I learned a whole lot about diff algorithms. You can find my library at znkr.io/diff and what I learned in this article. I am not finished learning yet, so I plan to update this article as my understanding continues to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Existing Diff Libraries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me start by explaining why I am dissatisfied with existing diff libraries. There are a number of attributes that are important to me. Not all of these attributes are important for every use case, but a diff library that I can use for all of my use cases needs to fulfill all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually, the input to a diff algorithm is text, and most diff libraries only support that. However, I occasionally have use cases where I need to compare things that are not text. So any diff library that only supports text doesn't meet my needs; instead, I need support for arbitrary sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting diff output is intended to be readable by humans. Quite often, especially for text, a good way to present a diff is in the unified format. However, it's not always the best presentation. A diff library should make it easy to output a diff in unified format, but it should also provide a way to customize the presentation by providing a structured result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides the presentation, the content of a diff should make it easy for humans to understand the diff. This is a somewhat subjective criterion, but there are a number of failure cases that are easily avoided, and there's some research into diff readability to set a benchmark. On the other hand, diffs should be minimal in that they should be as small as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last but not least, it's important that a diff library has a simple API and provides good performance in both runtime and memory usage, even in worst-case scenarios1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that, we can evaluate existing diff libraries. For Go, I went through a number of libraries and summarized them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Name&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Output&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;API&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Performance2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Diff&lt;p&gt;Readability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;➖&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;❌3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;godebug&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➖➖➖ /🧨7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;mb0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😐8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➖➖&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;udiff&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕9&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➖&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➖➖9&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way I assigned ➕ and ➖ in this table doesn't follow any scientific methodology it's merely based on running a few benchmarks and comparing a few results by hand. If you're looking for a diff library to fulfill your needs, I would like to encourage you to do your own comparisons. You can find the code I used for these comparisons in on github.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results suggest that it's far from trivial to implement a good diff library, and the one I had started out with wasn't much better. To understand why the existing libraries are as they are, we need to take a peek into the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Complexity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the exception of go-internal, all libraries use Myers' Algorithm to compute the diff. This is a standard algorithm that returns a minimal diff and has been in use for this purpose for decades. The algorithm has a runtime complexity of where is the number of input elements and is the edit distance between the two inputs. This means that the algorithm is very fast for inputs that are similar, which is quite common. However, it's essentially quadratic in the worst case. That is, for inputs that are very different, the complexity approaches . Furthermore, the algorithm comes in two variants with a space complexity of either or . Only godebug uses the variant with quadratic memory growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that it's relatively easy to write a well-performing diffing algorithm for small or similar inputs, but it takes a very long time to complete for larger, less similar inputs. A consequence of this is that we can't trust simple benchmarks; instead, we need to test the worst-case scenario1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always in cases like this, we can improve the performance by approximating an optimal solution. There are a number of heuristics that reduce the time complexity by trading off diff minimality. For example, diffmatchpatch uses a deadline to stop the search for an optimal diff, and udiff uses a an extremely aggressive heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of improving Myers' runtime with heuristics, it's also often possible to find a diff using only heuristics. go-internal uses patience diff. The heuristic is good enough that it alone almost always results in a good diff with a runtime complexity of 10. An additional advantage of this algorithm is that it produces more readable diffs. However, patience diff can fail with very large diffs, and it can only be implemented efficiently using a hash table, which restricts the possible applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Histogram Diff&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides patience diff, there's another interesting heuristic called histogram diff. I still have to implement it and understand it better before writing about it here, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Readability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diff algorithms usually find a minimal diff or an approximation of one. However, except for trivial cases, there are always multiple minimal diffs. For example, this simple diff&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;a
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;b
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;c
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;d
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is as minimal as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we relax minimality to accept approximations, the number of possible results increases significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For good diff readability, we have to select one solution from the many possible ones that is readable for humans. Many people believe that the diff readability is determined by the algorithm. However, that's only partially correct, because different implementations of the same algorithm can produce vastly different results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also been a lot of progress in the past years to improve diff readability. Perhaps the best work about diff readability is diff-slider-tools by Michael Haggerty. He implemented a heuristic that's applied in a post-processing step to improve the readability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;code&gt;example_03.diff&lt;/code&gt; above was generated using this heuristic. The diff without the heuristic,
as generated by my implementation of Myers' linear-space variant, looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;

          &lt;code&gt;int Chunk_bounds_check(Chunk *chunk, size_t start, size_t n)

        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;}

        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that the deletion starts at the end of the preceding function and leaves a small remainder of the function being deleted? Michael's heuristic fixes this problem and results in the very readable &lt;code&gt;example_03.diff&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not the algorithm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;example_04.diff&lt;/code&gt; was found using a different implementation of Myers'
linear-space variant. That is, both &lt;code&gt;example_03.diff&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;example_04.diff&lt;/code&gt; used the same algorithm!
The differences stem from the implementation of that algorithm and from post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A New Diffing Library for Go&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created znkr.io/diff to address these challenges in a way that works for all my use cases. Let's reiterate what I want from a diffing library:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The input can be text and arbitrary slices&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The output should be possible in unified format and as a structured result&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The API should be simple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The diffs should be minimal or near-minimal&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The runtime and memory performance should be excellent&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a lot more than what any of the existing libraries provide. When I copied and modified my old diffing library, I could adapt it to the use cases at hand. But a general-purpose diffing library needs to be general enough to cover the vast majority of use cases. At the same time, it needs to be extensible to make sure new features can be implemented without cluttering the API over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, excellent performance and minimal results are somewhat in opposition to one another and I ended up providing three different modes of operation: Default (balanced between performance and minimality), Fast (sacrifice minimal results for faster speed), Optimal (minimal result whatever the cost).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mode&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Input&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Output&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;API&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Performance2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Diff&lt;p&gt;Readability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Diff&lt;p&gt;Minimality2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Default&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fast&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Optimal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text Only&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This table only applies to text (same as the table above), non-text inputs can have a different performance (if they are not &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt;) or readability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To design this API, I started with the data structures that I wanted to use as a user of the API and worked backwards from there. At a very high level, there are two structured representations of a diff that have been useful to me: a flat sequence of all deletions, insertions, and matching elements (called edits) and a nested sequence of consecutive changes (called hunks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edits are what I use to represent edits in this article; they contain the full content of both inputs and how one is transformed into the other.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hunks are a great representation for unit tests, because they are empty if both inputs are identical and they make it possible to visualize just the changes even if the inputs are large.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Arbitrary Slices&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started with the design for the most general case, arbitrary slices. The Go representation for diffing slices I liked the most is this one (see also znkr.io/diff):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Op describes an edit operation.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;type Op int
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;const (
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Match  Op = iota // Two slice elements match
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Delete           // A deletion from an element on the left slice
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;21&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;}

      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;23&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Hunk describes a sequence of consecutive edits.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;24&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;type Hunk[T any] struct {
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;25&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	PosX, EndX int       // Start and end position in x.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;26&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	PosY, EndY int       // Start and end position in y.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;27&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Edits      []Edit[T] // Edits to transform x[PosX:EndX] to y[PosY:EndY]
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;28&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;}
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternatives I have seen are variations and combinations of two themes. Either using slices to represent edit operations in &lt;code&gt;Hunk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type Hunk[T any] struct {
	Delete []T
	Insert []T
	Match  []T
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or using indices instead of elements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type Edit struct {
	Op         Op
	PosX, PosY []int
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these representations work, but I found that the representations above served my use cases best. One little quirk is that &lt;code&gt;Edit&lt;/code&gt; always contains both elements. This is often unnecessary, but
there are use cases where this is very important because the elements themselves might not be equal
(e.g., if they are pointers that are compared with a custom function).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the data structures were established, it was quite obvious that the simplest way to fill them with diff data was to write two functions &lt;code&gt;diff.Edits&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;diff.Hunks&lt;/code&gt; to return the diffs. I made them extensible by
using functional options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;30&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Edits compares the contents of x and y and returns the changes necessary to convert from one to
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;31&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// the other.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;32&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;//
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;33&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Edits returns one edit for every element in the input slices. If x and y are identical, the

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;34&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// output will consist of a match edit for every input element.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;35&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;func Edits[T comparable](x, y []T, opts ...Option) []Edit[T]

        &lt;cell&gt;40&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// The output is a sequence of hunks. A hunk represents a contiguous block of changes (insertions
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;41&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// and deletions) along with some surrounding context.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;42&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;func Hunks[T comparable](x, y []T, opts ...Option) []Hunk[T]
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The options allow for future extensibility and allow changing the behavior of these functions. For example, the option &lt;code&gt;diff.Context(5)&lt;/code&gt; configures &lt;code&gt;Hunks&lt;/code&gt;
to provide 5 elements of surrounding context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the current API still doesn't allow arbitrary slices; it only allows slices of &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types. To fix this, I needed two other functions that provide a function to compare
two elements. The Go standard library uses the &lt;code&gt;Func&lt;/code&gt; suffix for functions like this, so I followed
the lead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;44&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// EditsFunc compares the contents of x and y using the provided equality comparison and returns the
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;45&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// changes necessary to convert from one to the other.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;46&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;func EditsFunc[T any](x, y []T, eq func(a, b T) bool, opts ...Option) []Edit[T]
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;47&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;48&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// HunksFunc compares the contents of x and y using the provided equality comparison and returns the
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;49&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// changes necessary to convert from one to the other.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;50&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;func HunksFunc[T any](x, y []T, eq func(a, b T) bool, opts ...Option) []Hunk[T]
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Text&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this API works well to produce a structured result for arbitrary slices, it doesn't provide output in unified format for text inputs. My first approach was to provide a helper function that returns a diff in unified format: &lt;code&gt;diff.ToUnified(hunks []Hunk[string]) string&lt;/code&gt;. However, this would
make getting a unified diff more complicated. Besides requiring two function calls, it would be
necessary to split the input into lines. This, in turn, can be done in different ways, e.g., by
stripping or keeping the line breaks, which opens the door to mistakes. It's much better to provide
a simple function for the entire use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Unified compares the lines in x and y and returns the changes necessary to convert from one to
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// the other in unified format.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;func Unified[T string | []byte](x, y T, opts ...diff.Option) T
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also moved this function to the &lt;code&gt;textdiff&lt;/code&gt; package to
highlight the difference in expected input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I also happen to have use cases where I need structured results for text diffs. It would be very annoying if I had to split those into lines manually. Besides, I can make a few more assumptions about text that allow for a slight simplification of the data structures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Edit describes a single edit of a line-by-line diff.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;type Edit[T string | []byte] struct {
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Op   diff.Op // Edit operation
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the full API and examples for how to use it, please see the package documentation for znkr.io/diff and znkr.io/diff/textdiff. I am certain that there are use cases not covered by this API, but I feel confident that it can evolve to cover these use cases in the future. For now, all my needs are fulfilled, but if you run into a situation that can't be solved by this API or requires some contortions, please tell me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To implement this API, we need to implement a diff algorithm. There are a couple of standard diff algorithms that we can choose from. The choice of the algorithm as well as how it's implemented matters for the readability of the result as well as the performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good starting point for this project was Myers' algorithm, simply because it's the fastest algorithm that can cover the whole API. In particular, the &lt;code&gt;...Func&lt;/code&gt; variants for &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; types
instead of &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; can't make use of a hash map. Patience and Histogram require the use of a
hash map for an efficient implementation, so Myers' really is the only choice. Another advantage of
Myers' compared to Patience and Histogram is that it will return optimal results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the flip side, in the comparison above, it came out as relatively slow compared to the patience diff algorithm and didn't produce the most readable results. It turns out, however, that this can be mitigated and almost completely overcome for &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types using
a combination of preprocessing, heuristics, and post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not going to cover the diff algorithm in detail here. There are a number of excellent articles on the web that describe it12, but I recommend reading the paper13: All articles I have seen try to keep a distance from the theory that makes this algorithm work, but that's not really helpful if you want to understand how and why this algorithm works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Preprocessing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most impactful way to improve the performance of Myers' algorithm is to reduce the problem size. The simplest thing to do is to strip any common prefix and suffix. This is always possible and helps a little. However, it can also reduce diff readability, because it will consume matching elements eagerly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, let's say we have this change:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;package array
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;var m = []struct{
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If we eagerly consume the common prefix first and then the common suffix, the first 11 lines are all identical and the so are the last 4. This in turn would result in a different diff:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;18&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    },
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;19&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this is easy to fix in post processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much more impactful, but only efficiently possible for &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types, is to remove all elements
that are unique to either the left side or the right side, as those must always be deletions or
insertions. Non-&lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types can't be keys in a hash map in Go, which is necessary for
checking uniqueness. This preprocessing step reduced the runtime by up to
99% for a few
real-world worst-case diffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast to the suffix and prefix removal, stripping unique elements doesn't have any readability impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Heuristics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another very impactful way to improve the performance is Anchoring. It is based on patience diff. The word patience is a bit misleading, because it's too easily associated with having to wait and it doesn't describe the heuristic very well either. It works by finding elements that are occur exactly once on both the left and the right side. When we matching up these unique pairs we create a segmentation of the input into smaller parts that can be analyzed individually. Even better, we're very likely to find matching lines atop and below such a pair of unique elements. This allows us to shrink the segments by stripping common prefixes and suffixes. This heuristic reduced the runtime by up to 95%. Unfortunately, finding unique elements and matching them up requires a hash map again which means that it can only be used for &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two more heuristics that are I implemented. They help for non-&lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types and as a
backstop when the other heuristics don't work. Their main purpose is to avoid runaway quadratic
growth. The Good Diagonal heuristic stops searching for a better solution if we found a solution
that's good enough and the Too Expensive heuristic shortcuts the search if it becomes too
expensive which reduces the worst-case complexity from 

 to


.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, heuristics like this trade diff minimality for performance, this is not always desirable. Sometimes, a minimal diff is exactly what's required. &lt;code&gt;diff.Optimal&lt;/code&gt; disables these heuristics to always find a
minimal diff irrespective of the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Post-processing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We established before that a diff algorithm finds one of many possible solutions. Given such a solution we can discover more solutions by it locally and then selecting the best solution according to some metric. This is exactly how Michael Haggerty's indentation heuristic works for text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For any given diff, we can often slide the edits up or down in a way that doesn't change the meaning of a diff. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;["foo", "bar", "baz"].map do |i|
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;  i
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;end
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;["foo", "bar", "baz"].map do |i|
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;  i.upcase
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;end
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;has the same meaning as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;["foo", "bar", "baz"].map do |i|
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;  i
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;end
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;["foo", "bar", "baz"].map do |i|
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;  i.upcase
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We call edits that can be slid up or down sliders. The question is, how do we select the best slide? Michael collected human ratings for different sliders of the same diff and used them to develop a heuristic to match these ratings: diff-slider-tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this heuristic only works for text and is tuned towards code instead of prose. I decided to make it optional. It can be enabled with the &lt;code&gt;textdiff.IndentHeuristic&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Diff Representation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The representation used during the execution of the diff algorithm has a surprising impact on the algorithm performance and result readability. This is not at all obvious, and so it took me a while to figure out that the best approach is akin to a side-by-side view of a diff: You use two &lt;code&gt;[]bool&lt;/code&gt;
slices to represent the left side and the right side respectively: &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in the left side slice
represents a deletion and on the right side an insertion. &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; is a matching element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This representation has four big advantages: It can be preallocated, the order in which edits are discovered doesn't matter, it's easy to mutate during post-processing, and it's easy to generate other representations from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Open Questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What exactly is the reason that two different algorithms produce different results? - I looked into this question a little, but I haven't found a conclusive answer yet.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diff algorithms are relatively complicated by themselves, but they pale in comparison to what's necessary to provide a high-quality diff library. This article tries to explain what went into my new diff library, but there's still more that I haven't implemented yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here is one real-world example of why worst-case scenarios are important: Imagine you're breaking an existing feature in a way that triggers a worst-case scenario in a test. If the test is running for a very long time or runs out of memory, you're going to have to debug two problems instead of one. ↩︎ ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See benchmark_comparison.txt for the source of these ratings. ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The diffmatchpatch API is very hard to use ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No support for structured results ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Quadratic memory use; for my test cases, this resulted in &amp;gt;30 GB of memory used. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The mb0 API is from before generics and is a bit cumbersome to use ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;udiff has a very low threshold for when it starts to stop searching for an optimal solution. This improves the speed, but it also results in relatively large diffs. ↩︎ ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There's no single patience diff heuristic, instead there are different implementations with different performance characteristics. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mind the encryptionroot: How to save your data when ZFS loses its mind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While ZFS has a well-earned reputation for data integrity and reliability, OpenZFS native encryption has some incredibly sharp edges that will cut you if you don't know where to be careful. Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way, standing in a pool of my own blood and tears after thoroughly lacerating myself. I very nearly permanently lost 8.5 TiB of data after performing what should've been a series of simple, routine ZFS operations but resulted in an undecryptable dataset. Time has healed the wound enough that I am no longer filled with anguish just thinking about it, so I will now share my experience in the hope that you may learn from my mistakes. Together, we'll go over the unfortunate series of events that led to this happening and how it could've been avoided, learn how ZFS actually works under the hood, use our newfound knowledge to debug and reproduce the issue at hand, and finally compile a modified version of ZFS to repair the corrupted state and rescue our precious data. This is the postmortem of that terrible, horrible, no good, very bad weekâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The issue covered in this postmortem only applies to OpenZFS native encryption. Oracle ZFS has its own encryption scheme which is different and, as far as I can tell, should not be vulnerable to this particular failure mode, though I have not personally tested it. Thank you to u/HobartTasmania for pointing this out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1: An unfortunate series of events&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The status quo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In the beginning, there were two ZFS pools: &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; (names changed for clarity). Each pool was hosted on an instance of TrueNAS CORE 13.0-U5.1 located at two different sites about an hour's drive apart with poor Internet connectivity between them. For this reason, a third pool &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; was periodically moved between the two sites and used to exchange snapshots of &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; datasets for backup purposes. ZFS dataset snapshots would be indirectly relayed from &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; (and vice versa) using &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; as an intermediate ZFS send/recv source/destination (e.g. &lt;code&gt;old/foo@2023-06-01&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old/foo@2023-06-01&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;new/old/foo@2023-06-01&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; pool was natively encrypted from the very beginning. When ZFS snapshots were sent from &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/new&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;old/new&lt;/code&gt;, they were sent raw, meaning that blocks were copied unmodified in their encrypted form. To decrypt and mount them on &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt;, you would need to first load &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;'s hex encryption key, which is stored in TrueNAS's SQLite database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; pool, on the other hand, was created before the advent of native encryption and was unencrypted for the first part of its life. Because it's desirable to encrypt data at rest, an encrypted dataset &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; was created for &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; using a passphrase encryption key when &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; was set up. Unencrypted snapshots were sent non-raw from &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, where they were encrypted, and then sent raw from &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;new/old&lt;/code&gt;. To decrypt and mount them on &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, you would need to first load &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt;'s passphrase encryption key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was all tested thoroughly and snapshots were proven to be readable at each point on every pool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Encrypting the old pool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Now that we had encrypted snapshots of &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, we wanted to encrypt &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; itself. To do this, I simply took &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; offline during a maintenance window to prevent new writes, took snapshots of all datasets, sent them to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, and then sent the raw encrypted snapshots from &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; back to &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt;. Once I verified each dataset had been encrypted successfully, I destroyed the unencrypted dataset, updated the mount point of the encrypted dataset to that of the late unencrypted dataset, and then moved on to the next dataset. After all datasets were migrated, I used &lt;code&gt;zfs change-key -i&lt;/code&gt; to make all child datasets inherit from the new &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; encryption root, and then changed the key of the encryption root from a passphrase to a hex key, since TrueNAS only supported automatically unlocking datasets with hex encryption keys. Finally, I issued a &lt;code&gt;zpool initialize&lt;/code&gt; to overwrite all the unencrypted blocks which were now in unallocated space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Spoiler Alert: It may not be immediately obvious why, but changing the encryption key on &lt;code&gt;old/encryption&lt;/code&gt; silently broke backups of &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; datasets. Snapshots would still send and recv successfully, but were no longer decryptable or mountable. Since the encryption key is not normally loaded, and we only load it when periodically testing the backups, we would not realize until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lesson: Test backups continuously so you get immediate feedback when they break.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Decommissioning the old pool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Later, the &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; pool was moved to the same site as the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; pool, so we wanted to fully decommission &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; and migrate all its datasets to &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;. I began going about this in a similar way. I took &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; offline to prevent new writes, sent snapshots to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, and then to &lt;code&gt;new/old&lt;/code&gt;. It was at this point that I made a very unfortunate mistake: I accidentally destroyed one dataset &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted/foo&lt;/code&gt; before verifying the files were readable on &lt;code&gt;new/old/foo&lt;/code&gt;, and I would soon realize that they were not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lesson: Wait to make all destructive changes together at the very end instead of interspersed where they could accidentally be performed in the wrong order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The realization&lt;/head&gt;

cannot mount 'new/old/foo': Permission denied&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you mean, permission denied? I am root!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Crap, I already destroyed &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted/foo&lt;/code&gt;. This is not good, but I can still restore it from the remaining copy on &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old/foo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[sam@newnas ~]$ sudo zfs load-key sneakernet/old
Enter passphrase for 'sneakernet/old':
[sam@newnas ~]$ sudo zfs mount sneakernet/old/foo

    &lt;p&gt; Oh no, &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; is broken too. This is very not good!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an act of desperation, I tried rebooting the machine, but it didn't change a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is at this point that I realized:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Something has gone terribly wrong to prevent datasets on both &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;new/old&lt;/code&gt;from mounting.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whatever it is, it's not likely going to be easy to diagnose or fix.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There's a very real possibility the data might be gone forever.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found myself in a hole and I wanted to stop digging. Fortunately, uptime was no longer critical for the &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; datasets after the relocation, so I could afford to step away from the keyboard, collect my thoughts, and avoid making the situation any worse that it already was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 2: Debugging the issue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the worst of the overwhelming, visceral feelings that come with the realization that you may have just caused permanent data loss had subsided, I started to work the incident and try to figure out why the backups aren't mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; As a precaution, I first exported the &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; pool and took a forensic image of every disk in the pool. ZFS is a copy-on-write filesystem, so even though the dataset had been destroyed, most of the data was probably still on disk, just completely inaccessible with the normal ZFS tooling. In the worst case scenario, I may have had to try to forensically reconstruct the dataset from what was left on disk, and I didn't want to risk causing any more damage than I already had. Fortunately, I never had to use the disk images, but they still served as a valuable safety net while debugging and repairing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I realized that if we are to have any chance of debugging and fixing this issue, I need to learn how ZFS actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Learning how ZFS actually works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I unfortunately did not keep track of every resource I consumed, but in addition to reading the source and docs, I found these talks by Jeff Bonwick, Bill Moore, and Matt Ahrens (the original creators of ZFS) to be particularly helpful in understanding the design and implementation of ZFS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems Part 1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems Part 2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems Part 3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How ZFS Snapshots Really Work&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I highly recommend watching them all despite their age and somewhat poor recording quality, but will summarize the relevant information for those who don't have 3 hours to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZFS is a copy-on-write filesystem, which means that it does not overwrite blocks in place when a write is requested. Instead, the updated contents are written to a newly allocated block, and the old block is freed, which keeps the filesystem consistent if a write is interrupted. All blocks of both data and metadata are arranged in a Merkle tree structure where each block pointer contains a checksum of the child block, which allows ZFS to detect both block corruption and misdirected/phantom reads/writes. This means that any write will cause the block's checksum to change, which will then cause the parent block's checksum to change (since the parent block includes the block pointer which includes checksum of the child block that changed), and so on, all the way up to the root of the tree which ZFS calls an uberblock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uberblocks are written atomically, and because of the Merkle tree structure, they always represent a consistent snapshot of the entire filesystem at a point in time. Writes are batched together into transaction groups identified by a monotonically increasing counter, and each transaction group when synced to disk produces a new uberblock and associated filesystem tree. Taking a snapshot is then as simple as saving an uberblock and not freeing any of the blocks it points to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the checksum, each block pointer also contains the transaction group id in which the child block was written, which is called the block's birth time or creation time. ZFS uses birth times to determine which blocks have been written before or after a snapshot. Any blocks with a birth time less than or equal to the snapshot's birth time, must have been written before the snapshot was taken, and conversely, any blocks with a birth time greater than the snapshot's birth time must have been written after the snapshot was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One application of birth times is to generate incremental send streams between two snapshots. ZFS walks the tree but only needs to include blocks where the birth time is both greater than the first snapshot and less than or equal to the second snapshot. In fact, you don't even need to keep the data of the first snapshot aroundâyou can create a bookmark which saves the snapshot's transaction id (but none of the data blocks), delete the snapshot to free its data, and then use the bookmark as the source to generate the same incremental send stream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler Alert: Chekhov's bookmark will become relevant later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Learning how ZFS native encryption actually works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZFS native encryption is a relatively new feature, which was first released in OpenZFS 0.8.0 (2019) and subsequently made it into FreeBSD 13.0 (2021) when OpenZFS was adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the docs, I found this 2016 talk on ZFS Native Encryption by Tom Caputi (the original author of native encryption) to be helpful in understanding its design and implementation. Again, I will summarize the relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; ZFS native encryption works by encrypting dataset blocks with an symmetric authenticated encryption cipher suite (AES-256-GCM by default). To use native encryption, you must create a new dataset with &lt;code&gt;-o encryption=on&lt;/code&gt; which generates a unique master key for the dataset. The dataset's master key is then used to derive block data encryption keys with a salted HKDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The master key can't be changed, so it is encrypted with a wrapping key which can be changed. The wrapping key is provided by the user with &lt;code&gt;zfs load-key&lt;/code&gt; and can be changed with &lt;code&gt;zfs change-key&lt;/code&gt; which re-encrypts the same master key with a new wrapping key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The encrypted master keys are stored in each dataset since each dataset has its own master key, but the wrapping key parameters are stored on what is called the encryption root dataset. The encryption root may be the same encrypted dataset, or it may be a parent of the encrypted dataset. When a child encrypted dataset inherits from a parent encryption root, the encryption root's wrapping key is used to decrypt the child dataset's master key. This is how one key can be used to unlock a parent encryption root dataset and all child encrypted datasets that inherit from it at the same time instead of having to load a key for every single encrypted dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In our case, &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/new&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; are the encryption roots, and all child encrypted datasets inherit from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Forming a hypothesis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, we now know enough to form a hypothesis as to what may have happened. Feel free to pause here and try to figure it out on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Recall that &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; was created using a passphrase encryption key, and &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; was created by raw sending &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, so it initially used the same passphrase derived wrapping encryption key. When the &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; encryption key was changed from a passphrase to a hex key, ZFS must have changed the wrapping key parameters on the &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; encryption root and re-encrypted all child encrypted dataset master keys with the new hex wrapping key. Crucially, a new snapshot of &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; was never taken and sent to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; because it ostensibly didn't contain any data and was just a container for the child datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Hypothesis: When subsequent snapshots were sent from &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt;, the master keys of the child encrypted datasets were updated to be encrypted with the new hex wrapping key, but the &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; encryption root was never updated with the new hex wrapping key parameters because a new snapshot was never sent. Therefore, when we load the key for &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, ZFS asks for the old passphrase, not a hex key, and when we try to mount &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old/foo&lt;/code&gt;, it tries and fails to decrypt its master key with the old passphrase wrapping key instead of the new hex wrapping key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If correct, this would explain the behavior we're seeing. To test this hypothesis, let's try to reproduce the issue in a test environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Creating a test environment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TrueNAS CORE 13.0-U5.1 is based on FreeBSD 13.1, despite the different minor version numbers, so we'll create a FreeBSD 13.1 VM to test in. Make sure to include the system source tree and install on UFS so that we can build OpenZFS and reload the ZFS kernel module without rebooting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TrueNAS CORE 13.0-U5.1 uses ZFS 2.1.11, so we'll want to build the same version from source for consistency. I started by reading the Building ZFS guide and following the steps documented there with some small modifications for FreeBSD since the page was clearly written with Linux in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, install the dependencies we'll need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo pkg install autoconf automake autotools git gmake python devel/py-sysctl sudo&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, clone ZFS and check out tag zfs-2.1.11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~ $ git clone https://github.com/openzfs/zfs

    Signed-off-by: Tony Hutter &amp;lt;hutter2@llnl.gov&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, configure, build, and install ZFS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ sh autogen.sh
sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ ./configure
sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ gmake -s -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)    # &amp;lt;-- modified for FreeBSD
sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ sudo gmake install; sudo ldconfig  # &amp;lt;-- modified for FreeBSD&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, replace the FreeBSD's ZFS kernel module with the one we just built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ sudo kldunload zfs.ko  # Needed because zfs.sh only unloads openzfs.ko
sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ sudo ./scripts/zfs.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, verify we're running version 2.1.11 as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ sudo zfs version

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reproducing the issue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we're ready to try reproducing the issue. This took some iteration to get right, so I wrote a bash script that starts from scratch on each invocation and then runs the commands needed to reproduce the corrupt state. After quite a bit of trial and error, I eventually produced a reproducer script which does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create 2 pools: &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;using a passphrase encryption key.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;which inherits&lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;as its encryption root.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create files and take snapshots &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot@111&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot/child@111&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send raw snapshots &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot@111&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot/child@111&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;respectively.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Load encryption key for &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;using passphrase and mount encrypted datasets&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;. At this point,&lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst&lt;/code&gt;pools are in sync.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change the &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;encryption key from passphrase to hex.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update files and take snapshots &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot@222&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot/child@222&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send a raw incremental snapshot of &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot/child@222&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;, but do not send&lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot@222&lt;/code&gt;which contains the key change!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unmount &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;and unload the cached encryption key for&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Load the encryption key for &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;using the passphrase since we didn't send the updated encryption root after changing the key.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try to remount &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we run the reproducer, the root encrypted dataset &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt; mounts successfully and we can read the old file from the first snapshot, but the child encrypted dataset &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt; fails to mount with &lt;code&gt;cannot mount 'dst/encryptionroot/child: Permission denied&lt;/code&gt; just as we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo ./reproduce &amp;gt; /dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zfs mount dst/encryptionroot/child
cannot mount 'dst/encryptionroot/child': Permission denied&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, this isn't enough to fix &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt;; there are no remaining snapshots or bookmarks left on the &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; encryption root from before the key change, and we can't generate an incremental send stream without one. Mapped to our reproduced example, this means that &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot@111&lt;/code&gt; does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; You might think we could forcibly send the entire encryption root, but &lt;code&gt;zfs recv&lt;/code&gt; will reject it no matter what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zfs send --raw src/encryptionroot@222 | sudo zfs recv dst/encryptionroot
cannot receive new filesystem stream: destination 'dst/encryptionroot' exists
must specify -F to overwrite it

sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zfs send --raw src/encryptionroot@222 | sudo zfs recv -F dst/encryptionroot
cannot receive new filesystem stream: destination has snapshots (eg. dst/encryptionroot@111)
must destroy them to overwrite it

sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zfs destroy dst/encryptionroot@111
sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zfs send --raw src/encryptionroot@222 | sudo zfs recv -F dst/encryptionroot
cannot receive new filesystem stream: zfs receive -F cannot be used to destroy an encrypted filesystem or overwrite an unencrypted one with an encrypted one&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lesson: Create bookmarks before destroying snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to find a way to create an incremental send stream that contains the key change, but how?. We could try to manually craft a send stream containing the new key, but that sounds tricky. There's got to be a better way!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Idea for a hack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recall that a snapshot is not the only valid source for generating an incremental send stream. What if we had a bookmark?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; A bookmark works just as well as a snapshot for generating an incremental send stream, but we don't have a bookmark on &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; either. How is this any better?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike a snapshot, which is effectively an entire dataset tree frozen in time (very complex), a bookmark is a very simple object on disk which consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The GUID of the snapshot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The transaction group the snapshot was created in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Unix timestamp when the snapshot was created.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, this is what our bookmark looks like in &lt;code&gt;zdb&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zdb src/encryptionroot#111
	#111: {guid: 44e5e7755d23c673 creation_txg: 12 creation_time: 1756699200 redaction_obj: 0}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Note that &lt;code&gt;zdb&lt;/code&gt; shows the GUID in hexadecimal versus &lt;code&gt;zfs get guid&lt;/code&gt; which shows it in decimal, consistency be damned. The &lt;code&gt;redaction_obj&lt;/code&gt; is optional and only used for redaction bookmarks, so we can ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bookmark is simple enough that we could feasibly hack ZFS into manually writing one for us, provided that we can figure out the right values to use. The GUID and Unix timestamp don't really matter for generating an incremental send stream, so we could choose them arbitrarily if we had to, but the transaction group id really matters because that is what ZFS uses to determine which blocks to include.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But how can we figure out what transaction group the snapshot was created in if neither the snapshot nor a bookmark of the snapshot still exist? I initially considered walking the dataset trees on each pool, diffing them to find the newest block present on both datasets, and using its transaction group id, but I found a much easier way with one of ZFS's lesser known features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A brief detour into pool histories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't know about pool histories before embarking on this unplanned journey, but they are now yet another thing I love about ZFS. Every pool allocates 0.1% of its space (128 KiB minimum, 1 GiB maximum) to a ring buffer which is used to log every command that is executed on the pool. This can be used to forensically reconstruct the state of the pool over time.&lt;/p&gt;

For snapshots, this includes the transaction group (txg) id when the snapshot was created, which is exactly what we're looking for!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now that we know everything we need to create the bookmark, we just need to figure out a way to manually create a bookmark with arbitrary data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hacking ZFS to manually create a bookmark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; To understand how ZFS creates a bookmark, we can trace the code path from &lt;code&gt;zfs bookmark&lt;/code&gt; all the way down to &lt;code&gt;dsl_bookmark_add&lt;/code&gt; which actually adds the bookmark node to the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;command_table&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;zfs_do_bookmark&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lzc_bookmark&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lzc_ioctl&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;zfs_ioctl_fd&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;zcmd_ioctl_compat&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;zfs_ioctl_register bookmark&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;zfs_ioc_bookmark&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dsl_bookmark_create&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dsl_bookmark_create_sync&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dsl_bookmark_create_sync_impl_book&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dsl_bookmark_node_add&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the bookmark structure physically written to disk:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;zfs/include/sys/dsl_bookmark.h&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/*

#define	BOOKMARK_PHYS_SIZE_V1	(3 * sizeof (uint64_t))
#define	BOOKMARK_PHYS_SIZE_V2	(12 * sizeof (uint64_t))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Only the first 3 fields are required for v1 bookmarks, while v2 bookmarks contain all 12 fields. &lt;code&gt;dsl_bookmark_node_add&lt;/code&gt; only writes a v2 bookmark if one of the 9 v2 fields are non-zero, so we can leave them all zero to write a v1 bookmark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; After a few iterations, I had a patch which hijacks the normal &lt;code&gt;zfs bookmark pool/dataset#src pool/dataset#dst&lt;/code&gt; code path to create a bookmark with arbitrary data when the source bookmark name is &lt;code&gt;missing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The final obstacle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; ZFS refuses the stream because it is missing a source IV set GUID (see &lt;code&gt;from_ivset_guid = 0x0&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;zstreamdump&lt;/code&gt; above). This is because we created a v1 bookmark which does not contain the IV set GUID like a v2 bookmark would.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we know that the send stream is created using the right snapshots, we can temporarily disable checking IV set GUIDs to allow the snapshot to be received as described in errata 4.&lt;/p&gt;

All we need to do now is use our hacked ZFS build to create the bookmark on &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt;, send an incremental snapshot of the encryption root with the new key to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt;, and then send that snapshot from &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;. I rebuilt ZFS again with the correct transaction group, GUID, and creation timestamp for &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt;, repeated the same steps with the names changed, and thanks to our thorough testing, it worked on the first try!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a week of intense research and debugging, I had rescued our data back from the brink and could again sleep soundly at night. While I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about ZFS, I can't help but think about how this entire incident could have been avoided at several key points which translate directly into lessons learned:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test backups continuously so you get immediate feedback when they break.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wait to make all destructive changes together at the very end instead of interspersed where they could accidentally be performed in the wrong order.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Always send a snapshot of the encryption root after changing the encryption key.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create bookmarks before destroying snapshots.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope that you may learn from my mistakes and avoid a similar incident. If you do happen to find yourself in a similar predicament, I'd love to hear from you regardless of whether this postmortem was helpful or not. My contact details can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing what I now know about ZFS native encryption, I find it difficult to recommend until the sharp edges have all been filed down. In most cases, I'd prefer to encrypt the entire pool at the block device level and encrypt send streams with age. But if you really do need the flexibility offered by native encryption, always remember to mind the encryptionroot!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

An enormous body of work has accumulated over the years, covered in several books and surveys. This book provides a more introductory, textbook-like treatment of the subject. Each chapter tackles a particular line of work, providing a self-contained, teachable technical introduction and a brief review of the further developments; many of the chapters conclude with exercises.&lt;lb/&gt;The book is structured as follows. The first four chapters are on IID rewards, from the basic model to impossibility results to Bayesian priors to Lipschitz rewards. The next three chapters cover adversarial rewards, from the full-feedback version to adversarial bandits to extensions with linear rewards and combinatorially structured actions. Chapter 8 is on contextual bandits, a middle ground between IID and adversarial bandits in which the change in reward distributions is completely explained by observable contexts. The last three chapters cover connections to economics, from learning in repeated games to bandits with supply/budget constraints to exploration in the presence of incentives. The appendix provides sufficient background on concentration and KL-divergence.&lt;lb/&gt;The chapters on "bandits with similarity information", "bandits with knapsacks" and "bandits and agents" can also be consumed as standalone surveys on the respective topics.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Aleksandrs Slivkins [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Mon, 15 Apr 2019 18:17:01 UTC (510 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Mon, 29 Apr 2019 20:45:01 UTC (510 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v3] Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:39:03 UTC (536 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v4] Sun, 15 Sep 2019 02:06:22 UTC (557 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v5] Mon, 30 Sep 2019 00:15:42 UTC (543 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v6] Sat, 26 Jun 2021 20:15:32 UTC (639 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v7] Sat, 8 Jan 2022 20:05:40 UTC (627 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v8] Wed, 3 Apr 2024 21:32:42 UTC (629 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.LG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Born from the ashes of Stadia, this repository contains tools for syncing and streaming files from Windows to Windows or Linux. The tools are based on Content Defined Chunking (CDC), in particular FastCDC, to split up files into chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Stadia, game developers had access to Linux cloud instances to run games. Most developers wrote their games on Windows, though. Therefore, they needed a way to make them available on the remote Linux instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As developers had SSH access to those instances, they could use &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; to copy
the game content. However, this was impractical, especially with the shift to
working from home during the pandemic with sub-par internet connections. &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt;
always copies full files, there is no "delta mode" to copy only the things that
changed, it is slow for many small files, and there is no fast compression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help this situation, we developed two tools, &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt;,
which enable developers to quickly iterate on their games without repeatedly
incurring the cost of transmitting dozens of GBs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; is a tool to sync files from a Windows machine to a Linux device,
similar to the standard Linux rsync. It is
basically a copy tool, but optimized for the case where there is already an old
version of the files available in the target directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It quickly skips files if timestamp and file size match.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It uses fast compression for all data transfer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If a file changed, it determines which parts changed and only transfers the differences.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remote diffing algorithm is based on CDC. In our tests, it is up to 30x faster than the one used in &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; (1500 MB/s vs 50 MB/s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following chart shows a comparison of &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; and Linux &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; running
under Cygwin on Windows. The test data consists of 58 development builds
of some game provided to us for evaluation purposes. The builds are 40-45 GB
large. For this experiment, we uploaded the first build, then synced the second
build with each of the two tools and measured the time. For example, syncing
from build 1 to build 2 took 210 seconds with the Cygwin &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;, but only 75
seconds with &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt;. The three outliers are probably feature drops from
another development branch, where the delta was much higher. Overall,
&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; syncs files about 3 times faster than Cygwin &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also ran the experiment with the native Linux &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;, i.e syncing Linux to
Linux, to rule out issues with Cygwin. Linux &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; performed on average 35%
worse than Cygwin &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;, which can be attributed to CPU differences. We did
not include it in the figure because of this, but you can find it
here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard Linux &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; splits a file into fixed-size chunks of typically
several KB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the file is modified in the middle, e.g. by inserting &lt;code&gt;xxxx&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;567&lt;/code&gt;,
this usually means that the modified chunks as well as
all subsequent chunks change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; algorithm hashes the chunks of the remote "old" file
and sends the hashes to the local device. The local device then figures out
which parts of the "new" file matches known chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a simplification. The actual algorithm is more complicated and uses two hashes, a weak rolling hash and a strong hash, see here for a great overview. What makes &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; relatively slow is the "no match" situation where the rolling hash does
not match any remote hash, and the algorithm has to roll the hash forward and
perform a hash map lookup for each byte. &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; goes to
great lengths
optimizing lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; does not use fixed-size chunks, but instead variable-size,
content-defined chunks. That means, chunk boundaries are determined by the
local content of the file, in practice a 64 byte sliding window. For more
details, see
the FastCDC paper
or take a look at our implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the file is modified in the middle, only the modified chunks, but not subsequent chunks change (unless they are less than 64 bytes away from the modifications).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computing the chunk boundaries is cheap and involves only a left-shift, a memory lookup, an &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; operation for each input byte. This is cheaper
than the hash map lookup for the standard &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of this, the &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; algorithm is faster than the standard
&lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;. It is also simpler. Since chunk boundaries move along with insertions
or deletions, the task to match local and remote hashes is a trivial set
difference operation. It does not involve a per-byte hash map lookup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt; is a tool to stream files and directories from a Windows machine to
a Linux device. Conceptually, it is similar to
sshfs, but it is optimized for read speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It caches streamed data on the Linux device.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If a file is re-read on Linux after it changed on Windows, only the differences are streamed again. The rest is read from the cache.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stat operations are very fast since the directory metadata (filenames, permissions etc.) is provided in a streaming-friendly way.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To efficiently determine which parts of a file changed, the tool uses the same CDC-based diffing algorithm as &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt;. Changes to Windows files are almost
immediately reflected on Linux, with a delay of roughly (0.5s + 0.7s x total
size of changed files in GB).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tool does not support writing files back from Linux to Windows; the Linux directory is readonly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following chart compares times from starting a game to reaching the menu. In one case, the game is streamed via &lt;code&gt;sshfs&lt;/code&gt;, in the other case we use
&lt;code&gt;cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt;. Overall, we see a 2x to 5x speedup.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;1 Only local syncs, e.g. &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\src\* C:\dst&lt;/code&gt;. Support for
remote syncs is being added, see
#61.&lt;lb/&gt; 2 See #56.&lt;lb/&gt; 3 See #62.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the precompiled binaries from the latest release to a Windows device and unzip them. The Linux binaries are automatically deployed to &lt;code&gt;~/.cache/cdc-file-transfer&lt;/code&gt; by the Windows tools. There is no need to manually
deploy them. We currently provide Linux binaries compiled on
Github's latest Ubuntu version.
If the binaries work for you, you can skip the following two sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the project can be built from source. Some binaries have to be built on Windows, some on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build the tools from source, the following steps have to be executed on both Windows and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download and install Bazel from here. See workflow logs for the currently used version.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clone the repository. &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/google/cdc-file-transfer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Initialize submodules. &lt;code&gt;cd cdc-file-transfer git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, install an SSH client on the Windows machine if not present. The file transfer tools require &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sftp.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two tools CDC RSync and CDC Stream can be built and used independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On a Linux device, build the Linux components &lt;code&gt;bazel build --config linux --compilation_mode=opt --linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all --copt=-fdata-sections --copt=-ffunction-sections --linkopt=-Wl,--gc-sections //cdc_rsync_server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On a Windows device, build the Windows components &lt;code&gt;bazel build --config windows --compilation_mode=opt --copt=/GL //cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy the Linux build output file &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync_server&lt;/code&gt;from&lt;code&gt;bazel-bin/cdc_rsync_server&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;bazel-bin\cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt;on the Windows machine.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On a Linux device, build the Linux components &lt;code&gt;bazel build --config linux --compilation_mode=opt --linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all --copt=-fdata-sections --copt=-ffunction-sections --linkopt=-Wl,--gc-sections //cdc_fuse_fs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On a Windows device, build the Windows components &lt;code&gt;bazel build --config windows --compilation_mode=opt --copt=/GL //cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy the Linux build output files &lt;code&gt;cdc_fuse_fs&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;libfuse.so&lt;/code&gt;from&lt;code&gt;bazel-bin/cdc_fuse_fs&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;bazel-bin\cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt;on the Windows machine.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tools require a setup where you can use SSH and SFTP from the Windows machine to the Linux device without entering a password, e.g. by using key-based authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, the tools search &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sftp.exe&lt;/code&gt; from the path environment
variable. If you can run the following commands in a Windows cmd without
entering your password, you are all set:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh user@linux.device.com
sftp user@linux.device.com
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; is the Linux user and &lt;code&gt;linux.device.com&lt;/code&gt; is the Linux host to
SSH into or copy the file to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If additional arguments are required, it is recommended to provide an SSH config file. By default, both &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sftp.exe&lt;/code&gt; use the file at
&lt;code&gt;%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config&lt;/code&gt; on Windows, if it exists. A possible config file
that sets a username, a port, an identity file and a known host file could look
as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Host linux_device
	HostName linux.device.com
	User user
	Port 12345
	IdentityFile C:\path\to\id_rsa
	UserKnownHostsFile C:\path\to\known_hosts
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sftp.exe&lt;/code&gt; cannot be found, you can specify the full paths via
the command line arguments &lt;code&gt;--ssh-command&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--sftp-command&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream start&lt;/code&gt; (see below), or set the environment variables
&lt;code&gt;CDC_SSH_COMMAND&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CDC_SFTP_COMMAND&lt;/code&gt;, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;set CDC_SSH_COMMAND="C:\path with space\to\ssh.exe"
set CDC_SFTP_COMMAND="C:\path with space\to\sftp.exe"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that you can also specify SSH configuration via the environment variables instead of using a config file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;set CDC_SSH_COMMAND=C:\path\to\ssh.exe -p 12345 -i C:\path\to\id_rsa -oUserKnownHostsFile=C:\path\to\known_hosts
set CDC_SFTP_COMMAND=C:\path\to\sftp.exe -P 12345 -i C:\path\to\id_rsa -oUserKnownHostsFile=C:\path\to\known_hosts
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the small &lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt; and the capital &lt;code&gt;-P&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;sftp.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Google internal usage, set the following environment variables to enable SSH authentication using a Google security key:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;set CDC_SSH_COMMAND=C:\gnubby\bin\ssh.exe
set CDC_SFTP_COMMAND=C:\gnubby\bin\sftp.exe
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that you will have to touch the security key multiple times during the first run. Subsequent runs only require a single touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; is used similar to &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; or the Linux &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; command. To sync a
single Windows file &lt;code&gt;C:\path\to\file.txt&lt;/code&gt; to the home directory &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; on the Linux
device &lt;code&gt;linux.device.com&lt;/code&gt;, run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\path\to\file.txt user@linux.device.com:~
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; understands the usual Windows wildcards &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\path\to\*.txt user@linux.device.com:~
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To sync the contents of the Windows directory &lt;code&gt;C:\path\to\assets&lt;/code&gt; recursively to
&lt;code&gt;~/assets&lt;/code&gt; on the Linux device, run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\path\to\assets\* user@linux.device.com:~/assets -r
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get per file progress, add &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\path\to\assets\* user@linux.device.com:~/assets -vr
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tool also supports local syncs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\path\to\assets\* C:\path\to\destination -vr
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To stream the Windows directory &lt;code&gt;C:\path\to\assets&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;~/assets&lt;/code&gt; on the Linux
device, run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream start C:\path\to\assets user@linux.device.com:~/assets
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes all files and directories in &lt;code&gt;C:\path\to\assets&lt;/code&gt; available on
&lt;code&gt;~/assets&lt;/code&gt; immediately, as if it were a local copy. However, data is streamed
from Windows to Linux as files are accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To stop the streaming session, enter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream stop user@linux.device.com:~/assets
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The command also accepts wildcards. For instance,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream stop user@*:*
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;stops all existing streaming sessions for the given user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On first run, &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt; starts a background service, which does all the work.
The &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream stop&lt;/code&gt; commands are just RPC clients that
talk to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The service logs to &lt;code&gt;%APPDATA%\cdc-file-transfer\logs&lt;/code&gt; by default. The logs are
useful to investigate issues with asset streaming. To pass custom arguments, or
to debug the service, create a JSON config file at
&lt;code&gt;%APPDATA%\cdc-file-transfer\cdc_stream.json&lt;/code&gt; with command line flags.
For instance,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{ "verbosity":3 }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;instructs the service to log debug messages. Try &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream start-service -h&lt;/code&gt;
for a list of available flags. Alternatively, run the service manually with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream start-service
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and pass the flags as command line arguments. When you run the service manually, the flag &lt;code&gt;--log-to-stdout&lt;/code&gt; is particularly useful as it logs to the console
instead of to the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; always logs to the console. To increase log verbosity, pass &lt;code&gt;-vvv&lt;/code&gt;
for debug logs or &lt;code&gt;-vvvv&lt;/code&gt; for verbose logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For both sync and stream, the debug logs contain all SSH and SFTP commands that are attempted to run, which is very useful for troubleshooting. If a command fails unexpectedly, copy it and run it in isolation. Pass &lt;code&gt;-vv&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-vvv&lt;/code&gt; for
additional debug output.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How we built blockdiff, an open-source tool for rapid block-level diffs and snapshots of VM disks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We made it open-source here: https://github.com/CognitionAI/blockdiff&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually, I’m a researcher working on areas like RL for coding agents – but one day I became annoyed by our slow VM startup times. So I took the plunge into systems engineering and built the first version of our VM hypervisor called &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt;. It now powers both our research &amp;amp; all of Devin production workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devin writes and runs code in a VM environment. Why VMs instead of Docker? For untrusted user workloads we require full isolation for security purposes. Moreover, many realistic dev environments require using Docker (e.g. to spin up a backend service or database). Good luck running Docker inside Docker, so we needed VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to EC2, &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt; was able to bring down VM startup times by about 10x. The real pain point, however, were EC2’s long snapshot times. We want a lot of flexibility (e.g. forking, rollback and suspending VMs) that all require taking disk snapshots. On EC2 taking disk snapshots usually took a whopping 30+ minutes, which would be a terrible experience for our users. With &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt; we were able to bring this down to just a couple of seconds – a 200x speed-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we built our own file format &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt; for instant block-level diffs of VM disks. Creating block-level diffs of two files is a much broader problem that goes beyond VM disks. We assumed there must be an existing open-source solution. To our surprise we couldn’t find such a tool, so we’re open-sourcing our implementation today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three reasons why we want incremental snapshots of VM disks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dev environments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our customers set up their dev environment in Devin’s VM, which we save to reuse via a disk snapshot. If most customers use just 1GB of additional disk space, we don’t want all the snapshots to redundantly store the entire 15GB operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sleep &amp;amp; wake up&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Devin sleeps, we want to store the current session state without making another copy of the dev environment. The limiting factor isn’t even storage cost – it’s wake up time. Transferring a 50 MB snapshot of session state is much faster than a multi-GB snapshot of the entire dev environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disk rollback&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable rolling back the disk during a session, we want to stack many of these incremental snapshots on top of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tried very hard to find a way to implement disk snapshotting while satisfying all these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compact&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The snapshot file should grow proportional to the difference between the base image and the VM disk. It’s too expensive to snapshot the entire disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instantaneous&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking a snapshot should be instant and should not require significant disk I/O. We design our file format so that creating snapshot operates mostly on file metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zero overhead&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VM should not experience any overhead, e.g. slower reads or writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplicity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things like this can easily break and have thousands of edge cases, so we want a solution that’s as simple as possible, to spare ourselves lots of debugging time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implementation of the file format is a single, few-hundred line Rust file. It stands on the shoulders of giants: most of the complexity is handled by the Linux kernel’s excellent CoW implementation in the XFS filesystem. The core idea is simple: For two files A &amp;amp; B, &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt; stores only the blocks in B that are different from blocks in A.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explain the difficulty of achieving all these design goals, let’s first explain the limitations of other solutions we considered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not just read the files and compute a binary diff?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to compute a binary diff directly based on file content would be quite slow. Even on the fastest SSDs, scanning an entire 128 GB disk image can take 30-60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not OverlayFS?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first few weeks of &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt;’s existence we used OverlayFS. However, it had two issues: It didn’t have clean support for incremental snapshots without remounting. Moreover, it created big issues when users wanted to use Docker – which would fall back to the vfs storage driver, consume 17x more storage and be 6x slower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not ZFS?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we started using &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt;, we had implemented a version of rollback using ZFS inside of the VM. It had multiple limitations: For reliability reasons, we mounted ZFS only on the home dir, so it wasn’t possible to roll back system-level changes like package installs. Moreover, the snapshot logic had to live inside of the VM, visible to the user. We also briefly considered using ZFS outside of the VM on the hypervisor. However, we concluded that the end-to-end performance of creating &amp;amp; transferring ZFS snapshots (send/recv) seemed to most likely be lower than what we can achieve with &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about the qcow2 file format?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We didn’t deeply consider qcow2 because our hypervisor only supports raw disk images. Further below in the bonus section, we show a performance comparison that shows an example of &lt;code&gt;qemu-img convert&lt;/code&gt; becoming quite slow for large files. Evidently, qcow2 doesn’t operate on metadata only (unlike &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s first explain two Linux concepts that are necessary to understand the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparse files&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparse files only allocate disk space for non-zero data. This is particularly helpful for VM disk images that have mostly unused space. For a sparse file, the logical size of the file is different from the actual disk usage. In this example, &lt;code&gt;ls -hl disk.img&lt;/code&gt; shows the logical size which is 32GB. However, it only uses 261 MB of actual disk space – which you can see with &lt;code&gt;du -h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ubuntu@devin-box:~$ ls -hl disk.img
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 32G Jan  9 07:57 disk.img
ubuntu@devin-box:~$ du -h disk.img
261M    disk.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can create an empty sparse file with &lt;code&gt;truncate -s&lt;/code&gt; and then format it as an &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; disk image using &lt;code&gt;mkfs.ext4&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ubuntu@devin-box:~$ truncate -s 32G disk.img

    &lt;p&gt;Copy-on-write (CoW)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy-on-write is a feature supported by many modern Linux filesystems (XFS, ZFS, btrfs). Instead of immediately copying data when requested, the system shares the original data and only creates a separate copy when modifications are made to either the original or the copy. This bookkeeping happens on a block-by-block basis: blocks are the fundamental unit of storage of modern file systems and typically 4KB in size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the difference between copying a file with &amp;amp; without “reflink” (another name for copy-on-write) for a 128GB disk image on a very fast NVMe SSD:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ubuntu@devin-box:~$ time cp --reflink=never base.img vm1.img

real    0m24.532s
user    0m0.142s
sys     0m18.785s

ubuntu@devin-box:~$ time cp --reflink=always base.img vm2.img

real    0m0.008s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.004s&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disk images as files&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our hypervisor &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt;, VM disks are just files on its filesystem. Each VM disk is a CoW copy of the base disk image (e.g. the operating system) – which means that it shares all blocks by default and greedily allocates new blocks on write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s important to differentiate between the filesystem inside &amp;amp; outside of the VMs: Inside our VMs we use ext4 as the filesystem because it’s most widespread and the default on Ubuntu. Outside, the hypervisor uses XFS as its filesystem – crucially with reflink (= copy-on-write) enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say we have two files: &lt;code&gt;base.img&lt;/code&gt; is a disk image of our operating system and &lt;code&gt;vm.img&lt;/code&gt; is a CoW copy of &lt;code&gt;base.img&lt;/code&gt;. The VM is reading &amp;amp; writing from &lt;code&gt;vm.img&lt;/code&gt;. Our goal is to create a separate file &lt;code&gt;snapshot.bdiff&lt;/code&gt; that stores only the blocks from &lt;code&gt;vm.img&lt;/code&gt; that are different from &lt;code&gt;base.img&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;File extent maps&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our objective is to only operate on the filesystem metadata and to never touch the actual contents of the files. To be precise, the key lies in the file extent maps which you can get using the FIEMAP syscall. The &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt; tool can be used to view the syscall outputs in a nicely formatted way (or alternatively use the Linux utility &lt;code&gt;filefrag -v disk.img&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;blockdiff view disk.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The file extent map represents the mapping from logical blocks in the file to physical blocks on the hard drive. This mapping is grouped in extents which are sequences of blocks that are allocated contiguously. You might’ve heard of the word (de)fragmentation before: In an ideal world, every file would just be a single extent, stored as one contiguous chunk on the hard drive. However, due to fragmentation files usually end up split across multiple extents scattered throughout the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading file extent maps from Rust&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;fiemap&lt;/code&gt; crate in Rust we have a clean wrapper around the underlying Linux syscall FIEMAP IOCTL. Getting the extents of the target file is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let mut target_extents: Vec&amp;lt;_&amp;gt; = fiemap::fiemap(target_file)?.collect::&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each extent looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub struct FiemapExtent {
    pub fe_logical: u64, // logical offset (in bytes)
    pub fe_physical: u64, // physical offset (in bytes)
    pub fe_length: u64, // length of extent (in bytes)
    pub fe_flags: FiemapExtentFlags,
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The logical block addresses are the location of data in the file (i.e. in our VM disk). The physical block addresses are where the data is stored on the hypervisor disk. An extent is a sequence of contiguous logical blocks with contiguous physical addresses. If two logical blocks from different files, point to the same physical blocks, then they are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exercise for the reader: Write an algorithm that takes in file extent map A &amp;amp; B and returns a list of extents from B that are different from A. Be careful that extent boundaries are in general not aligned between A &amp;amp; B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defining a file format (.bdiff)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the last step is to serialize this into a file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/// - Header:
///   - 8 bytes: magic string ("BDIFFv1\0")
///   - 8 bytes: target file size (little-endian)
///   - 8 bytes: base file size (little-endian)
///   - 8 bytes: number of ranges (little-endian)
///   - Ranges array, each range containing:
///     - 8 bytes: logical offset (little-endian)
///     - 8 bytes: length (little-endian)
/// - Padding to next block boundary (4 KiB)
/// - Range data (contiguous blocks of data)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small header contains information about which logical block ranges the file contains. After that, it stores all differing blocks contiguously. When creating (or applying) blockdiffs, writing the small header is the only disk I/O that needs to happen. All the actual data can share the same physical blocks with &lt;code&gt;vm.img&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. creating the rest of the file is purely a “rewiring” of file metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exercise for the reader: What piece in the blockdiff codebase is responsible for the fact that the range data shares the same physical blocks as &lt;code&gt;vm.img&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install and build the binary:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/cognitionai/blockdiff &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd blockdiff
cargo install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reminder that we need to be on a filesystem with reflink enabled (e.g. XFS). Now, let’s create a snapshot of &lt;code&gt;vm1.img&lt;/code&gt; against the base image &lt;code&gt;base.img&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;blockdiff create snapshot.bdiff vm1.img --base base.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can use that snapshot, to create a new disk image &lt;code&gt;vm2.img:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;blockdiff apply snapshot.bdiff vm2.img --base base.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This file should be identical to &lt;code&gt;vm1.img&lt;/code&gt;. We can verify this with hashes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;xxhsum vm1.img
xxhsum vm2.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since this is only a file metadata operation, creating and applying snapshots is effectively instant – no matter how large the disk images. After creating the snapshot file locally, the file still needs to be transferred to storage which happens with about 2 GB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;On our hypervisor machines:
Reading/writing 20 GB of data: ~6.5 s
Creating 20 GB snapshot with blockdiff: ~200 ms&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fun little challenge that we faced while building &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt; is “compactifying” sparse files. If you try to upload a sparse disk image to blob storage, it will upload the entire logical size since blob storage doesn’t natively understand sparse files. So we were looking for a way to turn a sparse file of logical size X &amp;gt; disk usage Y into a “compact” file with logical size Y = disk usage Y.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most online sources seemed to recommend using tar which ended up being extremely slow. You would usually expect network latency to be the main bottleneck but it turned out tar would be 5x slower than the network transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite not using qcow2 in our hypervisor itself, it turned out that &lt;code&gt;qemu-img convert&lt;/code&gt; gave us exactly what we wanted: converting a raw, sparse disk image into a compact one. Moreover, it did it 5x faster than tar. To be clear, this was a random hack of ours and it isn’t what &lt;code&gt;qemu-img convert&lt;/code&gt; is intended to be used for. However, with larger disks it becomes clear that even qcow2 starts being slow – it clearly isn’t a metadata-only operation. Fortunately, &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt; is super fast at all sizes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on VM hypervisors was a fun foray into systems programming. Hopefully, this gave you a glimpse of the work we do at Cognition. Of course, there are many more open questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to work on these problems, reach out to us or apply here!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Databricks, Kubernetes is at the heart of our internal systems. Within a single Kubernetes cluster, the default networking primitives like ClusterIP services, CoreDNS, and kube-proxy are often sufficient. They offer a simple abstraction to route service traffic. But when performance and reliability matter, these defaults begin to show their limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll share how we built an intelligent, client-side load balancing system to improve traffic distribution, reduce tail latencies, and make service-to-service communication more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are a Databricks user, you don’t need to understand this blog to be able to use the platform to its fullest. But if you’re interested in taking a peek under the hood, read on to hear about some of the cool stuff we’ve been working on!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-performance service-to-service communication in Kubernetes has several challenges, especially when using persistent HTTP/2 connections, as we do at Databricks with gRPC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this model generally works, it quickly breaks down in performance-sensitive environments, leading to significant limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Databricks, we operate hundreds of stateless services communicating over gRPC within each Kubernetes cluster. These services are often high-throughput, latency-sensitive, and run at significant scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default load balancing model falls short in this environment for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These limitations pushed us to rethink how we handle service-to-service communication within a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address the limitations of kube-proxy and default service routing in Kubernetes, we built a proxyless, fully client-driven load balancing system backed by a custom service discovery control plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fundamental requirement we had was to support load balancing at the application layer, and removing dependency on the DNS on a critical path. A Layer 4 load balancer, like kube-proxy, cannot make intelligent per-request decisions for Layer 7 protocols (such as gRPC) that utilize persistent connections. This architectural constraint creates bottlenecks, necessitating a more intelligent approach to traffic management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following table summarizes the key differences and the advantages of a client-side approach:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Dependency on DNS/Proxy&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;High&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Minimal/Minimal, not on a critical path&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Operational Control&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Limited&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fine-grained&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system enables intelligent, up-to-date request routing with minimal dependency on DNS or Layer 4 networking. It gives clients the ability to make informed decisions based on live topology and health data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The figure shows our custom Endpoint Discovery Service in action. It reads service and endpoint data from the Kubernetes API and translates it into xDS responses. Both Armeria clients and API proxies stream requests to it and receive live endpoint metadata, which is then used by application servers for intelligent routing with fallback clusters as backup.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We run a lightweight control plane that continuously monitors the Kubernetes API for changes to Services and EndpointSlices. It maintains an up-to-date view of all backend pods for every service, including metadata like zone, readiness, and shard labels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A strategic advantage for Databricks was the widespread adoption of a common framework for service communication across most of its internal services, which are predominantly written in Scala. This shared foundation allowed us to embed client-side service discovery and load balancing logic directly into the framework, making it easy to adopt across teams without requiring custom implementation effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each service integrates with our custom client, which subscribes to updates from the control plane for the services it depends on during the connection setup. The client maintains a dynamic list of healthy endpoints, including metadata like zone or shard, and updates automatically as the control plane pushes changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the client bypasses both DNS resolution and kube-proxy entirely, it always has a live, accurate view of service topology. This allows us to implement consistent and efficient load balancing strategies across all internal services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rpc client performs request-aware load balancing using strategies like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More advanced strategies, like zone-aware routing, required careful tuning and deeper context about service topology, traffic patterns, and failure modes; a topic to explore in a dedicated follow-up post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ensure the effectiveness of our approach, we ran extensive simulations, experiments, and real-world metric analysis. We validated that load remained evenly distributed and that key metrics like tail latency, error rate, and cross-zone traffic cost stayed within target thresholds. The flexibility to adapt strategies per-service has been valuable, but in practice, keeping it simple (and consistent) has worked best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our control plane extends its utility beyond the internal service-to-service communication. It plays a crucial role in managing external traffic by speaking the xDS API to Envoy, the discovery protocol that lets clients fetch up-to-date configuration (like clusters, endpoints, and routing rules) dynamically. Specifically, it implements Endpoint Discovery Service (EDS) to provide Envoy with consistent and up-to-date metadata about backend endpoints by programming ClusterLoadAssignment resources. This ensures that gateway-level routing (e.g., for ingress or public-facing traffic) aligns with the same source of truth used by internal clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This architecture gives us fine-grained control over routing behavior while decoupling service discovery from the limitations of DNS and kube-proxy. The key takeaways are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After deploying our client-side load balancing system, we observed significant improvements across both performance and efficiency:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the rollout delivered clear benefits, we also uncovered several challenges and insights along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While developing our client-side load balancing approach, we evaluated other alternative solutions. Here’s why we ultimately decided against these:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kubernetes headless services (clusterIP: None) provide direct pod IPs via DNS, allowing clients and proxies (like Envoy) to perform their own load balancing. This approach bypasses the limitation of connection-based distribution in kube-proxy and enables advanced load balancing strategies offered by Envoy (such as round robin, consistent hashing, and least-loaded round robin).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In theory, switching existing ClusterIP services to headless services (or creating additional headless services using the same selector) would mitigate connection reuse issues by providing clients direct endpoint visibility. However, this approach comes with practical limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although headless services can offer a temporary improvement over ClusterIP services, the practical challenges and limitations made them unsuitable as a long-term solution at Databricks' scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Istio provides powerful Layer 7 load balancing features using Envoy sidecars injected into every pod. These proxies handle routing, retries, circuit breaking, and more - all managed centrally through a control plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this model offers many capabilities, we found it unsuitable for our environment at Databricks for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also evaluated Istio’s Ambient Mesh. Since Databricks already had proprietary systems for functions like certificate distribution, and our routing patterns were relatively static, the added complexity of adopting a full mesh outweighed the benefits. This was especially true for a small infra team supporting a predominantly Scala codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that one of the biggest advantages of sidecar-based meshes is language-agnosticism: teams can standardize resiliency and routing across polyglot services without maintaining client libraries everywhere. At Databricks, however, our environment is heavily Scala-based, and our monorepo plus fast CI/CD culture make the proxyless, client-library approach far more practical. Rather than introducing the operational burden of sidecars, we invested in building first-class load balancing directly into our libraries and infrastructure components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our current client-side load balancing approach has significantly improved internal service-to-service communication. Yet, as Databricks continues to scale, we’re exploring several advanced areas to further enhance our system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-Cluster and Cross-Region Load Balancing: As we manage thousands of Kubernetes clusters across multiple regions, extending intelligent load balancing beyond individual clusters is critical. We are exploring technologies like flat L3 networking and service-mesh solutions, integrating seamlessly with multi-region Endpoint Discovery Service (EDS) clusters. This will enable robust cross-cluster traffic management, fault tolerance, and globally efficient resource utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advanced Load Balancing Strategies for AI Use Cases: We plan to introduce more sophisticated strategies, such as weighted load balancing, to better support advanced AI workloads. These strategies will enable finer-grained resource allocation and intelligent routing decisions based on specific application characteristics, ultimately optimizing performance, resource consumption, and cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're interested in working on large-scale distributed infrastructure challenges like this, we're hiring. Come build with us — explore open roles at Databricks!&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Eshan Ramesh [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Thu, 12 Jun 2025 11:47:23 UTC (6,672 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Fri, 4 Jul 2025 12:27:28 UTC (6,672 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v3] Fri, 5 Sep 2025 11:39:36 UTC (9,960 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t invent categories to study functors; I invented them to study natural transformations. — Saunders Mac Lane&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of a morphism between functors, or natural transformation. Understanding natural transformations will enable us to define category equality and some other advanced concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural transformations really are at the heart of category theory, however, their importance is not obvious at first. So, before introducing them, I like to talk, once more, about the body of knowledge that this heart maintains (I am good with metaphors… in principle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our first section aims to introduce natural transformation as a motivating example for creating a way to say that two categories are equal. But for that, we need to understand what equal categories are and should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, are you ready to hear about equivalent categories and natural transformations? Actually it is my opinion that you are not (no offence, they are just very hard!). So, we will take a longer route. I can put this next section anywhere in this book, and it would always be neither here nor there. But anyway, if you are studying math, you are probably interested in the nature of the universe. “What is the quintessential characteristic of all things in this world?” I hear you ask…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world is the collection of facts, not of things. — Ludwig Wittgenstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the quintessential characteristic of all things in this world? Some 2500 years ago, the philosopher Parmenides gave an answer to this question, postulating that the nature of the universe is permanence, stasis. According to his view, what we perceive as processes/transformations/change is merely illusory appearances (“Whatever is is, and what is not cannot be”). He said that that things never really change, they only appear to change, or (another way to put it), only appearances change, but the essence does not (I think this is pretty much how the word “essence” came to exist).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although far from obviously true, his view is easy for people to relate to — objects are all around us, everything we “see”, both literally (in real life), or metaphorically (in mathematics and other disciplines), can be viewed as objects, persisting through space and time. If we subscribe to this view, then we would think that the key to understanding the world is understanding what objects are. In my opinion, this is what set theory does, to some extent, as well as classical logic (Plato was influenced by Parmenides when he created his theory of forms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is another way to approach the question about the nature of the universe, which is equally compelling. Because, what is an object, when viewed by itself? Can we study an object in isolation? And will there anything left to study about it, once it is detached from its environment? If a given object undergoes a process to get all of it’s part replaced, is it still the same object?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking such questions might lead us to suspect that, although what we see when we look at the universe are the objects, it is the processes/relations/transitions or morphisms between the objects that are the real key to understanding it. For example, when we think hard about everyday objects we realize that each of them has a specific functions (note the term) without which, a thing would not be itself e.g. is a lamp that doesn’t glow, still a lamp? Is there food that is non-edible (or an edible item that isn’t food)? And this is even more valid for mathematical objects, which, without the functions that go between them, are not objects at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, instead of thinking about objects that just happen to have some morphisms between them, we might take the opposite view and say that objects are only interesting as sources and targets of morphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although old, dating back to Parmenides’ alleged rival Heraclitus, this view has been largely unexplored, until the 20th century, when a real mathematical revolution happened: Bertrand Russell created type theory, his student Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote a little book, from which the above quote comes, and this book inspired a group of mathematicians and logicians, known as the “Vienna circle”. Part of this group was Rudolph Carnap who coined the word “functor”…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An embodiment of Heraclitus’ view in the realm of category theory is the concept of isomorphism invariance that we implicitly touched several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All categorical constructions that we covered (products/coproducts, initial/terminal objects, functional objects in logic) are isomorphism-invariant. Or, equivalently, they define an objects up to an isomorphism. Or, in other words, if there are two or more objects that are isomorphic to one another, and one of them has a given property, then the rest of them would to also have this property as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, in category theory isomorphism = equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to understanding category theory lies in understanding isomorphism invariance. And the key to understanding isomorphism invariance are natural transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s return to the question that we were pondering at the beginning of the previous chapter — what does it mean for two categories to be equal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the prev chapter, we talked a lot about how great isomorphisms are and how important they are for defining the concept of equality in category theory, but at the same time we said that categorical isomorphisms do not capture the concept of equality of categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because (though it may seem contradictory at first) categorical isomorphisms are not isomorphism invariant, i.e. categories that only differ by having some additional isomorphic objects aren’t isomorphic themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we need a new concept of equality of categories. A concept that would elucidate the differences between categories with different structure, but also the sameness of categories that have the same categorical structures, disregarding the differences that are irrelevant for category-theoretic standpoint. That concept is equivalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parmenides: This category surely cannot be equal to the other one — it has a different amount of objects!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heraclitus: Who cares bro, they are isomorphic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand equivalent categories better, let’s go back to the functor between a given map and the area it represents (we will only consider the thin categories (AKA orders) for now). This functor would be invertible (and the categories — isomorphic) when the map should represent the area completely i.e. there should be arrow for each road and a point for each little place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a map is necessary if your goal is to know about all places, however, like we said, when working with category theory, we are not so interested in places, but in the routes that connect them i.e. we focus not on objects but on morphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if there are intersections that are positioned in such a way that there are routes from one and to the other and vice-versa a map may collapse them into one intersection and still show all routes that exist (the tree routes would be represented by the “identity route”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two categories are not isomorphic — going from one of them to the other and back again doesn’t lead you to the same object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, going from one of them to the other would lead you at least to an isomorphic object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case we say that the orders are equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that two orders are isomorphic if there are two functors, such that going from one to the other and back again leads you to the same object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And two orders are equivalent if going from one of them to the other and back again leads you to the same object, or to an object that is isomorphic to the one you started with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when does this happen? To understand this, we plot the orders as a Hasse diagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see that, although not all objects are connected one-to-one, all objects at a given level are connected to objects of the corresponding level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To formalize that notion, we remember the concept of equivalence classes that we covered in the chapter about orders. Let’s visualize the relationship of the equivalence classes of the two orders that we saw above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see that they are isomorphic. And that is no coincidence: two orders are equivalent precisely when the orders made of their equivalence classes are isomorphic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a definition for equivalence of orders, but unfortunately, it does not hold for all categories — when we are working with orders, we can get away by just thinking about objects, but categories demands that we think about morphisms i.e. to prove two categories are equivalent, we should establish an isomorphism between their morphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the following two categories are not equivalent, although their equivalence classes are isomorphic — the category on the left has just one morphism, but the category on the right has two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way of defining equivalence of categories is by generalizing the notion of equivalence classes of orders to what we call skeletons of categories, a skeleton of a category being a subcategory in which all objects that are isomorphic to one another are “merged” into one object (isomorphic objects are necessarily identical).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we will leave this (pardon my French) as an exercise for the reader. Why? We already did this when we generalized the notion of normal set-theoretic functions to functors, and so it makes more sense to build up on that notion. Also, we need a motivating example for introducing natural transformations, remember?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the chapter about orders, we presented a definition of order isomorphisms, that is based on objects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An order isomorphism is essentially an isomorphism between the orders’ underlying sets (invertible function). However, besides their underlying sets, orders also have the arrows that connect them, so there is one more condition: in order for an invertible function to constitute an order isomorphism it has to respect those arrows, in other words it should be order preserving. More specifically, applying this function (let’s call it $F$) to any two elements in one set ($a$ and $b$) should result in two elements that have the same corresponding order in the other set (so $a ≤ b$ if and only if $F(a) ≤ F(b)$).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That a way to define them, but it is not the best way. Now that we know about functors (which, as we said, serve as functions between the orders and other categories), we can devise a new, simpler definition, which would also be valid for all categories, not just orders, and for all forms of equality (isomorphism and equivalence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We begin with the definition of set isomorphism:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two sets $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic (or $A ≅ B$) if there exist functions $f: A \to B$ and its reverse $g: B \to A$, such that $f \circ g = ID_{B}$ and $g \circ f = ID_{A}$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To amend it so it is valid for all categories by just replacing the word “function” with “functor” and “set” with “category”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two categories $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic (or $A \cong B$) if there exist functors $f: A \to B$ and its reverse $g: B \to A$, such that $f \circ g = ID_{B}$ and $g \circ f = ID_{A}$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task 1: Check if that definition is valid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, this definition, is just one find-and-replace operation away from the definition of equivalence. We get there only by replace equality with isomorphism (so, $=$ with $\cong$).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two categories $A$ and $B$ are equivalent (or $A \simeq B$) if there exist functors $f: A \to B$ and its reverse $g: B \to A$, such that $f \circ g \cong ID_{B}$ and $g \circ f \cong ID_{A}$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like we said at the beginning, with isomorphisms, going back and forth brings us to the same object, while with equivalence the object is just isomorphic to the original one. This is truly all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is only one problem, though — we never said what it means for functors to be isomorphic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how can we make the above definition “come to life”? The title of this chapter outlines the things we need to define:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this sounds complicated, remember that we are doing the same thing we always did — talking about isomorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the very first chapter of this book, we introduced set isomorphisms, which are quite easy, and now we reached the point to examine functor isomorphisms. So, we are doing the same thing. Although actually…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But actually, natural transformations are quite different from morphisms and functors, (the definition is not “recursive”, like the definitions of functor and morphism are). This is because functions and functors are both morphisms between objects (or 1-morphisms), while natural transformations are morphisms between morphisms (known as 2-morphisms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But enough talking, let’s draw some diagrams. We know that natural transformations are morphisms between functors, so let’s draw two functors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The functors have the same signature. Naturally. How else can there be morphisms between them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a functor is comprised of two mappings (object mapping and morphism mapping) so a mapping between functors, would consist of “object mapping mapping” and “morphism mapping mapping” (yes, I often do get in trouble with my choice of terminology, why do you ask?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s first connect the object mappings of the two functors, creating what we called “object mapping mapping”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is simpler than it sounds when we realize that we only need to connect the object in functors’ target category — the objects in the source category would just always be the same for both functors, as both functors would include all object from the source category (as that is what functors (and morphisms in general) do). In other words, mapping the two functors’ object components involves nothing more than specifying a bunch of morphisms in the target category: one morphism for each object in the source category i.e. each object from the image of the first functor, should have one arrow coming from it (and to an object of the second functor, so, for example, our current source category has two objects and we specify two morphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that this mapping does not map every object from the target category, i.e. not all objects have arrows coming from them (e.g. here the black and blue square do not have arrows), although, in some cases, it might.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task 2: When exactly would the mapping encompass all objects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morphism part might seem hard… until we realize that, once the connections between the object mappings are already established, there is only one way to connect the morphisms — we take each morphism of the source category and connect the two morphisms given by the two functors, in the target category. And that’s all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, actually, there is also this condition that the above diagram should commute (the naturality condition), but that happens pretty much automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like anything else in category theory, natural transformations have some laws that they are required to pass. In this case it’s one law, typically called the naturality law, or the naturality condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we state this law, let’s recap where are we now: We have two functors $F$ and $G$ that have the same type signature (so $F : C \to D$ and $G : C \to D$ for some categories $C$ and $D$), and a family of morphisms in the target category $D$ (denoted $\alpha : F \Rightarrow G$) one for each object in $C$, that map each object of the target of the functor $F$ (or the image of $F$ in $D$ as it is also called) to some objects of the image of $G$. This is a transformation, but not necessarily a natural one. A transformation is natural, when this diagram commutes for all morphisms in $C$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i.e. a transformation is natural when every morphism $f$ in $C$ is mapped to morphisms $F(f)$ by $F$ and to $G(f)$ by $G$ (not very imaginative names, I know), in such a way, that we have $\alpha \circ F(f) = G(f) \circ \alpha$ i.e. when starting from the white square, when going right and then down (via the yellow square) is be equivalent to going down and then right (via the black one).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may view a natural transformation is a mapping between morphisms and commutative squares: two functors and a natural transformation between two categories means that for each morphism in the source category of the functors, there exist one commutative square at the target category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we fully understand this, we realize that commutative squares are made of morphisms too, so, like morphisms, they compose — for any two morphisms with appropriate type signatures that have we can compose to get a third one, we have two naturality squares which compose the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means natural transformation make up a…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Oh wait, it’s too early for that, is it?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After understanding natural transformations, natural isomorphisms, are a no-brainer: a natural transformation is just a family of morphisms in a given category that satisfy certain criteria, then what would a natural isomorphism be? That’s right — it is a family of isomorphisms that satisfy the same criteria. The diagram is the same as the one for ordinary natural transformation, except that $\alpha$ are not just ordinary morphisms, but isomorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the turning those morphisms into isomorphisms makes the diagram commute in more than one way i.e. if we have the naturality condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$\alpha \circ F(f) = G(f) \circ \alpha$ i.e. the two paths going from white to blue are equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$F(f) \circ \alpha = \alpha \circ G(f)$ i.e. the two paths going from black to yellow are also equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sorry, what were we talking about again? Oh yeah — categorical equivalence. Remember that categorical equivalence is the reason why we tackle natural transformations and isomorphisms? Or perhaps it was the other way around? Never mind, let’s recap what we discussed so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the section we introduced the notion of equivalence as two functors, such that going from one of them to the other and back again leads you to the same object, or to an object that is isomorphic to the one you started with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, we discussed that for categories that are not thin (thick?) the situation is a bit more complex since they can have more than one morphism between two objects, and we should worry not only about isomorphic objects, but about isomorphic morphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we will show how these two notions are formalized by the definition that we presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two categories $A$ and $B$ are equivalent (or $A \simeq B$) if there exist functors $f: A \to B$ and its reverse $g: B \to A$, such that $f \circ g \cong ID_{A}$ and $g \circ f \cong ID_{A}$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand, this how are the two related, let’s construct the identity functor of the category that we have been using as an example all this time. Note that we are drawing the one and the same category two times (as opposed to just drawing an arrow coming from each object to itself), to make the diagrams more readable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, we draw the composite of the two functors that establish an equivalence between the two categories, highlighting the 3 “interesting” objects, i.e. the ones due to which the categories aren’t isomorphic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we ask ourselves, in which cases does there exist an isomorphism between those two functors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer becomes trivial if we draw the isomorphism arrows connecting the three “interesting” objects in a different way (remember, this is the same category on the top and the bottom) — we can see that these are exactly the arrows that enable us to construct an isomorphism between the two functors (the others are just identity arrows).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when would this isomorphism be such that preserves the structure of the category (so that each morphism from the output of the composite functor has an equivalent one in the output of the identity)? Exactly when the isomorphism is natural i.e. when every morphism is mapped to a commuting square, e.g. here is the commuting square of the morphism that is marked in red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i.e. naturality condition assures us that the morphisms in the target of the functor behave in the same way as their counterparts in the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this, we are finished with categorical equivalence, but not with natural transformations — natural transformations are a very general concept, and categorical equivalences are only a very narrow case of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of this book, we learned that programming/computer science is the study of the category of types in programming languages. However (in order to avoid this being too obvious) in the computer science context, we use different terms for the standard category-theoretic concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We learned that objects are known as types, products and coproducts are, respectively, objects/tuple types and sum types. And, in the last chapter, we learned that functors are known as generic types. Now it’s the time to learn what natural transformations are in this context. They are known as (parametrically) polymorphic functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose this sounds a bit vague. If only we had some example of a natural transformation in programming, that we can use… But wait, we did show a natural transformation in the previous chapter, when we talked about pointed functors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right, a functor is pointed when there is a natural transformation between it and the identity functor i.e. to have one green arrow for every object/type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this clearly is a natural transformation. As a matter of fact, if we get down to the nitty-gritty, we would see that it resembles a lot the equivalence diagram that we saw earlier — both transformations involve the identity functor, and both transformations have the same category as source and target, that’s why we can put everything in one circle (we don’t do that in the equivalence diagram, but that’s just a matter of presentation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, the only difference between the two transformations is that an equivalence is defined by a natural natural isomorphism of a given functors to the identity functor ( $ID \cong f \circ g $ and $ID \cong g \circ f$), while a pointed functor is defined by a one-way natural transformation from the identity functor ($ID \to f $) i.e. the equivalence functor is pointed, but not the other way around).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We said that a natural transformation is equivalent to a (parametrically) polymorphic function in programming. But wait, wasn’t natural transformation something else (and much more complicated):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two functors $F$ and $G$ that have the same type signature (so $F : C \to D$ and $G : C \to D$ for some categories $C$ and $D$), and a family of morphisms in the target category $D$ (denoted $\alpha : F \Rightarrow G$) one for each object in $C$. Morphisms that map each object of the target of $F$ (or the image of $F$ in $D$ as it is also called) to some object in the target of $G$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed it is (I wasn’t lying to you, in case you are wondering), however, in the case of programming, the source and target categories of both functors are the same category ($Set$), so the whole condition regarding the functors’ type signatures can be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two&lt;/p&gt;&lt;del&gt;functors&lt;/del&gt;generic types $F$ and $G$&lt;del&gt;that have the same type signature&lt;/del&gt;and a family of morphisms in $Set$ (denoted $\alpha : Set \Rightarrow Set$) one for each object in $Set$, that map each target object of the functor $F$ (or the image of $F$ in $D$ as it is also called) to some target objects of functor $G$.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we know from the last chapter, a functor in programming is a generic type (which, has to have the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function with the appropriate signature).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what is a “family of morphisms in $Set$ one for each object in $Set$”? Well, the morphisms in the category $Set$ are functions, so that’s just a bunch of functions, one for each type. In Haskell notation, if we denote a random type by the letter \(a\)), it is $alpha : \forall a. F a \to G a$. But that’s exactly what polymorphic functions are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is how would we write the above definition in a more traditional language (we use capital &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of $a$, as customary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
function alpha&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;(a: F&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;) : G&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; {
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generic types work by replacing the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with some concrete type, like &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; etc. Specifically, the natural transformation from the identity functor to the list functor that puts each value in a singleton list looks like this $alpha :: \forall\ a. a \to List\ a$. Or in TypeScript:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
function array&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;(a: A) : Array&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; {
    return [a]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we rid ourselves of the feeling of confusion, that such an excessive amount of new terminology and concepts impose upon us (which can take years, by the way), we realize that there are, of course, many polymorphic functions/natural transformations that programmers use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in the previous chapter, we discussed one natural transformation/polymorphic function the function $\forall a.a \to [a]$ which puts every value in a singleton list. This function is a natural transformation between the identity functor and the list functor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much the only one that is useful with this signature (the others being $a \to [a, a]$, $a \to [a, a, a]$ etc.), but there are many examples with signature $list\ a \to list\ a$, such as the function to reverse a list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…or take1 that retrieves the first element of a list&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;or flatten a list of lists of things to a regular list of things (the signature of this one is a little different, it’s $list\ list\ a \to list\ a$).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task 3: Draw example naturality squares of the $reverse$ natural transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do the same for the rest of the transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before, we said that we shouldn’t worry too much about naturality, as it is satisfied every time. Statistically, however, this is not true — as far as I am concerned, about 99.999 percent of transformations aren’t really natural (I wonder if you can compute that percentage properly?). But at the same time, it just so happens (my favourite phrase when writing about maths) that all transformations that we care about are natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what does the naturality condition entail, in programming? To understand this, we construct some naturality squares of the transformations that we presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We choose two types that play the role of $a$, in our case $string$ and $num$ and one natural transformation, like the transformation between the identity functor and the list functor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagram commute when for all functions $f$, applying the $Ff$, the mapped/lifted version of $f$ with one functor (in our case this is just $F f : string \to num$ cause it is the identity functor), followed by ($alpha :: F b \to G\ b$), is equivalent to applying ($alpha:: F a \to G\ a$), and then the mapped version of $f$ with the other functor (in our case $G f :: List\ a \to List\ b$) i.e.&lt;/p&gt;\[\alpha \circ F\ f \cong G\ f \circ \alpha\]&lt;p&gt;(in the programming world, you would also see it as something like $\alpha (map\ f x) = map\ f (\alpha x)$, but note that here $map$ function means two different things on the two sides, Haskell is just smart enough to deduce which $fmap$ to use).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in TypeScript, when we are talking specifically about the identity functor and the list functor, the equality is expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[x].map(f) == [f(x)]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is this equation true in our case? To verify it, we take one last peak at the world of values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We acquire an $f$, that is, we a function that acts on simple values (not lists), such as the function $length : string \to num$, which returns the number of characters a string has and convert it, (or lift it, as the terminology goes) to a function that acts on more complex values, using the list functor, (and the higher-order function $map$).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, we take the input and output types for this function (in this case $string$ and $num$), and the two morphisms of a natural transformation (e.g the abstract function $\forall a.a \to [a]$) that correspond to those two types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we compose these two pairs of morphisms we observe that they indeed commute — we get two morphisms that are actually one and the same function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above square shows the transformation $\forall a.a \to [a]$ (which is between the identity functor and the list functor, here is another one, this time between the list functor and itself ($\forall a.[a] \to [a]$) — $reverse$&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(and you can see that this would work not just for $length$, but for any other function).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why does this happen? Why do these particular transformations make up a commuting square for each and every morphism?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple, at least in our specific case: the original, unlifted function $f :: a \to b$ (like our $length :: string \to num$) can only work on the individual values (not with structure), while the natural transformation functions, i.e. ones with signature $list :: a \to list\ a$ only alter the structure, and not individual values. The naturality condition just says that these two types of functions can be applied in any order that we please, without changing the end result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that if you have a sequence of natural transformations that you want to apply, (such as $reverse$ , $take$, $flatten$ etc) and some lifted functions ($F f$, $F g$), you can mix and match between the two sequences in any way you like and you will get the same result e.g.&lt;/p&gt;\[take1 \circ reverse \circ F\ f \circ F\ g\]&lt;p&gt;is the same as&lt;/p&gt;\[take1 \circ F\ f \circ reverse \circ F\ g\]&lt;p&gt;…or…&lt;/p&gt;\[F\ f \circ F\ g \circ take1 \circ reverse\]&lt;p&gt;…or any other such sequence (the only thing that isn’t permitted is to flip the members of the two sequences — ($take1 \circ reverse$ is of course different from $reverse \circ take1$and if you have $F\ f \circ F\ g$, then $F\ g \circ F\ f$ won’t be permitted at all due to the different type signatures).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task 4: Prove the above results, using the formula of the naturality condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unnatural”, or “non-natural” transformations (let’s call them just transformations) are mentioned so rarely, that we might be inclined to ask if they exist. The answer is “yes and no”. Why yes? On one hand, transformations, consist of an innumerable amount of morphisms, forming an ever more innumerable amount of squares and obviously nothing stops some of these squares to be non-commuting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if we substitute one morphism from the family of morphisms that make up the natural transformation with some other random morphism that has the same signature, all squares that have this morphism as a component would stop commuting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would result in something like an “almost-natural” transformation (e.g. an abstract function that reverses all lists, except lists of integers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the category of sets, where morphisms are functions i.e. mappings between values, it is enough to move just one arrow of just one of those values in order to make the transformation “unnatural” (e.g. a function which reverses all lists, but one specific list).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if can just gather a bunch of random morphisms, one for each object, that fit the criteria, we get what I would call a “perfectly unnatural transformation” (but this is my terminology).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, although they do exist, it is very hard to define non-natural transformations. For example, for categories that are infinite, there is no way to specify such “perfectly unnatural transformation” (ones where none of the squares commute) without resorting to randomness. And even transformations on finite categories, or the “semi-natural” transformations which we described above (the ones that include a single condition for a single value or type), are not possible to specify in some languages e.g. you can define such a transformation in Typescript, but not in Haskell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see why, let’s see what the type of a natural transformation is.&lt;/p&gt;\[\forall\ a.\ F a \to G a\]&lt;p&gt;The key is that the definition should be valid for all types a. For this reason, there is no way for us to specify a different arrows for different types, without resorting to type downcasting, which is not permitted in languages like Haskell (as it breaks the principle of parametricity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after we saw the definition of natural transformations, it is time to see the definition of natural transformations (and if you feel that the quality of the humour in this book is deteriorating, that’s only because things are getting serious).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s review again the commuting diagram that represents a natural transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diagram might prompt us into viewing natural transformations as some kind of “two-arrow functors” that have not one but two arrows coming from each of their morphisms — this notion, can be formalized, by using product categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, I just realized we never covered product categories… but don’t worry, we will cover them now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We haven’t covered product categories, however some pages ago, when we covered monoids and groups, we talked about the concept of a product group. The good news is that product categories are a generalization of product groups…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that you probably don’t remember much about product groups, as covered them briefly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t worry, we will do a more in-depth treatment now:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given two groups $G$ and $H$, whose sets of elements can also be denoted $G$ and $H$…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(in this example we use two boolean groups, which we visualize as the groups of horizontal and vertical rotation of a square)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…the product group of these two groups is a group that has the cartesian product of these two sets $G \times H$ as its set of elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what can the group operation of such a group be? Well, I would say that out of the few possible groups operations for this set that exist, this is the only operation that is natural (I didn’t intend to involve natural transformation at this section, but they really do appear everywhere). So, let’s try to derive the operation of this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know what a group operation is, in principle: A group operation combines two elements from the group into a third element i.e. it is a function with the following type signature:&lt;/p&gt;\[\circ : (A, A) \to A\]&lt;p&gt;or equivalently&lt;/p&gt;\[\circ : A \to A \to A\]&lt;p&gt;And for product groups, we said that the underlying set of the group (which we dubbed $A$ above) is a cartesian product of some other two sets which we dubbed $G$ and $H$. So, when we swap $A$ for $G \times H$ the definition becomes:&lt;/p&gt;\[\circ : G \times H \to G \times H \to G \times H\]&lt;p&gt;i.e. the group operation takes one pair of elements from $G$ and $H$ and another pair of elements from $G$ and $H$, only to return — guess what — a pair of elements $G$ and $H$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example. To avoid confusion, we take two totally different groups — the color-mixing group and the group of integers under addition. That would mean that a value of $G \times H$ would be a pair, containing a random color and a random number, and the operation would combine two combine two such pairs and produce another one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the operation must produce a pair, containing a number and a color. Furthermore, it would be good if it produces a number by using those two numbers, not just picking one at random, and likewise for colors. And furthermore, we want it to work not just for monoids of numbers and colors, but all other monoids that can be given to us. It is obvious that there is only one solution, to get the elements of the new pair by combining the elements of the pairs given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the operation of the product group of the two boolean groups which we presented earlier is the combination of the two operations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the general definition of the operation is the following ($g1$, $g2$ are elements of $G$ and $h1$ and $h2$ elements of $H$).&lt;/p&gt;\[(g1, h1) \circ (g2, h2) = ( (g1 \circ g2), (h1 \circ h2))\]&lt;p&gt;And that are product groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are back at tackling product categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we know what product groups are, and we know that groups are nothing but categories with just one object (and the group objects are the category’s morphisms, remember?), we are already almost there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a way to make a product category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take any two categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then take the set of all possible pairs of the objects of these categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, finally, we make a category out of that set by taking all morphisms coming from any of the two categories and replicate them to all pairs that feature some objects from their type signature, in the same way as we did for product groups (in this example, only one of the categories has morphisms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the product category of the two categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this section we are interested with the products of one particular category, namely the category we called $2$, containing two objects and one morphism (stylishly represented in black and white).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This category is the key to constructing a functor that is equivalent to a natural transformation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, given a product category of $2$ and some other category $C$…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…there exist a natural transformation between $C$ and the product category $2\times C$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this connection is two-way: any natural transformation from $C$ to some other category (call it $D$, as it is customary) can be represented as a functor $2 \times C \to D$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, if we have a natural transformations $\alpha : F \Rightarrow G$ (where $F: C \to D$ and $G: C \to D$), then, we also have a functor $2 \times C \to D$, such that if we take the subcategory of $2 \times C$ comprised of just those objects that have the $0$ object as part of the pair, and the morphisms between them, we get a functor that is equivalent to $F$, and if we consider the subcategory that contains $1$, then the functor is equivalent to $G$ (we write $\alpha(-,0)=F$ and $\alpha(-,1)=G$). Et voilà!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task 5: Show that the two definitions are equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective helps us realize that a natural transformation can be viewed as a collection of commuting squares. The source functor defines the left-hand side of each square, the target functor — the right-hand side, and the transformation morphisms join these two sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can even retrieve the structure of the source category of these functors, which (as categories are by definition structure and nothing more) is equivalent to retrieving the category itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural transformations are surely a different beast than normal morphisms and functors and so they don’t compose in the same way. However, they do compose and here we will show how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s first get one trivial definition out of the way: for each functor, we have the identity natural transformation (actually a natural isomorphism) between it and itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setup for composing natural transformations may look complicated the first time you see it: we need three categories $C$, $D$ and $E$ (just as composition of morphisms requires three objects). We need a total of four functors, distributed on two pairs, one pair of functors that goes from $C$ to $D$ and one that goes from $D$ to $E$ (so we can compose these two pairs of functors together, to get a new pair of functors that go $C \to E$). However, we will try to keep it simple and we will treat the natural transformation as a map from a morphism to a commuting square. As we showed above, this mapping already contains the two functors in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, let’s say that we have the natural transformation $\alpha$ involving the $C \to D$ functors (which we usually call $F$ and $G$).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what will happen if we have one more transformation $\bar\alpha$ involving the functors that go $D \to E$ (which are labelled $F’$ and $G’$)? Well, since a natural transformation maps each morphism to a square, and a square contains four morphisms (two projections by the two functors and two components of the transformation), a square would be mapped to four squares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by drawing two of them for each projection of the morphism in $C$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have to have two more squares, corresponding to the two morphisms that are the components of the $\alpha$ natural transformation. However, these morphisms connect the objects that are the target of the two functors, objects that we already have on our diagram, so we just have to draw the connections between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is an interesting structure which is sometimes visualized as a cube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, when we compose the commuting squares from the sides of the cube horizontally, we see that it contains not one, but two bigger commuting squares (they look like rectangles in this diagram), visualized in grey and red. Both of them connect morphisms $F’Ff$ and $G’Gf$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, there is a natural transformation between the composite functor $F’ \circ F : C \to E$ and $G’ \circ G : C \to E$ — a natural transformation that is usually marked $\bar\alpha \bullet \alpha$ (with a black dot).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task 6: Show that natural transformations indeed compose i.e. that if you have natural transformations $F’Ff \Rightarrow F’Gf$ and $F’Gf \Rightarrow G’Gf$ you have $F’Ff \Rightarrow G’Gf$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And an interesting special case of horizontal composition is horizontal composition involving the identity natural transformation: given a natural transformation $\bar\alpha$ involving functors with signature $D \to E$ and some functor with signature $F : C \to D$, we can take $\alpha$ to be the identity natural transformation between functor $F$ and itself and compose it with $\bar\alpha$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get a new natural transformation $\bar\alpha \bullet \alpha$, that is practically the same as the one we started with (i.e. the same as $\bar\alpha$) so what’s the deal? We just found a way to extend natural transformations, using functors: i.e we can use a functor with signature $C \to D$ to extend a $D \to E$ natural transformation and make it $C \to E$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task 7: Try to extend the natural transformation in the other direction (by taking $\bar\alpha$ to be identity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, this is how you compose natural transformations. It’s too bad that this is form of composition is different from the standard categorical composition. So, I guess natural transformations do not form a category, like we hoped they would…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, OK, there is actually another way of composing categories, which might actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recall that categorical composition involves three objects and two successive arrows between them. For vertical composition of natural transformations, we will need three (or more) functors with the same type signature, say $F, G, H: C \to D$ i.e. (same source and target category) and two successive natural transformations between those functors i.e. $\alpha: F \to G$ and $\beta: G \to H$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can combine each morphism of the natural transformation $\alpha$ (e.g. $a: F \to G$) and the corresponding morphism of the natural transformation $\beta$ (say $b:G \to H$) to get a new morphism, which we call $b \circ a : F \to H$ (the composition operator is the usual white circle, as opposed to the black one, which denotes horizontal composition). And the set of all such morphisms are precisely the components of a new natural transformation: $\beta \circ \alpha : F \to H$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we are approaching the end of the chapter, we will introduce our category and call it quits. To do that, we first introduce a more compressed notation for vertical composition of natural transformations (where they do indeed look vertical).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started this chapter by looking at category of sets and using internal diagrams, displaying the set elements as points and the sets/objects as collections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task 8: identify the function, the three functors, and the two natural transformations used in this diagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, we quickly passed to normal external diagrams, where objects are points and categories are collections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now we go one more level further, and show the category of categories, where categories are points and functors are morphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this notation, we display natural transformations as (double) arrows between morphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you can already see the new category that is formed: For each two categories (like $C$ and $D$ in this case), there exists a category which has functors for objects and natural transformations as morphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural transformations compose with vertical compositions, and, of course, the identity natural transformation is the identity morphism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vertical and horizontal composition of natural transformations are related to each other in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we have (as we had) two successive natural transformations, in the vertical sense, like $\alpha: F \to G$ and $\beta: G \to H$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And two successive ones, this time in horizontal sense e.g. $\bar\alpha: F’ \to G’$ and $\bar\beta: G’ \to H’$. (note that $\alpha$ has nothing to do with $\bar\alpha$ as $\beta$ has nothing to do with $\bar\beta$, we just call them that way to avoid using too many letters)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if the two pairs of natural transformations both start from the same category and the same functor, then the compositions of the two pairs of natural transformations obey the following law&lt;/p&gt;\[(β \circ α) \bullet (\bar β \circ \bar α) = (β \bullet \bar β) \circ (α \bullet \bar α)\]&lt;p&gt;Task 9: Draw the paths of the two compositions of the transformations (on the two sides of the equation) and ensure that they indeed lead to the same place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point you might be wondering the following (although statistically you are more likely to wonder what the heck is all this about): We know that all categories are objects of $Cat$, the category of small categories, in which functors play the role of morphisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, functors between given categories also form a category, under vertical composition. Which means that $Cat$ not only has (as any other category) morphisms between objects, but also has morphisms between morphisms. And furthermore, those two types of morphisms compose in this very interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what does that make of $Cat$? I don’t know, perhaps we can call natural transformations “2-morphisms” and $Cat$ is some kind of “2-category”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wait, actually it’s way too early for you to find out. We haven’t even covered limits…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why I only use Google sheets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To cut things short, always use the easiest solution to solve a particular problem and once that solution does not work for the business anymore reassess what the new requirements are and either try enhance the current solution or find an alternative that better solve the problem. In my case the easiest solution is often creating a new Google sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I entered the workforce about 9 months ago and my optimism for building new tools and services that help the small starting up business I work for has all vanished. I work in an environment that changes every 2 months or so, as my boss finds a new business venture she wants to enter. This has me starting and stopping quite a few projects that could have been solved in an afternoon with a quick Google Sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have listed a few examples below of some of the projects I have wasted time on instead of making a Google Sheet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I spent 2 months designing and making an admin panel to manage and track incoming cargo for the business. This panel was supposed to help the business categorise and better manage packages and customer data. This admin panel was used twice and never again. A Google Sheet could have been easily used for this and is currently being used for this task.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Three weeks were spent creating an MVP for a quote system that automatically calculated the duty and taxes for people ordering certain goods. Zimbabwean taxes and duties are often very complex and having our customers know exactly what to pay would create a better customer journey and make the process faster since we would not have to wait on our third party duty processing company to reply to us on every customer inquiry. In the end, we saw one of our competitors tax and duty breakdown table and we just copied it and put it in a Google Sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Spent 2 months researching, having meetings (often &amp;gt; 1hr long) and looking for a good CRM to use for the business. I would sit down compare and contrast different feature`s and prices for all the different CRMs we were looking into. We ended up using the free version of Oddo, that is not used that much anyway within the business. To my surprise a few weeks ago i noticed that Google Sheets has a CRM template built into it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that making a Google Sheet is the best solution to every problem but often times in my situation it is. I usually end up in situations were I never know the full scope of the problem until we start doing the actual work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not to say that we do not need to plan out a project. The team should discuss workflows and information they might need but until we start doing the actual work we do not know full scope of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the full scope of the problem is known then we can start creating or enhancing the solutions we have. This helps because you do not end up being stuck with an extra workload that in the best case does not require all the features you are adding and in the worst case spending time on a project that will fail. So it is in your best interest to use the most basic solution to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing the smallest and easiest solution to a problem as a way to get to know the full scope and then iterating after that if needs be is by far the best solution (for me).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some caveats to this approach, I know a few organisation that have a thousand row spreadsheets that keep track of all their business transactions and employee information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating a Google Sheet only works in situations were we do not know the full scope of the problem. Personally, I'm still new to this and learning when the best solution is making a Google Sheet or not. I just want to save people's time and effort and not have them build something that will never be used. But like all advice, think carefully about your own situation before committing a lot of time and effort especially in a business setting. It is perfectly fine for you to build useless programs and software in your spare time, that's the whole fun of it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens when something we enjoy doing that took effort becomes effortless? And what happens if that original effort was a foundation on which we saw value in ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If our efforts, in part, define us, then our efforts have intrinsic value. Our efforts may help us understand a position we want to occupy, an identity we carry, or an outlook we present. This value contributes to an internal economy of joy, self-respect, fulfillment, happiness. When effortful things become effortless, what becomes of our position in these economies?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have a few questions here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know someone who spent a part of their adult life taking beautiful photographs, developing them by hand, framing them, cataloging them. Along came the ubiquity of digital cameras and smartphones, and "film" became infinitely available. Offhandedly, one day, this person mentioned that with the proliferation of smart phone cameras, and the ease with which one can take photos, they had found that some days their desire to continue was diminishing, and their work had lost meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technology has a history of making effortful things effortless, and there is sometimes a hidden loss in that advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figure people are continually being left behind in a similar manner day-to-day. Technology continues advancing (for the most part), and more things that remain effortful will become effortless. And "we" (ie, the populations who can afford to sit around and have crises of identity on these topics) will be further pushed to re-evaluate certain parts of our definitions of self.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For myself, in the last 10 years, my work of writing code has largely defined what I do with my working time. Now I experience large swaths of that work being created and done by AI (sometimes amazingly well, sometimes poorly), and I find myself thinking of the photographer above. It's not my wish that people can't have access to a more effortless way to write code, but I feel a strange sadness that there is less left to the act of the craft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have had this note in a draft state for several weeks now because I still can’t quite come to terms with how I’m feeling about things. There are so many nuances and unclear thoughts rolling around in my head about this shift. I think the only thing that is vaguely clear is that none of this would matter if making money wasn’t at play. If I was just writing code, (or taking film photographs) for fun in my free time because I enjoyed it, well, I don’t think I’d be feeling so conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being paid to work and presenting my capacities through my craft is an exchange that I have been able to derive value from in its effortful-ness. Often times I've worked on utterly boring tasks that I would have loved to have a tool that could automate. But I didn't. And even in those menial moments I did derive some pleasure in my capacities. Of course, when it came to the real challenges, that was where I felt a pleasure and value in putting forth effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a consultant, I work in a lot of different places, often for brief stints of time. And at many of these places, I see a large push, top-down, to encourage people to use AI. These employees, previously having entered an employment agreement where their capacities and experience would be exchanged for money, are now being asked that their abilities be augmented. In this way, the level continues to skew toward privileging production, often without understanding and people using their own perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I see sentiments similar to mine, I often see reactions where people say that AI is simply a tool and that you must learn to use it and incorporate it into your toolbox. That's fine. That's well and good. But all I'm trying to say here is that I feel a lack and a loss for something. I don't understand it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The title of this post, our efforts, in part, define us, is just a phrase that popped into my head. I'm not really sure if I even believe it or if I've fully fleshed out this single statement. But some part of it rings true to me. I wonder what will happen to us and our efforts. Will we be driven into further niches that are effortful, that we can derive value from? Will we become vague blobs that are formless, ill-defined, and despondent?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this presupposes a few things —that one can (and/or should) aim to derive value from work, that a meaningful identity is constructed by doing effortful things, that people generally are happier when they can use their skills and experiences to make something. And what’s more, there is a fine-line here between glorifying people with experience deriving value, and sounding like a shitty gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will continue working for various clients. I suspect I will continue hearing leadership push AI on employees. And I will continue observing how people respond to this. Of course, for many people a job is just a job, as they say, and they'll do whatever they can to get it done more quickly (or work several jobs at once). Those very same people might find more value from their efforts now that AI is making their jobs easier. They can turn to better supporting their family, following other interests outside of work, finding other meaningful things, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But at this time, I don't really see how this won’t further trample people’s spirits in the realm of work, unless we also reshape our expectations of work itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it worth the effort?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;❦&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;FlowSynx: Orchestrate Declarative, Plugin-Driven DAG Workflows on .NET&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seamless Workflow Automation—Declarative, Extensible, and Fully Controllable. Turn complex processes into maintainable, auditable, and transparent workflows that adapt to your business needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is the FlowSynx?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mission of FlowSynx is clear: deliver a lightweight, extensible, and developer-friendly engine that adapts to diverse domains—from data engineering and DevOps to healthcare, finance, and enterprise integrations. It strikes the perfect balance between no-code simplicity and full-code flexibility, allowing teams to tailor workflows precisely to their needs through a modular, plugin-driven architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At its core, FlowSynx leverages a micro-kernel design, cleanly separating orchestration logic from functional extensions. This decoupled architecture allows you to dynamically load, develop, or replace plugins without disrupting system stability—making FlowSynx highly customizable, maintainable, and easy to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FlowSynx features and capabilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Plugin-Based Extensibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each functional component in FlowSynx—from task definitions and runtime behaviors to integration endpoints and authentication providers—is treated as a plugin. Users can develop custom plugins using well-defined interfaces and register them with the system, enabling FlowSynx to adapt to specific business rules, protocols, or environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cross-Platform Execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FlowSynx is designed to run seamlessly across major platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Additionally, it offers containerized deployment via Docker, making it ideal for integration into modern DevOps pipelines, Kubernetes environments, or hybrid cloud architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Workflow Definition and Execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workflows in FlowSynx are defined as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using JSON or DSL representations. These workflows support conditional logic, parallel execution, error handling, input/output mapping, and custom execution contexts—enabling advanced control flow with traceability and fault tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Command-Line Interface (CLI)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive CLI tool is included for managing workflows, invoking executions, debugging tasks, monitoring logs, and interacting with the system at a low level. This is ideal for scripting, batch jobs, and infrastructure automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Software Development Kit (SDK)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FlowSynx provides a full-featured SDK for programmatic access. Developers can use the SDK to integrate workflow functionality into their applications, define dynamic workflows at runtime, fetch execution results, and implement plugin hosting strategies. The SDK is structured with clean architecture principles and is available in .NET, with planned bindings for other ecosystems via REST APIs or language bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;REST-API Accessibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exposes core functionality through a well-documented, versioned RESTful API that enables secure remote access and seamless integration across platforms and programming languages. The API supports standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), offers comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation, and includes authentication, rate limiting, and error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness, scalability, and ease of use for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Console: Web-UI Management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FlowSynx Console provides a modern, browser-based interface for workflow management. Users can visually design, configure, and monitor workflows, review execution logs, and manage plugins directly from the web UI. With real-time dashboards, drag-and-drop workflow editing, and secure multi-user access, the Console simplifies collaboration and operational oversight across distributed teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Authentication and Security&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FlowSynx includes pluggable authentication support, enabling integration with modern identity providers such as OAuth2, OpenID Connect (e.g., Keycloak), as well as support for basic and token-based authentication. Security policies can be enforced per user, per plugin, and per workflow execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Logging, Monitoring, and Auditing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All workflow executions and plugin interactions are fully traceable. The system provides structured logging, execution history, and audit trail support for compliance and observability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Standalone and Containerized Modes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FlowSynx can operate as a lightweight local service for single-user or single-machine scenarios, or it can scale horizontally through distributed orchestration models—enabling large-scale, multi-tenant execution across clusters or cloud-native infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Trigger-Based Workflow Execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automatically launch workflows in response to specific events like file uploads, API calls, or scheduled intervals. Triggers eliminate manual intervention by monitoring conditions and instantly activating corresponding task flows, ensuring real-time, event-driven automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Approval&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrate human decision points into automated workflows with Human-in-the-Loop Approval. This feature pauses execution until an authorized user manually approves or rejects a pending task. Ideal for scenarios requiring compliance checks, risk assessment, or business validation, it adds a layer of control and accountability within otherwise automated processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Flexible Error Handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure workflow resilience with configurable error-handling strategies that define how failures are managed during execution. Choose from Retry, Skip, or Abort behaviors to match the criticality of each task. Fine-tune retry behavior with customizable policies, including maximum retries, initial delay, and backoff strategies such as Fixed, Linear, Exponential, or Jitter, enabling intelligent recovery from transient failures without manual intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Architecture overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Intraction tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CLI Interface: Command-line tools for interacting with the FlowSynx system, enabling workflow management and execution from terminals.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;REST API Gateway: Provides secure, HTTP/HTTPS RESTful APIs to integrate with external systems, allowing remote workflow control and status querying.&lt;/item&gt;
