  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October, I reported two security issues to Okta’s auth0/nextjs-auth0 project, here and here. The latter bug, an oauth parameter injection, allows for a range of types of abuse, like scoping tokens for unintended services, setting &lt;code&gt;redirect_uri&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scope&lt;/code&gt; to arbitrary values to leak tokens, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The patch was simple enough, so I opened a PR:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;diff --git a/src/server/helpers/with-page-auth-required.ts b/src/server/helpers/with-page-auth-required.ts

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All’s well that ends well, right? Obviously, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PR, 3 weeks later, was closed by the maintainer, an auth0 (an Okta company) employee, with the following comment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This change is superseded by #2413. This was done to ensure that commits are signed. Orignal contribution history has been preserved. Hence closing this PR now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm, let’s take a look at that PR:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;auth0/nextjs-auth0 #2413&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm. That patch looks familiar. And who is Simen Olsen?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pushing back on the attribution error, I replied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;history has been preserved&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;no it hasn’t. I don’t know who “Simen A. W. Olsen my@simen.io” is but it isn’t me and my commit here doesn’t reference that name or email address at all. Was it ai generated or something?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the answer was: yes. It was AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hi @MegaManSec I sincerely apologize for this attribution error.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Can confirm that an AI workflow was used to created the rebased commit, which got confused with OP details. I’ve added a correction to #2413, and will ensure the changelog is updated.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thank you for calling this out, we’ll make sure this doesn’t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only did the maintainer state the above, they also used AI to generate the response! In a now-deleted comment, they clearly used some AI to respond to my complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;auth0/nextjs-auth0 #2413’s now-deleted comment&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the classic ChatGPT “you are absolutely correct”, it’s pretty frustrating that this developer used AI to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Take my report/PR and commit it themselves.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Used AI to commit it, removing my attribution.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Used AI to “apologise” for using AI, then stated that “it won’t happen again” – (yeah right; please provide a detailed explanation how you’re going to ensure that, when clearly a 1-line code change is too much for your AI to handle without breaking).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Refused to fix the commit to remove the invalid / AI-generated-slop details, and add back mine.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, asking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I would appreciate force-pushing a fix for the commit to properly include my information in the commit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was told that they cannot change it. That seems like a copyright infringement to me: taking somebody else’s code, then changing the author’s name?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I really find the most interesting is really how this AI slop even came to be. I cannot find any reference to the email address “my@simen.io” anywhere online. On GitHub, the only reference to this email address is from the nextjs-auth0 PR. Simen Olsen has never contributed to any of the nextjs-auth0 repositories as far as I can tell (searching &lt;code&gt;org:auth0 author:simenandre&lt;/code&gt; on GitHub), and that doesn’t even seem to be their real email address. so was this some type of ai hallucination? And why? The code change was tiny. I just totally don’t get it: I have literally never had any AI tooling fail like this and come up with some other person’s (fake) contact details. It’s simply absurd; are auth0’s engineers using some extremely (extremely) low quality local model or something? If ChatGPT failed like this for me even once every thousand times, I would simply never use it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, at the time of writing this, the auth0/nextjs-auth0 maintainer, Tushar Pandey, who made all of these mistakes, has not fixed attribution mistake in the commit history. In addition to this, that first bug, which allows for arbitrary account hijacking in this software, has been fixed after 3 weeks, with new versions of the nextjs-auth0 software released, but Okta’s security people stating that “unless you create a video abusing this vulnerability, we aren’t going to accept this as a security issue” – LMAO; “yeah, it’s a vulnerability, we fixed in the code, it can be used to takeover accounts, but you need to create a video”. Hilarious. That’s just another case to add to my list of hilarious problems related to reporting security issue, that my next post will document.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The f32 is an ultra-compact ESP32 development board designed to mount directly behind a USB-C receptacle. The PCB measures just 9.85 mm x 8.45 mm. It's powered by the ESP32-C3FH4 microcontroller and was created primarily for research and as a bit of a stress test for the ESP32, since it intentionally ignores many standard design guidelines. There's only one exposed GPIO and it is connected to an onboard LED, so most of the development on here would be more catered for wifi/web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test the f32 an example application was created that users can interact with. The application turns the f32 into a captive portal so when it's powered on it will show up as an open access point that the user can select from available WiFi networks. The user is then automatically sent to the f32's control page where they can interact with some of its basic functionality such as turning on an LED or scanning for surrounding WiFi networks. There's also an "About" page that provides a small overview of the device. Below are some screenshots and a gif of interacting with the device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially the f32 didn't seem to want to work. I couldn't get it to connect to any networks or broadcast it's own network. Im 100% sure this is due to the poor antenna circuitry or lack of, but I did manage to get it functional after adding an additional tiny antenna onto the chip antenna as seen in the picture below. This was just a piece of bent wire soldered to the end lead and floating above the first lead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I don't have fancy signal testing equipment I relied on some manual testing such as seeing if I can still connect to the device and control the LED. In a clear line of sight test with the f32 placed about 3ft off the ground I was able to connect and perform scans/control the LED at roughly 120ft! This can be seen in my highly necessary depiction below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PCB was designed using DipTrace and manufactured by PCBWay with a board thickness of 0.6mm, min hole size of 0.2mm, and min track/spacing of 4/4mil. At the time of making this it only cost $10.75 for 5 boards shipped! That still blows my mind. PCBWay does also offer assembly services, but I chose to assemble this at home and suffer a bit. This took a bit of trial and error with such small parts, but I decided the best way for me was to ditch the stencil and make flux my best friend. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools &amp;amp; parts used:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SRA Solder 135 Rosin Paste Soldering Flux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thin Kester Solder 63/37&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pinecil Soldering Iron&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fine Soldering Iron Tip&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rework Station&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Soldering Hotplate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Digital Microscope or Jewelers Loupe&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fine Tip Tweezer (DON'T cheap out on tweezers! A good tweezer is a game changer)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steps to building one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send the gerber file &lt;code&gt;f32_gerber.zip&lt;/code&gt;found in the&lt;code&gt;hardware&lt;/code&gt;folder to PCBWay with the specs mentioned above.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Order the components noted in &lt;code&gt;f32_bom.pdf&lt;/code&gt;. These parts can be found on both DigiKey and Mouser except the antenna. I don't remember where I had originally ordered them, but I believe they are CrossAir CA-C03.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;** Tip: Always order more than you need, especially with components as small as these.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean the pcb really well with 99% Alcohol.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starting with the top side (Antenna side) apply a thin layer of soldering flux across the entire board using a tooth pick.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using a soldering iron with a fine tip apply some solder to the tip and then go across all the exposed pads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean the board again with 99% alcohol and verify all the pads on this side have some solder on them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apply another thin layer of flux to the same side.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using tweezers and a microscope/loupe start placing the top components following the reference guide &lt;code&gt;f32_reference.pdf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;** Tip: I found placing the larger components last helps.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gently move the board onto the soldering hotplate or use the rework station to heat the solder back up and watch the components wiggle into place.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repeat with Bottom side. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bottom side must be done using a rework hot air gun, not possible with hotplate.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Place the USB-C receptacle last.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean entire board using alcohol and a fine toothbrush.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After assembly you can use ESP-IDF VSCode extension or Arduino and upload whatever you'd like to the board or you can upload my example application using the steps below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure you are in the base directory of this repo and have access to &lt;code&gt;esptool.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure your &lt;code&gt;esptool&lt;/code&gt;version is at&lt;code&gt;v4&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run the following command replacing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PORT&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;with whichever port the device is connected to i.e. on Windows typically something like&lt;code&gt;COM5&lt;/code&gt;or on Linux&lt;code&gt;/dev/ttyACM0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;esptool.py -p &amp;lt;PORT&amp;gt; -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32c3 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 2MB 0x0 firmware/bootloader.bin 0x10000 firmware/f32_internal.bin 0x8000 firmware/partition-table.bin 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well that's up to you to decide. I started this project for some personal research and also a fun learning experience. I had always wanted a project that used 01005 components ever since I had accidentally ordered some years ago. Whatever you choose to use it for, please note that this design intentionally neglects several fundamental components such as proper decoupling capacitors, an antenna matching circuit, USB termination resistors, and likely more. It does function, but it’s intentionally bare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expose more GPIOs on the sides of the PCB to make it a mountable PCB.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improve antenna circuitry.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, fun coincidence, the ESP32 chip, the antenna, and the LDO all are "C3" models!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Computation and Language&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 19 Nov 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for large language models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;p&gt;Chrono Divide is a fan-made project which aims to recreate the original "Red Alert 2" from the "Command &amp;amp; Conquer" series using web technologies. The result is a game client that runs in your web browser, with no additional plugins or applications installed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project initially started out as an experiment and was meant to prove that it was possible to have a fully working, cross-platform RTS game running in a web browser. Now, with a playable version already available, the end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla "Red Alert 2" engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game client now supports fully working multiplayer, all original maps and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Nano Banana Pro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a few months ago we released Nano Banana, our Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model. From restoring old photos to generating mini figurines, Nano Banana was a big step in image editing that empowered casual creators to express their creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image), our new state-of-the art image generation and editing model. Built on Gemini 3 Pro, Nano Banana Pro uses Gemini’s state-of-the-art reasoning and real-world knowledge to visualize information better than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Nano Banana Pro helps you bring any idea or design to life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nano Banana Pro can help you visualize any idea and design anything - from prototypes, to representing data as infographics, to turning handwritten notes into diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Nano Banana Pro, now you can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generate more accurate, context-rich visuals based on enhanced reasoning, world knowledge and real-time information&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Gemini 3’s advanced reasoning, Nano Banana Pro doesn’t just create beautiful images, it also helps you create more helpful content. You can get accurate educational explainers to learn more about a new subject, like context-rich infographics and diagrams based on the content you provide or facts from the real world. Nano Banana Pro can also connect to Google Search's vast knowledge base to help you create a quick snapshot for a recipe or visualize real-time information like weather or sports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An infographic of the common house plant, String of Turtles, with information on origins, care essentials and growth patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Create an infographic about this plant focusing on interesting information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step-by-step infographic for making Elaichi Chai (cardamom tea), demonstrating the ability to visualize recipes and real-world information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: Create an infographic that shows how to make elaichi chai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used Nano Banana Pro to pull in real-time weather via Search grounding to build a pop-art infographic.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to identify AI-generated images in the Gemini app&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe it’s critical to know when an image is AI-generated. This is why all media generated by Google’s tools are embedded with our imperceptible SynthID digital watermark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we are putting a powerful verification tool directly in consumers’ hands: you can now upload an image into the Gemini app and simply ask if it was generated by Google AI, thanks to SynthID technology. We are starting with images, but will expand to audio and video soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to SynthID, we will maintain a visible watermark (the Gemini sparkle) on images generated by free and Google AI Pro tier users, to make images even more easy to detect as Google AI-generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognizing the need for a clean visual canvas for professional work, we will remove the visible watermark from images generated by Google AI Ultra subscribers and within the Google AI Studio developer tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find out more about how we’re increasing transparency in AI content with SynthID in our blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve now had humans in space for 25 continuous years, a feat that made the news last week and one that must have caused a few toasts to be made aboard the International Space Station. This is a marker of sorts, and we’ll have to see how long it will continue, but the notion of a human presence in orbit will gradually seem to be as normal as a permanent presence in, say, Antarctica. But what a short time 25 years is when weighed against our larger ambitions, which now take in Mars and will continue to expand as our technologies evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve yet to claim even a century of space exploration, what with Gagarin’s flight occurring only 65 years ago, and all of this calls to mind how cautiously we should frame our assumptions about civilizations that may be far older than ourselves. We don’t know how such species would develop, but it’s chastening to realize that when SETI began, it was utterly natural to look for radio signals, given how fast they travel and how ubiquitous they were on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, though, things have changed significantly since Frank Drake’s pioneering work at Green Bank. We’re putting out a lot less energy in the radio frequency bands, as technology gradually shifted toward cable television and Internet connectivity. The discovery paradigm needs to grow lest we become anthropocentric in our searches, and the hunt for technosignatures reflects the realization that we may not know what to expect from alien technologies, but if we see one in action, we may at least be able to realize that it is artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if we receive a message, what then? We’ve spent a lot of time working on how information in a SETI signal could be decoded, and have coded messages of our own, as for example the famous Hercules message of 1974. Sent from Arecibo, the message targeted the Hercules cluster some 25,000 light years away, and was obviously intended as a demonstration of what might later develop with nearby stars if we ever tried to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But whether we’re looking at data from radio telescopes, optical surveys of entire galaxies or even old photographic plates, that question of anthropocentrism still holds. Digging into it in a provocative way is a new paper from Cameron Brooks and Sara Walker (Arizona State) and colleagues. In a world awash with papers on SETI and Fermi and our failure to detect traces of ETI, it’s a bit of fresh air. Here the question becomes one of recognition, and whether or not we would identify a signal as alien if we saw it, putting aside the question of deciphering it. Interested in structure and syntax in non-human communication, the authors start here on Earth with the common firefly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that seems an odd choice, consider that this is a non-human entity that uses its own methods to communicate with its fellow creatures. The well studied firefly is known to produce its characteristic flashes in ways that depend upon its specific species. This turns out to be useful in mating season when there are two imperatives: 1) to find a mate of the same species in an environment containing other firefly species, and 2) to minimize the possibility of being identified by a predator. All this is necessary because according to one recent source, there are over 2600 species in the world, with more still being discovered. The need is to communicate against a very noisy background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image: Can the study of non-human communication help us design new SETI strategies? In this image, taken in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, we see the flash pattern of Photinus carolinus, a sequence of five to eight distinct flashes, followed by an eight-second pause of darkness, before the cycle repeats. Initially, the flashing may appear random, but as more males join in, their rhythms align, creating a breathtaking display of pulsating light throughout the forest. Credit: National Park Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fireflies use a form of signaling, one that is a recognized field of study within entomology, well analyzed and considered as a mode of communications between insects that enhances species reproduction as well as security. The evolution of these firefly flash sequences has been simulated over multiple generations. If fireflies can communicate against their local background using optical flashes, how would that communication be altered with an astrophysical background, and what can this tell us about structure and detectability?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by the example of the firefly, what Brooks and Walker are asking is whether we can identify structural properties within such signals without recourse to semantic content, mathematical symbols or other helpfully human triggers for comprehension. In the realm of optical SETI, for example, how much would an optical signal have to contrast with the background stars in its direction so that it becomes distinguishable as artificial?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a question for optical SETI, but the principles the authors probe are translatable to other contexts where discovery is made against various backgrounds. The paper constructs a model of an evolved signal that stands out against the background of the natural signals generated by pulsars. Pulsars are a useful baseline because they look so artifical. Their 1967 discovery was met with a flurry of interest because they resembled nothing we had seen in nature up to that time. Pulsars produce a bright signal that is easy to detect at interstellar distances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If pulsars are known to be natural phenomena, what might have told us if they were not? Looking for the structure of communications is highly theoretical work, but no more so than the countless papers discussing the Fermi question or explaining why SETI has found no sign of ETI. The authors pose the issue this way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…this evolutionary problem faced by fireflies in densely packed swarming environments provides an opportunity to study how an intelligent species might evolve signals to identify its presence against a visually noisy astrophysical environment, using a non-human species as the model system of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paper is put together using data from 3734 pulsars from the Australia National Telescope Facility (ATNF). The pulse profiles of these pulsars are the on-off states similar to the firefly flashes. The goal is to produce a series of optical flashes that is optimized to communicate against background sources, taking into account similarity to natural phenomena and trade-offs in energy cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus we have a thought experiment in ‘structure-driven’ principles. More from the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our aim is to motivate approaches that reduce anthropocentric bias by drawing on different communicative strategies observed within Earth’s biosphere. Such perspectives broaden the range of ETI forms we can consider and leverage a more comprehensive understanding of life on Earth to better conceptualize the possible modes of extraterrestrial communication… Broadening the foundations of our communication model, by drawing systematically from diverse taxa and modalities, would yield a more faithful representation of Earth’s biocommunication and increase the likelihood of success, with less anthropocentric searches, and more insights into deeper universalities of communication between species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authors filter the initial dataset down to a subset of pulsars within 5 kpc of Earth and compute mean period and duty cycle for each. In other words, they incorporate the rotation of the pulsar and the fraction in which each pulse is visible. They compute a ‘cost function’ analyzing similarity cost – how similar is the artificial signal to the background – and an energy cost, meaning the less frequent the pulses, the less energy expended. The terms are a bit confusing, but similarity cost refers to how much an artificial signal resembles a background pulsar signal, while energy cost refers to how long the signal is ‘on.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you’re an ETI trying to stand out against a background field of pulsars, the calculations here produce a signal background period of 24.704 seconds and a duty cycle of ~0.004 (meaning that the signal is ‘on’ for 0.4 percent of the period). Such signals appear at the edge of the pulsar distribution – they would be signals that stand out by being relatively rare and also brief in contrast to the rest of the pulsar population. They would, in other words, serve as the optimal beacon for ETI attempting to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spare you the math, which in any case is beyond my pay grade. But the point is this: A civilization trying to get our attention while broadcasting from a pulsar background could do so with a signal that has a long pulsar period (tens of seconds) and a low duty cycle. This would be sufficient to produce a signal that becomes conspicuous to observers. Now we can think about generalizing all this. The pulsar background is one of many out of which a possible signal could be detected, and the principles can be extended beyond the optical into other forms of SETI. The broad picture is identifying a signal against a background, proceeding by identifying the factors specific to each background studied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any time we are trying to distinguish an intentional signal, then, we need to optimize – in any signaling medium – the traits leading to detectability. Signals can be identified by their structural properties without any conception of their content as long as they rise above the noise of the background. Back to the fireflies: The paper is pointing out that non-human signaling can operate solely on a structure designed to stand out against background noise, with no semantic content. An effective signal need not resemble human thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember, this is more or less a thought experiment, but it is one that suggests that cross-disciplinary research may yield interesting ways of interpreting astrophysical data in search of signs of artificiality. On the broader level, the concept reminds us how to isolate a signal from whatever background we are studying and identify it as artificial through factors like duty cycle and period. The choice of background varies with the type of SETI being practiced. Ponder infrared searches for waste heat against various stellar backgrounds or more ‘traditional’ searches needing to distinguish various kinds of RF phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how the study of non-human species on Earth contributes to future detectability methods. Are there characteristics of dolphin communication that can be mined for insights? Examples in the song of birds?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paper is Brooks et al., “A Firefly-inspired Model for Deciphering the Alien,” available as a preprint.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The 2025 Go Cryptography State of the Union&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This past August, I delivered my traditional Go Cryptography State of the Union talk at GopherCon US 2025 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It goes into everything that happened at the intersection of Go and cryptography over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can watch the video (with manually edited subtitles, for my fellow subtitles enjoyers) or read the transcript below (for my fellow videos not-enjoyers).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The annotated transcript below was made with Simon Willison’s tool. All pictures were taken around Rome, the Italian contryside, and the skies of the Northeastern United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Annotated transcript&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my annual performance review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are going to talk about all of the stuff that we did in the Go cryptography world during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I say "we," it doesn't mean just me, it means me, Roland Shoemaker, Daniel McCarney, Nicola Morino, Damien Neil, and many, many others, both from the Go team and from the Go community that contribute to the cryptography libraries all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to do this work at Google, and I now do it as an independent as part of and leading Geomys, but we'll talk about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we talk about the Go cryptography standard libraries, we talk about all of those packages that you use to build secure applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's what we make them for. We do it to provide you with encryption and hashes and protocols like TLS and SSH, to help you build secure applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main headlines of the past year:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We shipped post quantum key exchanges, which is something that you will not have to think about and will just be solved for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have solved FIPS 140, which some of you will not care about at all and some of you will be very happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the thing I'm most proud of: we did all of this while keeping an excellent security track record, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an update to something you've seen last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's the list of vulnerabilities in the Go cryptography packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don't assign a severity—because it's really hard, instead they're graded on the "Filippo's unhappiness score."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It goes shrug, oof, and ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time goes from bottom to top, and you can see how as time goes by things have been getting better. People report more things, but they're generally more often shrugs than oofs and there haven't been ouches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More specifically, we haven't had any oof since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We didn't have any Go-specific oof since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I say Go-specific, I mean: well, sometimes the protocol is broken, and as much as we want to also be ahead of that by limiting complexity, you know, sometimes there's nothing you can do about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we haven't had ouches since 2019. I'm very happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if this sounds a little informal, I'm also happy to report that we had the first security audit by a professional firm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trail of Bits looked at all of the nuts and bolts of the Go cryptography standard library: primitives, ciphers, hashes, assembly implementations. They didn't look at the protocols, which is a lot more code on top of that, but they did look at all of the foundational stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I'm happy to say that they found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two of a kind t-shirts, for me and Roland Shoemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is easy though to maintain a good security track record if you never add anything, so let's talk about the code we did add instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, post-quantum key exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talked about post-quantum last year, but as a very quick refresher:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post-quantum cryptography is about the future. We are worried about quantum computers that might exist… 5-50 (it's a hell of a range) years from now, and that might break all of asymmetrical encryption. (Digital signatures and key exchanges.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post-quantum cryptography runs on classical computers. It's cryptography that we can do now that resists future quantum computers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post-quantum cryptography is fast, actually. If you were convinced that for some reason it was slow, that's a common misconception.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;However, post-quantum cryptography is large. Which means that we have to send a lot more bytes on the wire to get the same results.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we focused on post-quantum key exchange because the key exchange defends against the most urgent risk, which is that somebody might be recording connections today, keeping them saved on some storage for the next 5-50 years and then use the future quantum computers to decrypt those sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm happy to report that we now have ML-KEM, which is the post-quantum key exchange algorithm selected by the NIST competition, an international competition run in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use it directly from the crypto/mlkem standard library package starting in Go 1.24, but you're probably not gonna do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, you're probably going to just use crypto/tls, which by default now uses a hybrid of X25519 and ML-KEM-768 for all connections with other systems that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why hybrid? Because this is new cryptography. So we are still a little worried that somebody might break it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was one that looked very good and had very small ciphertext, and we were all like, “yes, yes, that's good, that's good.” And then somebody broke it on a laptop. It was very annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're fairly confident in lattices. We think this is the good one. But still, we are taking both the old stuff and the new stuff, hashing them together, and unless you have both a quantum computer to break the old stuff and a mathematician who broke the new stuff, you're not breaking the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;crypto/tls can now negotiate that with Chrome and can negotiate that with other Go 1.24+ applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only that, we also removed any choice you had in ordering of key exchanges because we think we know better than you and— that didn't come out right, uh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;… because we assume that you actually want us to make those kind of decisions, so as long as you don't turn it off, we will default to post-quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can still turn it off. But as long as you don't turn it off, we'll default to the post-quantum stuff to keep your connection safe from the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same stuff with x/crypto/ssh. Starting in v0.38.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH does the same thing, they just put X25519 and ML-KEM-768 in a different order, which you would think doesn't matter—and indeed it doesn't matter—but there are rules where "no, no, no, you have to put that one first." And the other rule says "no, you have to put that one first." It's been a whole thing. I'm tired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSH supports it, so if you connect to a recent enough version of OpenSSH, that connection is post-quantum and you didn't have to do anything except update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but you said key exchanges and digital signatures are broken. What about the latter?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, key exchanges are urgent because of the record-now-decrypt-later problem, but unless the physicists that are developing quantum computers also develop a time machine, they can't use the QC to go back in time and use a fake signature today. So if you're verifying a signature today, I promise you it's not forged by a quantum computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a lot more time to figure out post-quantum digital signatures. But if we can, why should we not start now? Well, it's different. Key exchange, we knew what hit we had to take. You have to do a key exchange, you have to do it when you start the connection, and ML-KEM is the algorithm we have, so we're gonna use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signatures, we developed a lot of protocols like TLS, SSH, back when it was a lot cheaper to put signatures on the wire. When you connect to a website right now, you get five signatures. We can't send you five 2KB blobs every time you connect to a website. So we are waiting to give time to protocols to evolve, to redesign things with the new trade-offs in mind of signatures not being cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are kind of slow rolling intentionally the digital signature side because it's both not as urgent and not as ready to deploy. We can't do the same “ta-da, it's solved for you” show because signatures are much harder to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's talk about another thing that I had mentioned last year, which is FIPS 140.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FIPS 140 is a US government regulation for how to do cryptography. It is a list of algorithms, but it's not just a list of algorithms. It's also a list of rules that the modules have to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is a module?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, a module used to be a thing you would rack. All the rules are based on the idea that it's a thing you can rack. Then the auditor can ask “what is the module’s boundary?” And you're like, “this shiny metal box over here." And, you know, that works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people ask those questions of libraries, though, I do get a little mad every time. Like, what are the data input ports of your library? Ports. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's an interesting thing to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To comply with FIPS 140 in Go, up to now, you had to use an unsupported GOEXPERIMENT, which would replace all of the Go cryptography standard library, all of the stuff I'm excited about, with the BoringCrypto module, which is a FIPS 140 module developed by the BoringSSL folks. We love the BoringSSL folks, but that means using cgo, and we do not love cgo. It has memory safety issues, it makes cross-compilation difficult, it’s not very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the list of algorithms and platforms of BoringCrypto is tailored to the needs of BoringSSL and not to the needs of the Go community, and their development cycle doesn't match our development cycle: we don't decide when that module gets validated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of memory safety, I lied a little. Trail of Bits did find one vulnerability. They found it in Go+BoringCrypto, which was yet another reason to try to push away from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we've got now the FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only is it native Go, it's actually just a different name for the internal Go packages that all the regular Go cryptography package use for the FIPS 140 algorithms. We just moved them into their own little bubble so that when they ask us “what is the module boundary” we can point at those packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there's a runtime mode which enables some of the self-tests and slow stuff that you need for compliance. It also tells crypto/tls not to negotiate stuff that's not FIPS, but aside from that, it doesn't change any observable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We managed to keep everything working exactly the same: you don't import a different package, you don't do anything different, your applications just keep working the same way. We're very happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, you can at compile time select a GOFIPS140 frozen module, which is just a zip file of the source of the module as it was back when we submitted it for validation, which is a compliance requirement sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, that means we have to be forward compatible with future versions of Go, even for internal packages, which was a little spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can read more in the upstream FIPS 140-3 docs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be surprised to find out that using a FIPS 140 algorithm from a FIPS 140 module is not actually enough to be FIPS 140 compliant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS 140 module also has to be tested for that specific algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we did is we just tested them all, so you can use any FIPS 140 algorithm without worrying about whether it's tested in our module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I say we tested them all, I mean that some of them we tested with four different names. NIST calls HKDF alternatively SP 800-56C two-step KDF, SP 800-133 Section 6.3 CKG, SP 800-108 Feedback KDF, and Implementation Guidance D.P OneStepNoCounter KDF (you don't wanna know). It has four different names for the same thing. We just tested it four times, it's on the certificate, you can use it whatever way you want and it will be compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you use a FIFS 140 algorithm from a FIPS 140 module that was tested for the algorithm it's still not enough because it has to run on a platform that was tested as part of the validation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we tested on a lot of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of them were paid for by various Fortune 100s that had an interest in them getting tested, but some of them had no sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really wanted to solve this problem for everyone, once and for all, so Geomys just paid for all the FreeBSD, macOS, even Windows testing so that we could say “run it on whatever and it's probably going to be compliant.” (Don't quote me on that.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did we test on that many machines? Well, you know, we have this sophisticated data center…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Um, no. No, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got a bunch of stuff shipped to my place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's my NAS now. It's an Ampere Altra Q64-22, sixty-four arm64 cores, and yep, it's my NAS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I tested it on, you know, this sophisticated arm64 macOS testing platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then on the Windows one, which is my girlfriend's laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then the arm one, which was my router.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently I own an EdgeRouter now? It's sitting in the data center which is totally not my kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was all a very serious and regimented thing, and all of it is actually recorded, in recorded sessions with the accredited laboratories, so all this is now on file with the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might or might not be surprised to hear that the easiest way to meet the FIPS 140 requirements is not to exceed them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's annoying and a problem of FIPS 140 in general: if you do what everybody else does, which is just clearing the bar, nobody will ask questions, so there’s a strong temptation to lower security in FIPS 140 mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We just refused to accept that. Instead, we figured out complex stratagems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, for randomness, the safest thing to do is to just take randomness from the kernel every time you need it. The kernel knows if a virtual machine was just cloned and we don't, so we risk generating the same random bytes twice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But NIST will not allow that. You need to follow a bunch of standards for how the randomness is generated, and the kernel doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what we do is we do everything that NIST asks and then every time you ask for randomness, we squirrel off, go to the kernel, get a little piece of extra entropy, stir it into the pot before giving back the result, and give back the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's still NIST compliant because it's as strong as both the NIST and the kernel solution, but it took some significant effort to show it is compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did the same for ECDSA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ECDSA is a digital signature mechanism. We've talked about it a few other times. It's just a way to take a message and a private key and generate a signature, here (s, r).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make a signature, you also need a random number, and that number must be used only once with the same private key. You cannot reuse it. That number is k here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why can you not reuse it? Because if you reuse it, then you can do this fun algebra thing and then pop the private key falls out by just smashing two signatures together. Bad, really, really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we generate this number that must never be the same?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, one option is we make it random.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if your random number generator breaks and generates twice the same random number? That would leak the private key, and that would be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the community came up with deterministic ECDSA. Instead of generating the nonce at random, we are going to hash the message and the private key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is still actually a little risky though, because if there's a fault in the CPU, for example, or a bug, because for example you're taking the wrong inputs, you might still end up generating the same value but signing a slightly different message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we mitigate both of those? We do both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We take some randomness and the private key and the message, we hash them all together, and now it's really, really hard for the number to come out the same. That's called hedged ECDSA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Go crypto library has been doing hedged ECDSA from way before it was called hedged and way before I was on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except… random ECDSA has always been FIPS. Deterministic ECDSA has been FIPS since a couple years ago. Hedged ECDSA is technically not FIPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really didn't want to make our ECDSA package less secure, so we found a forgotten draft that specifies a hedged ECDSA scheme, and we proceeded to argue that actually if you read SP 800-90A Revision 1 very carefully you realize that if you claim that the private key is just the DRBG entropy plus two-thirds of the DRBG nonce, you are allowed to use it because of SP 800-57 Part 1, etc etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We basically just figured out a way to claim it was fine and the lab eventually said "okay, shut up." I'm very proud of that one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about this, check out the announcement blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know you need commercial services for FIPS 140, here’s Geomys FIPS 140 commercial services page. If you don't know if you need them, you actually probably don't. It's fine, the standard library will probably solve this for you now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but who cares about this FIPS 140 stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Dude, we've been talking about FIPS 140 for 10 minutes and I don't care about that."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I care because I spent my last year on it and that apparently made me the top committer for the cycle to the Go repo and that's mostly FIPS 140 stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know how to feel about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been actually a lot of positive side effects from the FIPS 140 effort. We took care to make sure that everything that we found we would leave in a better state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, there are new packages that moved from x/crypto into the standard library: crypto/hkdf, crypto/pbkdf, crypto/sha3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SHA-3 is faster and doesn't allocate anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HKDF has a new generic API which lets you pass in a function that returns either a concrete type that implements Hash or a function that returns a Hash interface, which otherwise was a little annoying. (You had to make a little closure.) I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We restructured crypto/aes and crypto/cipher and in the process merged a contribution from a community member that made AES-CTR, the counter mode, between 2 and 9 times faster. That was a pretty good result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The assembly interfaces are much more consistent now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we finished cleaning up crypto/rsa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you remember from last year, we made the crypto/rsa sign and verify operations not use math/big and use constant time code. Now we also made key generation, validation, and pre-computation all not use math/big.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That loading keys that were serialized to JSON a lot faster, and made key generation much faster. But how much faster?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benchmarking key generation is really hard because it's a random process: you take a number random number and you check, is it prime? No. Toss. Is it prime? Nope. Toss. Is it prime?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You keep doing this. If you're lucky, it’s very fast. If you are unlucky, very slow. It’s a geometric distribution and if you want to average it out, you have to run for hours. Instead, I figured out a new way by mathematically deriving the average number of pulls you are supposed to do and preparing a synthetic run that gives exactly the expected mean number of checks, so that we get a representative sample to benchmark deterministically. That was a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, we detect more broken keys, and we did a rare backwards compatibility break to stop supporting keys smaller than 1024 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1024 is already pretty small, you should be using 2048 minimum, but if you're using less than 1024, it can be broken on the proverbial laptop. It's kind of silly that a production library lets you do something so insecure, and you can't tell them apart just by looking at the code. You have to know what the size of the key is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we just took that out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expected people to yell at me. Nobody yelled at me. Good job community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from adding stuff, you know that we are very into testing and that testing is how we keep that security track record that we talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have one bug in particular that is my white whale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(You might say, "Filippo, well-adjusted people don't have white whales." Well, we learned nothing new, have we?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My white whale is this assembly bug that we found at Cloudflare before I joined the Go team. I spent an afternoon figuring out an exploit for it with Sean Devlin in Paris, while the yellow jackets set fire to cop cars outside. That's a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an assembly bug where the carry—literally the carry like when you do a pen and paper multiplication—was just not accounted for correctly. You can watch my talk Squeezing a Key through a Carry Bit if you are curious to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem with this stuff is that it's so hard to get code coverage for it because all the code always runs. It's just that you don't know if it always runs with that carry at zero, and if the carry was one, it’d do the wrong math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we've cracked it, by using mutation testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a framework that tells the assembler, "hey, anywhere you see an add-with-carry, replace it with a simple add that discards the carry." Then we run the tests. If the tests still pass, the test did not cover that carry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that happens we fail a meta-test and tell whoever's sending the CL, “hey, no, no, no, you gotta test that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same for checking the case in which the carry is always set. We replace the add-with-carry with a simple add and then insert a +1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a little tricky. If you want to read more about it, it's in this blog post. I'm very hopeful that will help us with all this assembly stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, accumulated test vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a little trick that I'm very very fond of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say you want to test a very large space. For example there are two inputs and they can both be 0 to 200 bytes long, and you want to test all the size combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That would be a lot of test vectors, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I checked in a megabyte of test vectors every time I wanted to do that, people eventually would yell at me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead what we do is run the algorithm with each size combination, and take the result and we put it inside a rolling hash. Then at the end we take the hash result and we check that it comes out right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do this with two implementations. If it comes out to the same hash, great. If it comes out not to the same hash, it doesn't help you figure out what the bug is, but it tells you there's a bug. I'll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really like reusing other people's tests. We're lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BoringSSL people have a fantastic suite of tests for TLS called BoGo and Daniel has been doing fantastic work integrating that and making crypto/tls stricter and stricter in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's now much more spec compliant on the little things where it goes like, “no, no, no, you're not allowed to put a zero here” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, the Let's Encrypt people have a test tool for the ACME protocol called Pebble. (Because it's a small version of their production system called Boulder! It took me a long time to figure it out and eventually I was like ooooohhh.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, NIST has this X.509 interoperability test suite, which just doesn't have a good name. It's good though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More assembly cleanups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There used to be places in assembly where—as if assembly was not complicated enough—instructions were just written down as raw machine code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes even the comment was wrong! Can you tell the comment changed in that patch? This is a thing Roland and Joel found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there's a test that will just yell at you if you try to commit a &lt;code&gt;WORD&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;BYTE&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also removed all the assembly that was specifically there for speeding up stuff on CPUs that don't have AVX2. AVX2 came out in 2015 and if you want to go fast, you're probably not using the CPU generation from back then. We still run on it, just not as fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More landings! I’m going to speed through these ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all stuff that we talked about last year and that we actually landed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stuff like data independent timing to tell the CPU, "no, no, I actually did mean for you to do that in constant time, goddammit."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And server-side TLS Encrypted Client Hello, which is a privacy improvement. We had client side, now we have server side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;crypto/rand.Read never fails. We promised that, we did that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, do you know how hard it is to test the failure case of something that never fails? I had to re-implement the seccomp library to tell the kernel to break the getrandom syscall to check what happens when it doesn’t work. There are tests all pointing guns at each other to make sure the fallback both works and is never hit unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also much faster now because Jason Donenfeld added the Linux getrandom VDSO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sean Liao added rand.Text like we promised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then more stuff like hash.Cloner, which I think makes a lot of things a little easier, and more and more and more and more. The Go 1.24 and Go 1.25 release notes are there for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;x/crypto/ssh is also under our maintenance and some excellent stuff happened there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better tests, better error messages, better compatibility, and we're working on some v2 APIs. If you have opinions, it’s time to come to those issues to talk about them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been an exciting year, and I'm going to give you just two samples of things we're planning to do for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is TLS profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately no one wants to specifically configure the fifteen different knobs of a TLS library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately no one—because I know there are some people who do and they yell at me regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But instead most people just want "hey, make it broadly compatible." "Hey, make it FIPS compliant." "Hey, make it modern."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're looking for a way to make it easy to just say what your goal is, and then we do all the configuration for you in a way that makes sense and that evolves with time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm excited about this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And maybe something with passkeys? If you run websites that authenticate users a bunch with password hashes and maybe also with WebAuthN, find me, email us, we want feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to figure out what to build here, into the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, so it's been a year of cryptography, but it's also been a year of Geomys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geomys launched a year ago here at GopherCon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want an update, we went on the Fallthrough podcast to talk about it, so check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are now a real company and how you know is that we have totes: it's the equivalent of a Facebook-official relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best FIPS 140 side effect has been that we have a new maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daniel McCarney joined us to help with the FIPS effort and then we were working very well together so Geomys decided to just take him on as a permanent maintainer on the Go crypto maintenance team. I’m very excited about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all possible thanks to our clients, and if you have any questions, here are the links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might also want to follow me on Bluesky at @filippo.abyssdomain.expert or on Mastodon at @filippo@abyssdomain.expert.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My work is made possible by Geomys, an organization of professional Go maintainers, which is funded by Smallstep, Ava Labs, Teleport, Tailscale, and Sentry. Through our retainer contracts they ensure the sustainability and reliability of our open source maintenance work and get a direct line to my expertise and that of the other Geomys maintainers. (Learn more in the Geomys announcement.) Here are a few words from some of them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Teleport — For the past five years, attacks and compromises have been shifting from traditional malware and security breaches to identifying and compromising valid user accounts and credentials with social engineering, credential theft, or phishing. Teleport Identity is designed to eliminate weak access patterns through access monitoring, minimize attack surface with access requests, and purge unused permissions via mandatory access reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ava Labs — We at Ava Labs, maintainer of AvalancheGo (the most widely used client for interacting with the Avalanche Network), believe the sustainable maintenance and development of open source cryptographic protocols is critical to the broad adoption of blockchain technology. We are proud to support this necessary and impactful work through our ongoing sponsorship of Filippo and his team.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello world, this is Abhay from Poly (&lt;/p&gt;https://poly.app&lt;p&gt;). We’re building an app to replace Finder/File Explorer with something more intelligent and searchable. Think of it like Dropbox + NotebookLM + Perplexity for terabytes of your files. Here’s a quick demo: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsqCySU4Ln0&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poly can search your content in natural language, across a broad range of file types and down to the page, paragraph, pixel, or point in time. We also provide an integrated agent that can take actions on your files such as creating, editing, summarizing, and researching. Any action that you can take, the agent can also take, from renaming, moving, tagging, annotating, and organizing files for you. The agent can also read URLs, youtube links, and can search the web and even download files for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some public drives that you can poke around in (note: it doesn’t work in Safari yet—sorry! we’re working on it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every issue of the Whole Earth Catalogue: https://poly.app/shared/whole-earth-catalogues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archive of old Playstation Manuals: https://poly.app/shared/playstation-manuals-archive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini archive of Orson Welles interviews and commercial spots: https://poly.app/shared/orson-welles-archive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archive of Salvador Dali’s paintings for Alice in Wonderland: https://poly.app/shared/salvador-dali-alice-in-wonderland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To try it out, navigate to one of these public folders and use the agent or search to find things. The demo video above can give you an idea of how the UI roughly works. Select files by clicking on them. Quick view by pressing space. Open the details for any file by pressing cmd + i. You can search from the top middle bar (or press cmd + K), and all searches will use semantic similarity and search within the files. Or use the agent from the bottom right tools menu (or press cmd + ?) and you can ask about the files, have the agent search for you, summarize things, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to build this after launching an early image-gen company back in March 2022, and realizing how painful it was for users to store, manage, and search their libraries, especially in a world of generative media. Despite our service having over 150,000 users at that point, we realized that our true calling was fixing the file browser to make it intelligent, so we shut our service down in 2023 and pivoted to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think Poly will be a great fit for anyone that wants to do useful things with their files, such as summarizing research papers, finding the right media or asset, creating a shareable portfolio, searching for a particular form or document, and producing reports and overviews. Of course, it’s a great way to organize your genAI assets as well. Or just use it to organize notes, links, inspo, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, Poly is built on our advanced search model, Polyembed-v1 that natively supports multimodal search across text, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, audio, video, PDFs, and more. We allow you to search by phrase, file similarity, color, face, and several other kinds of features. The agent is particularly skilled at using the search, so you can type in something like “find me the last lease agreement I signed” and it can go look for it by searching, reading the first few files, searching again if nothing matches, etc. But the quality of our embed model means it almost always finds the file in the first search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works identically across web and desktop, except on desktop it syncs your cloud files to a folder (just like google drive). On the web we use clever caching to enable offline support and file conflict recovery. We’ve taken great pains to make our system faster than your existing file browser, even if you’re using it from a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;File storage plans are currently at: 100GB free tier, paid tier is 2TB at $10/m, and 1c per GB per month on top of the 2TB. We also have rate limits for agent use that vary at different tiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to expand with many features over the following months, including “virtual files” (store your google docs in Poly), sync from other hosting providers, mobile apps, an MCP ecosystem for the agent, access to web search and deep research modes, offline search, local file support (on desktop), third-party sources (WebDAV, NAS), and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our waitlist is now open and we’ll be letting folks in starting today! Sign up at https://poly.app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d also love to hear your thoughts (and concerns) about what we’re building, as we’re early in this journey so your feedback can very much shape the future of our company!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preserving code that shaped generations: Zork I, II, and III go Open Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WRITTEN BY&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;/en-us/opensource/blog/author/stacey-haffner&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;/en-us/opensource/blog/author/scott-hanselman&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A game that changed how we think about play&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Zork arrived, it didn’t just ask players to win; it asked them to imagine. There were no graphics, no joystick, and no soundtrack, only words on a screen and the player’s curiosity. Yet those words built worlds more vivid than most games of their time. What made that possible wasn’t just clever writing, it was clever engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beneath that world of words was something quietly revolutionary: the Z-Machine, a custom-built engine. Z-Machine is a specification of a virtual machine, and now there are many Z-Machine interpreters that we used today that are software implementations of that VM. The original mainframe version of Zork was too large for early home computers to handle, so the team at Infocom made a practical choice. They split it into three games titled Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III, all powered by the same underlying system. This also meant that instead of rebuilding the game for each platform, they could use the Z-Machine to interpret the same story files on any computer. That design made Zork one of the first games to be truly cross-platform, appearing on Apple IIs, IBM PCs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Preserving a piece of history&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Game preservation takes many forms, and it’s important to consider research as well as play. The Zork source code deserves to be preserved and studied. Rather than creating new repositories, we’re contributing directly to history. In collaboration with Jason Scott, the well-known digital archivist of Internet Archive fame, we have officially submitted upstream pull requests to the historical source repositories of Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III. Those pull requests add a clear MIT LICENSE and formally document the open-source grant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each repository includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Source code for Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accompanying documentation where available, such as build notes, comments, and historically relevant files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear licensing and attribution, via MIT LICENSE.txt and repository-level metadata.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This release focuses purely on the code itself. It does not include commercial packaging or marketing materials, and it does not grant rights to any trademarks or brands, which remain with their respective owners. All assets outside the scope of these titles’ source code are intentionally excluded to preserve historical accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Running Zork I-III today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than forty years later, Zork is still alive and easier than ever to play. The games remain commercially available via The Zork Anthology on Good Old Games. For those who enjoy a more hands on approach, the games can be compiled and run locally using ZILF, the modern Z-Machine interpreter created by Tara McGrew. ZILF compiles ZIL files into Z3s that can be run with Tara’s own ZLR which is a sentence I never thought I’d write, much less say out loud! There are a huge number of wonderful Z-machine runners across all platforms for you to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how to get started running Zork locally with ZILF. From the command line, compile and assembly the zork1.zil into a runnable z3 file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;"%ZILF_PATH%\zilf.exe" zork1.zil &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;"%ZILF_PATH%\zapf.exe" zork1.zap zork1-ignite.z3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then run your Z3 file in a Zmachine runner. I’m using Windows Frotz from David Kinder based on Stefan Jokisch’s Frotz core:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Continuing the journey&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will use the existing historical repositories as the canonical home for Zork’s source. Once the initial pull requests land under the MIT License, contributions are welcome. We chose MIT for its simplicity and openness because it makes the code easy to study, teach, and build upon. File issues, share insights, or submit small, well-documented improvements that help others learn from the original design. The goal is not to modernize Zork but to preserve it as a space for exploration and education.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zork has always been more than a game. It is a reminder that imagination and engineering can outlast generations of hardware and players. Bringing this code into the open is both a celebration and a thank you to the original Infocom creators for inventing a universe we are still exploring, to Jason Scott and the Internet Archive for decades of stewardship and partnership, and to colleagues across Microsoft OSPO, Xbox, and Activision who helped make open source possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Lions Operating System #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;LionsOS is currently undergoing active research and development, it does not have a concrete verification story yet. It is not expected for LionsOS to be stable at this time, but it is available for others to experiment with.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LionsOS is an operating system based on the seL4 microkernel with the goal of making the achievements of seL4 accessible. That is, to provide performance, security, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LionsOS is being developed by the Trustworthy Systems research group at UNSW Sydney in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not a conventional operating system, but contains composable components for creating custom operating systems that are specific to a particular task. Components are joined together using the Microkit tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The principles on which a LionsOS system is built are laid out fully in the sDDF design document; but in brief they are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Components are connected by lock-free queues using an efficient model-checked signalling mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As far as is practical, operating systems components do a single thing. Drivers for instance exist solely to convert between a hardware interface and a set of queues to talk to the rest of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Components called virtualisers handle multiplexing and control, and conversion between virtual and IO addresses for drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Information is shared only where necessary, via the queues, or via published information pages.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The system is static: it does not adapt to changing hardware, and does not load components at runtime. There is a mechanism for swapping components of the same type at runtime, to implement policy changes, or to reboot a virtual machine with a new Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be successful, many more components are needed. Pull requests to the various repositories are welcome. See the page on contributing for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March 2024, Mozilla said it was winding down its collaboration with Onerep — an identity protection service offered with the Firefox web browser that promises to remove users from hundreds of people-search sites — after KrebsOnSecurity revealed Onerep’s founder had created dozens of people-search services and was continuing to operate at least one of them. Sixteen months later, however, Mozilla is still promoting Onerep. This week, Mozilla announced its partnership with Onerep will officially end next month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement published Tuesday, Mozilla said it will soon discontinue Monitor Plus, which offered data broker site scans and automated personal data removal from Onerep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We will continue to offer our free Monitor data breach service, which is integrated into Firefox’s credential manager, and we are focused on integrating more of our privacy and security experiences in Firefox, including our VPN, for free,” the advisory reads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla said current Monitor Plus subscribers will retain full access through the wind-down period, which ends on Dec. 17, 2025. After that, those subscribers will automatically receive a prorated refund for the unused portion of their subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We explored several options to keep Monitor Plus going, but our high standards for vendors, and the realities of the data broker ecosystem made it challenging to consistently deliver the level of value and reliability we expect for our users,” Mozilla statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On March 14, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published an investigation showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder Dimitiri Shelest launched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called Nuwber that sells background reports on people. Shelest released a lengthy statement wherein he acknowledged maintaining an ownership stake in Nuwber, a data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he launched Onerep.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Data-at-Rest Encryption in DuckDB&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: DuckDB v1.4 ships database encryption capabilities. In this blog post, we dive into the implementation details of the encryption, show how to use it and demonstrate its performance implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you would like to use encryption in DuckDB, we recommend using the latest stable version, v1.4.2. For more details, see the latest release blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many years ago, we read the excellent “Code Book” by Simon Singh. Did you know that Mary, Queen of Scots, used an encryption method harking back to Julius Caesar to encrypt her more saucy letters? But alas: the cipher was broken and the contents of the letters got her executed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days, strong encryption software and hardware is a commodity. Modern CPUs come with specialized cryptography instructions, and operating systems small and big contain mostly-robust cryptography software like OpenSSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Databases store arbitrary information, it is clear that many if not most datasets of any value should perhaps not be plainly available to everyone. Even if stored on tightly controlled hardware like a cloud virtual machine, there have been many cases of files being lost through various privilege escalations. Unsurprisingly, compliance frameworks like the common SOC 2 “highly recommend” encrypting data when stored on storage mediums like hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, database systems and encryption have a somewhat problematic track record. Even PostgreSQL, the self-proclaimed “The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database” has very limited options for data encryption. SQLite, the world’s “Most Widely Deployed and Used Database Engine” does not support data encryption out-of-the-box, its encryption extension is a $2000 add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DuckDB has supported Parquet Modular Encryption for a while. This feature allows reading and writing Parquet files with encrypted columns. However, while Parquet files are great and reports of their impending death are greatly exaggerated, they cannot – for example – be updated in place, a pretty basic feature of a database management system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with DuckDB 1.4.0, DuckDB supports transparent data encryption of data-at-rest using industry-standard AES encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;DuckDB's encryption does not yet meet the official NIST requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some Basics of Encryption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many different ways to encrypt data, some more secure than others. In database systems and elsewhere, the standard is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is a block cipher algorithm standardized by US NIST. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason, most systems choose to only support randomized encryption, meaning that identical plaintexts will always yield different ciphertexts (if used correctly!). The most commonly used industry standard and recommended encryption algorithm is AES – Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM). This is because on top of its ability to randomize encryption, it also authenticates data by calculating a tag to ensure data has not been tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DuckDB v1.4 supports encryption at rest using AES-GCM-256 and AES-CTR-256 (counter mode) ciphers. AES-CTR is a simpler and faster version of AES-GCM, but less secure, since it does not provide authentication by calculating a tag. The 256 refers to the size of the key in bits, meaning that DuckDB now only supports GCM with 32-byte keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GCM and CTR both require as input a (1) plaintext, (2) an initialization vector (IV) and (3) an encryption key. Plaintext is the text that a user wants to encrypt. An IV is a unique bytestream of usually 16 bytes, that ensures that identical plaintexts get encrypted into different ciphertexts. A number used once (nonce) is a bytestream of usually 12 bytes, that together with a 4-byte counter construct the IV. Note that the IV needs to be unique for every encrypted block, but it does not necessarily have to be random. Reuse of the same IV is problematic, since an attacker could XOR the two ciphertexts and extract both messages. The tag in AES-GCM is calculated after all blocks are encrypted, pretty much like a checksum, but it adds an integrity check that securely authenticates the entire ciphertext.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation in DuckDB&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before diving deeper into how we actually implemented encryption in DuckDB, we’ll explain some things about the DuckDB file format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DuckDB has one main database header which stores data that enables it to correctly load and verify a DuckDB database. At the start of each DuckDB main database header, the magic bytes (“DUCKDB”) are stored and read upon initialization to verify whether the file is a valid DuckDB database file. The magic bytes are followed by four 8-byte of flags that can be set for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a database is encrypted in DuckDB, the main database header remains plaintext at all times, since the main header contains no sensitive data about the contents of the database file. Upon initializing an encrypted database, DuckDB sets the first bit in the first flag to indicate that the database is encrypted. After setting this bit, additional metadata is stored that is necessary for encryption. This metadata entails the (1) database identifier, (2) 8 bytes of additional metadata for e.g. the encryption cipher used, and (3) the encrypted canary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The database identifier is used as a “salt”, and consists of 16 randomly generated bytes created upon initialization of each database. The salt is often used to ensure uniqueness, i.e., it makes sure that identical input keys or passwords are transformed into different derived keys. The 8-bytes of metadata comprise the key derivation function (first byte), usage of additional authenticated data (second byte), the encryption cipher (third byte), and the key length (fifth byte). After the metadata, the main header uses the encrypted canary to check if the input key is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Encryption Key Management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To encrypt data in DuckDB, you can use practically any plaintext or base64 encoded string, but we recommend using a secure 32-byte base64 key. The user itself is responsible for the key management and thus for using a secure key. Instead of directly using the plain key provided by the user, DuckDB always derives a more secure key by means of a key derivation function (kdf). The kdf is a function that reduces or extends the input key to a 32-byte secure key. If the correctness of the input key is checked by deriving the secure key and decrypting the canary, the derived key is managed in a secure encryption key cache. This cache manages encryption keys for the current DuckDB context and ensures that the derived encryption keys are never swapped to disk by locking its memory. To strengthen security even more, the original input keys are immediately wiped from memory when the input keys are transformed into secure derived keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;DuckDB Block Structure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the main database header, DuckDB stores two 4KB database headers that contain more information about e.g. the block (header) size and the storage version used. After keeping the main database header plaintext, all remaining headers and blocks are encrypted when encryption is used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blocks in DuckDB are by default 256KB, but their size is configurable. At the start of each plaintext block there is an 8-byte block header, which stores an 8-byte checksum. The checksum is a simple calculation that is often used in database systems to check for any corrupted data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For encrypted blocks however, its block header consists of 40 bytes instead of 8 bytes for the checksum. The block header for encrypted blocks contains a 16-byte nonce/IV and, optionally, a 16-byte tag, depending on which encryption cipher is used. The nonce and tag are stored in plaintext, but the checksum is encrypted for better security. Note that the block header always needs to be 8-bytes aligned to calculate the checksum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Write-Ahead-Log Encryption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The write ahead log (WAL) in database systems is a crash recovery mechanism to ensure durability. It is an append-only file that is used in scenarios where the database crashed or is abruptly closed, and when not all changes are written yet to the main database file. The WAL makes sure these changes can be replayed up to the last checkpoint; which is a consistent snapshot of the database at a certain point in time. This means, when a checkpoint is enforced, which happens in DuckDB by either (1) closing the database or (2) reaching a certain threshold for storage, the WAL gets written into the main database file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In DuckDB, you can force the creation of a WAL by setting&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;PRAGMA disable_checkpoint_on_shutdown;
PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint = '1TB';
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This way you’ll disable a checkpointing on closing the database, meaning that the WAL does not get merged into the main database file. In addition, by setting wal_autocheckpoint to a high threshold, this will avoid intermediate checkpoints to happen and the WAL will persist. For example, we can create a persistent WAL file by first setting the above PRAGMAs, then attach an encrypted database, and then create a table where we insert 3 values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ATTACH 'encrypted.db' AS enc (
    ENCRYPTION_KEY 'asdf',
    ENCRYPTION_CIPHER 'GCM'
);
CREATE TABLE enc.test (a INTEGER, b INTEGER);
INSERT INTO enc.test VALUES (11, 22), (13, 22), (12, 21)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we now close the DuckDB process, we can see that there is a &lt;code&gt;.wal&lt;/code&gt; file shown: &lt;code&gt;encrypted.db.wal&lt;/code&gt;. But how is the WAL created internally?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before writing new entries (inserts, updates, deletes) to the database, these entries are essentially logged and appended to the WAL. Only after logged entries are flushed to disk, a transaction is considered as committed. A plaintext WAL entry has the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the WAL is append-only, we encrypt a WAL entry per value. For AES-GCM this means that we append a nonce and a tag to each entry. The structure in which we do this is depicted in below. When we serialize an encrypted entry to the encrypted WAL, we first store the length in plaintext, because we need to know how many bytes we should decrypt. The length is followed by a nonce, which on its turn is followed by the encrypted checksum and the encrypted entry itself. After the entry, a 16-byte tag is stored for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encrypting the WAL is triggered by default when an encryption key is given for any (un)encrypted database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Temporary File Encryption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Temporary files are used to store intermediate data that is often necessary for large, out-of-core operations such as sorting, large joins and window functions. This data could contain sensitive information and can, in case of a crash, remain on disk. To protect this leftover data, DuckDB automatically encrypts temporary files too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Structure of Temporary Files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three different types of temporary files in DuckDB: (1) temporary files that have the same layout as a regular 256KB block, (2) compressed temporary files and (3) temporary files that exceed the standard 256KB block size. The former two are suffixed with .tmp, while the latter is distinguished by a suffix with .block. To keep track of the size of .block temporary files, they are always prefixed with its length. As opposed to regular database blocks, temporary files do not contain a checksum to check for data corruption, since the calculation of a checksum is somewhat expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Encrypting Temporary Files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Temporary files are encrypted (1) automatically when you attach an encrypted database or (2) when you use the setting &lt;code&gt;SET temp_file_encryption = true&lt;/code&gt;. In the latter case, the main database file is plaintext, but the temporary files will be encrypted. For the encryption of temporary files DuckDB internally generates temporary keys. This means that when the database crashes, the temporary keys are also lost. Temporary files cannot be decrypted in this case and are then essentially garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To force DuckDB to produce temporary files, you can use a simple trick by just setting the memory limit low. This will create temporary files once the memory limit is exceeded. For example, we can create a new encrypted database, load this database with TPC-H data (SF 1), and then set the memory limit to 1 GB. If we then perform a large join, we force DuckDB to spill intermediate data to disk. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SET memory_limit = '1GB';
ATTACH 'tpch_encrypted.db' AS enc (
    ENCRYPTION_KEY 'asdf',
    ENCRYPTION_CIPHER 'cipher'
);
USE enc;
CALL dbgen(sf = 1);

ALTER TABLE lineitem
    RENAME TO lineitem1;
CREATE TABLE lineitem2 AS
    FROM lineitem1;
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ans AS
    SELECT l1.* , l2.*
    FROM lineitem1 l1
    JOIN lineitem2 l2 USING (l_orderkey , l_linenumber);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sequence of commands will result in encrypted temporary files being written to disk. Once the query completes or when the DuckDB shell is exited, the temporary files are automatically cleaned up. In case of a crash however, it may happen that temporary files will be left on disk and need to be cleaned up manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to Use Encryption in DuckDB&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In DuckDB, you can (1) encrypt an existing database, (2) initialize a new, empty encrypted database or (3) reencrypt a database. For example, let's create a new database, load this database with TPC-H data of scale factor 1 and then encrypt this database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;INSTALL tpch;
LOAD tpch;
ATTACH 'encrypted.duckdb' AS encrypted (ENCRYPTION_KEY 'asdf');
ATTACH 'unencrypted.duckdb' AS unencrypted;
USE unencrypted;
CALL dbgen(sf = 1);
COPY FROM DATABASE unencrypted TO encrypted;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is not a trivial way to prove that a database is encrypted, but correctly encrypted data should look like random noise and has a high entropy. So, to check whether a database is actually encrypted, we can use tools to calculate the entropy or visualize the binary, such as ent and binocle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we use ent after executing the above chunk of SQL, i.e., &lt;code&gt;ent encrypted.duckdb&lt;/code&gt;, this will result in an entropy of 7.99999 bits per byte. If we do the same for the plaintext (unencrypted) database, this results in 7.65876 bits per byte. Note that the plaintext database also has a high entropy, but this is due to compression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s now visualize both the plaintext and encrypted data with binocle. For the visualization we created both a plaintext DuckDB database with scale factor of 0.001 of TPC-H data and an encrypted one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Click here to see the entropy of a plaintext database&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Click here to see the entropy of an encrypted database&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these figures, we can clearly observe that the encrypted database file seems completely random, while the plaintext database file shows some clear structure in its binary data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To decrypt an encrypted database, we can use the following SQL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ATTACH 'encrypted.duckdb' AS encrypted (ENCRYPTION_KEY 'asdf');
ATTACH 'new_unencrypted.duckdb' AS unencrypted;
COPY FROM DATABASE encrypted TO unencrypted;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And to reencrypt an existing database, we can just simply copy the old encrypted database to a new one, like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ATTACH 'encrypted.duckdb' AS encrypted (ENCRYPTION_KEY 'asdf');
ATTACH 'new_encrypted.duckdb' AS new_encrypted (ENCRYPTION_KEY 'xxxx');
COPY FROM DATABASE encrypted TO new_encrypted;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default encryption algorithm is AES GCM. This is recommended since it also authenticates data by calculating a tag. Depending on the use case, you can also use AES CTR. This is faster than AES GCM since it skips calculating a tag after encrypting all data. You can specify the CTR cipher as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ATTACH 'encrypted.duckdb' AS encrypted (
    ENCRYPTION_KEY 'asdf',
    ENCRYPTION_CIPHER 'CTR'
);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep track of which databases are encrypted, you can query this by running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;FROM duckdb_databases();
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will show which databases are encrypted, and which cipher is used:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;database_name&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;database_oid&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;path&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;…&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;encrypted&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;cipher&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;encrypted&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2103&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;encrypted.duckdb&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;…&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;true&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;GCM&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;unencrypted&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2050&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;unencrypted.duckdb&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;…&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;false&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NULL&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;memory&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;592&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NULL&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;…&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;false&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NULL&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;system&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NULL&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;…&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;false&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NULL&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;temp&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1995&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NULL&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;…&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;false&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NULL&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5 rows — 10 columns (5 shown)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation and Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here at DuckDB, we strive to achieve a good out-of-the-box experience with zero external dependencies and a small footprint. Encryption and decryption, however, are usually performed by pretty heavy external libraries such as OpenSSL. We would much prefer not to rely on external libraries or statically linking huge codebases just so that people can use encryption in DuckDB without additional steps. This is why we actually implemented encryption twice in DuckDB, once with the (excellent) Mbed TLS library and once with the ubiquitous OpenSSL library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DuckDB already shipped parts of Mbed TLS because we use it to verify RSA extension signatures. However, for maximum compatibility we actually disabled the hardware acceleration of MbedTLS, which has a performance impact. Furthermore, Mbed TLS is not particularly hardened against things like nasty timing attacks. OpenSSL on the other hand contains heavily vetted and hardware-accelerated code to perform AES operations, which is why we can also use it for encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In DuckDB Land, OpenSSL is part of the &lt;code&gt;httpfs&lt;/code&gt; extension. Once you load that extension, encryption will automatically switch to using OpenSSL. After we shipped encryption in DuckDB 1.4.0, security experts actually found issues with the random number generator we used in Mbed TLS mode. Even though it would be difficult to actually exploit this, we disabled writing to databases in MbedTLS mode from DuckDB 1.4.1. Instead, DuckDB now (version 1.4.2+) tries to auto-install and auto-load the &lt;code&gt;httpfs&lt;/code&gt; extension whenever a write is attempted. We might be able to revisit this in the future, but for now this seems the safest path forward that still allows high compatibility for reading. In OpenSSL mode, we always used a cryptographically-safe random number generation so that mode is unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encrypting and decrypting database files is an additional step in writing tables to disk, so we would naturally assume that there is some performance impact. Let’s investigate the performance impact of DuckDB’s new encryption feature with a very basic experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first create two DuckDB database files, one encrypted and one unencrypted. We use the TPC-H benchmark generator again to create the table data, particularly the (somewhat tired) &lt;code&gt;lineitem&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;INSTALL httpfs;
INSTALL tpch;
LOAD tpch;

ATTACH 'unencrypted.duckdb' AS unencrypted;
CALL dbgen(sf = 10, catalog = 'unencrypted');

ATTACH 'encrypted.duckdb' AS encrypted (ENCRYPTION_KEY 'asdf');
CREATE TABLE encrypted.lineitem AS FROM unencrypted.lineitem;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we use DuckDB’s neat &lt;code&gt;SUMMARIZE&lt;/code&gt; command three times: once on the unencrypted database, and once on the encrypted database using MbedTLS and once on the encrypted database using OpenSSL. We set a very low memory limit to force more reading and writing from disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SET memory_limit = '200MB';
.timer on

SUMMARIZE unencrypted.lineitem;
SUMMARIZE encrypted.lineitem;

LOAD httpfs; -- use OpenSSL
SUMMARIZE encrypted.lineitem;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the results on a fairly recent MacBook: &lt;code&gt;SUMMARIZE&lt;/code&gt; on the unencrypted table took ca. 5.4 seconds. Using Mbed TLS, this went up to around 6.2 s. However, when enabling OpenSSL the end-to-end time went straight back to 5.4 s. How is this possible? Is decryption not expensive? Well, there is a lot more happening in query processing than reading blocks from storage. So the impact of decryption is not all that huge, even when using a slow implementation. Secondly, when using hardware acceleration in OpenSSL, the overall overhead of encryption and decryption becomes almost negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But just running summarization is overly simplistic. Real™ database workloads include modifications to data, insertion of new rows, updates of rows, deletion of rows etc. Also, multiple clients will be updating and querying at the same time. So we re-surrected the full TPC-H “Power” test from our previous blog post “Changing Data with Confidence and ACID”. We slightly tweaked the benchmark script to enable the new database encryption. For this experiment, we used the OpenSSL encryption implementation due to the issues outlined above. We observe Power@Size” and “Throughput@Size”. The former is raw sequential query performance, while the latter measures multiple parallel query streams in the presence of updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When running on the same MacBook with DuckDB 1.4.1 and a “scale factor” of 100, we get a Power@Size metric of 624,296 and a Throughput@Size metric of 450,409 without encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we enable encryption, the results are almost unchanged, confirming the observation of the small microbenchmark above. However, the relationship between available memory and the benchmark size means that we’re not stressing temporary file encryption. So we re-ran everything with an 8GB memory limit. We confirmed constant reading and writing to and from disk in this configuration by observing operating system statistics. For the unencrypted case, the Power@Size metric predictably went down to 591,841 and Throughput@Size went down to 153,690. And finally, we could observe a slight performance decrease with Power@Size of 571,985 and Throughput@Size of 145,353. However, that difference is not very great either and likely not relevant in real operational scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the new encrypted database feature, we can now safely pass around DuckDB database files with all information inside them completely opaque to prying eyes. This allows for some interesting new deployment models for DuckDB, for example, we could now put an encrypted DuckDB database file on a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A fleet of DuckDB instances could attach to this file read-only using the decryption key. This elegantly allows efficient distribution of private background data in a similar way like encrypted Parquet files, but of course with many more features like multi-table storage. When using DuckDB with encrypted storage, we can also simplify threat modeling when – for example – using DuckDB on cloud providers. While in the past access to DuckDB storage would have been enough to leak data, we can now relax paranoia regarding storage a little, especially since temporary files and WAL are also encrypted. And the best part of all of this, there is almost no performance overhead to using encryption in DuckDB, especially with the OpenSSL implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are very much looking forward to what you are going to do with this feature, and please let us know if you run into any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Border Patrol is monitoring US drivers and detaining those with ‘suspicious’ travel patterns&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious. (AP video: Marshall Ritzel)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over — often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement’s radar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once limited to policing the nation’s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country’s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans’ daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Border Patrol is using hidden license plate readers to track drivers and flag “suspicious” travel patterns, an AP investigation found, raising concerns over secret surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Border Patrol’s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are “governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“For national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,” the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol’s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that “large-scale surveillance technology that’s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time” might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America’s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know … engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,” Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP’s findings. “These surveillance systems do not make communities safer.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘We did everything right and had nothing to hide’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott’s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Schott’s case, Babb testified that federal agents “actually watch travel patterns on the highway” through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: “I just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After finding nothing in Schott’s car, Babb said “nine times out of 10, this is what happens,” a phrase Schott’s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff’s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Bexar County sheriff’s office declined to comment due to pending litigation and referred all questions about the Schott case to the county’s district attorney. The district attorney did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The case is pending in federal court in Texas. Schott said in an interview with the AP: “I didn’t know it was illegal to drive in Texas.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘Patterns of life’ and license plates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also from AP’s investigation into the use of surveillance technology:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U.S. tech firms to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling rights abuses than known before.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Across five Republican and Democratic administrations, the U.S. government has repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Transformation of CBP into intelligence agency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Border Patrol’s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol’s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Trump’s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration’s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We took Alek’s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,” said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. ”What we found was something much larger — a system of mass surveillance that threatens people’s freedom of movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don’t realize they’ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I assume for every one person like me, who’s actually standing up, there’s a thousand people who just don’t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don’t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,” Schott said. “I think there’s thousands of people getting treated this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
