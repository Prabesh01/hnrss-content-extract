  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Alibaba Cloud says it cut Nvidia AI GPU use by 82% with new pooling system— up to 9x increase in output lets 213 GPUs perform like 1,192&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A paper presented at SOSP 2025 details how token-level scheduling helped one GPU serve multiple LLMs, reducing demand from 1,192 to 213 H20s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alibaba Cloud claims its new Aegaeon pooling system reduces the number of Nvidia GPUs required to serve large language models by 82% during a multi-month beta test inside its Model Studio marketplace. The result, published in a peer-reviewed paper presented at the 2025 ACM Symposium on Operating Systems (SOSP) in Seoul, suggests that cloud providers may be able to extract significantly more inference capacity from existing silicon, especially in constrained markets like China, where the supply of Nvidia's latest H20s remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike training-time breakthroughs that chase model quality or speed, Aegaeon is an inference-time scheduler designed to maximize GPU utilization across many models with bursty or unpredictable demand. Instead of pinning one accelerator to one model, Aegaeon virtualizes GPU access at the token level, allowing it to schedule tiny slices of work across a shared pool. This means one H20 could serve several different models simultaneously, with system-wide “goodput” — a measure of effective output — rising by as much as nine times compared to older serverless systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system was tested in production over several months, according to the paper, which lists authors from both Peking University and Alibaba’s infrastructure division, including CTO Jingren Zhou. During that window, the number of GPUs needed to support dozens of different LLMs — ranging in size up to 72 billion parameters — fell from 1,192 to just 213.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the paper does not break down which models contributed most to the savings, reporting by the South China Morning Post says the tests were conducted using Nvidia’s H20, one of the few accelerators still legally available to Chinese buyers under current U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alibaba says the gains came from two main techniques: Packing multiple models per GPU, and using a token-level autoscaler to dynamically allocate compute as output is generated, rather than reserving resources at the request level. In benchmarks, Aegaeon beat the goodput of ServerlessLLM and MuxServe by margins ranging from 1.5 times to 9 times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether those savings translate outside Alibaba’s stack remains to be seen. Alibaba Cloud’s paper does not specify the exact network fabric used in the beta test, but we know the company offers its own eRDMA elastic RDMA network and has a record of building highly‑integrated GPU serving stacks, suggesting the results may depend on an optimized, vertically integrated environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless, the result is likely to attract interest from other hyperscalers looking to stretch scarce accelerator fleets as inference demand continues to spike.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A while back, Google DeepMind unveiled Gemini Diffusion, an experimental language model that generates text using diffusion. Unlike traditional GPT-style models that generate one word at a time, Gemini Diffusion creates whole blocks of text by refining random noise step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read the paper Large Language Diffusion Models and was surprised to find that discrete language diffusion is just a generalization of masked language modeling (MLM), something we’ve been doing since 2018. The first thought I had was, “can we finetune a BERT-like model to do text generation?” I decided to try a quick proof of concept out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;NOTE: After I wrote the article I stumbled upon the paper DiffusionBERT which does essentially the same thing but with more rigorous testing! Check it out if this post interested you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Short History of Transformers#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, was an encoder-decoder model. In 2018, researchers realized that the encoder and decoder components of the model could be separated (with the advent of BERT and GPT), and two distinct families of models were created:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encoder-only models (BERT-style, bidirectional)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encoder models used masked language modeling (MLM) as a training objective: randomly mask out a subset of tokens of each input and train the encoder to reconstruct the missing tokens (fill in the blanks). The model sees the entire (partially masked) context at once and learns bidirectional representations. This architecture excelled at tasks requiring a full‐sentence (or paragraph) representation (e.g., classification and retrieval).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decoder-only models (GPT-style, autoregressive)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decoder models used next‐token prediction as a training objective: at each position $t$, predict the token at position $t + 1$ given all tokens up to $t$ as context. Only the left context is used to predict future values (unidirectional). This architecture excelled at generative tasks where you produce text one token at a time, such as open‐ended generation, summarization, and translation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally, BERT saw immediate use in tasks such as classification, whereas GPT-style models didn’t become popular until later (due to initial limited capabilities). Eventually, the generation capabilities of autoregressive (decoder) transformers vastly improved. The general training objective of “next token prediction” means a much larger space of use cases when compared to encoder models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discrete Language Diffusion Models#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diffusion models were first popularized in image generation. In image generation, diffusion models gradually add Gaussian noise to an image (forward process) and then train a neural network to iteratively denoise it (reverse process). A high‐level summary of continuous diffusion with images is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forward process: Start from a clean image x₀, then add small amounts of (usually Gaussian) noise at each timestep until you end up with near‐pure noise.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reverse process: Train a model (often a U‐Net) to predict the noise at each timestep, gradually recovering the original image in discrete denoising steps.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applying this idea to language means we need a way to add noise to text and then remove it in stages. The simplest way to do this is a masking‐based noise process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Forward (masking) process:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;At timestep t = 0, you have a fully uncorrupted text sequence.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;At each subsequent timestep t &amp;gt; 0, randomly replace a fraction of tokens with a special &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MASK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;token according to a pre‐defined schedule (e.g., gradually increasing the masked proportion from 0% to 100%).&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;By the final timestep T, the entire sequence may be masked (all tokens are &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MASK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reverse (denoising) process:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Train a model (often a standard Transformer encoder) to predict the original token IDs given a partially masked sequence at timestep t.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;This is akin to performing masked language modeling at varying mask rates: at early timesteps, only a few tokens are masked (easy to predict); at later timesteps, many tokens are masked (harder).&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;By chaining together predictions from high‐mask‐rate back down to zero, you can recover (or generate) a full sequence.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this discrete text diffusion framework, the model learns a likelihood bound on the data distribution by optimizing a sum of denoising losses over all timesteps, rather than a single MLM objective at a fixed mask probability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we can see, BERT’s masked language modeling objective is the same training objective as text diffusion, but just for a subset of masking rates. By introducing variable masking rates (from 0 to 1) and a scheduled sequence of denoising steps (inspired by diffusion theory), we can transform BERT’s masked language modeling objective into a full generative procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;RoBERTa Diffusion#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2019, RoBERTa was released. It was essentially just an enhancement of the original BERT model, with better hyperparameters, data training size, and a more simple training objective (MLM only, removed next sentence prediction).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we use the HuggingFace &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dataset&lt;/code&gt; libraries to pull in the original RoBERTa weights, tokenizer, and the Trainer class to easily finetune the model on the WikiText dataset.
The main code (full code here) looks like this below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Load and tokenize dataset and instantiate the model
dataset = load_dataset("wikitext", "wikitext-2-raw-v1")
tokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
model = RobertaForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("roberta-base")

# Create the training args and Trainer instance
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="finetuned-roberta-diffusion",
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=NUM_EPOCHS,
    per_device_train_batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
    save_strategy="epoch",
    save_total_limit=1,
    logging_steps=200,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized["validation"],
    data_collator=diffusion_collator, # custom implementation
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

# Train &amp;amp; save
trainer.train()
trainer.save_model("finetuned-roberta-diffusion")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently we have 10 diffusion steps, so we randomly sample a percentage $p$ out of &lt;code&gt;mask_probs&lt;/code&gt; (1.0, 0.9, 0.9, &amp;amp;mldr;, 0.1) and mask that percent of the tokens each batch.
The custom &lt;code&gt;diffusion_collator&lt;/code&gt; function (see code here) samples one mask-probability &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;mask_probs&lt;/code&gt; per batch and sets each token to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MASK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; probability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be able to condition the generation on a “prompt”, we currently never mask the first 16 tokens. That means that during training, each step will always have the first 16 tokens as context for generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplified code for the &lt;code&gt;diffusion_collator&lt;/code&gt; looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  def diffusion_collator(examples):
      batch = tokenizer.pad(examples, return_tensors="pt")

      # Randomly select masking probability for this batch
      mask_prob = random.choice([1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1])

      # Never mask the first PREFIX_LEN tokens (preserved context)
      maskable_positions = batch.input_ids[:, PREFIX_LEN:]

      # Create random mask for the chosen probability
      mask = torch.rand(maskable_positions.shape) &amp;lt; mask_prob

      # Apply masking
      batch.input_ids[:, PREFIX_LEN:][mask] = tokenizer.mask_token_id
      batch.labels = batch.input_ids.clone()

      return batch&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For inference, we start with an input which is a tensor of size 256 (since we are generating blocks of 256 tokens). The first 16 positions are the token ids that correspond to the prompt, and the last 240 are just &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MASK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tokens. We iterate through the denoising schedule and each step, we generate a prediction and then remask the sequence again. The process looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Step 0: [PREFIX] &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; ...     (100% masked)
Step 1: [PREFIX] will &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; over &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; control ...        (90% masked)
Step 2: [PREFIX] will begin &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; greater control ...      (80% masked)
...
Step 10: [PREFIX] will begin to assert greater control ...  (0% masked - DONE)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplified code for generation looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Generate text through iterative denoising
for step, mask_prob in enumerate(mask_probs):
    # Forward pass: predict masked tokens
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        predictions = outputs.logits  # shape: (1, MAX_LEN, vocab_size)

    # For each masked position, sample from top-k/top-p filtered distribution
    for pos in range(PREFIX_LEN, MAX_LEN):
        if input_ids[0, pos] == tokenizer.mask_token_id:
            logits = predictions[0, pos, :]
            # Apply top-k and top-p filtering
            filtered_logits = top_k_top_p_filtering(logits, top_k=TOP_K, top_p=TOP_P)
            probs = F.softmax(filtered_logits, dim=-1)
            # Sample token
            sampled_token = torch.multinomial(probs, 1)
            input_ids[0, pos] = sampled_token

    # Re-mask a portion of non-prefix tokens for next iteration
    if mask_prob &amp;gt; 0:
        mask_indices = torch.rand(MAX_LEN - PREFIX_LEN) &amp;lt; mask_prob
        input_ids[0, PREFIX_LEN:][mask_indices] = tokenizer.mask_token_id&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is an example output generation of the fine-tuned model after training on an H200 for 30 minutes (the first line is the initial prompt):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Following their victory in the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert
greater...

...dominion over Europe beginning about the early 19th. There conflict took
place on the island, between British and Irish Ireland. British officials 
administered British Ireland, a Celtic empire under the control of the Irish 
nationalist authorities, defined as a dominion of Britain. As the newly Fortic 
states acquired independent and powerful status, many former English colonies
played their part in this new, British @-@ controlled colonial system. Following
this period the Non @-@ Parliamentaryist Party won its influence in Britain in 
1890, led by the support of settlers from the Irish colonies. Looking inwards, 
Sinclair, Lewis questioned, and debated the need to describe " The New Britain "&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The output looks surprisingly coherent! Most of the quirks present are actually just quirks from the formatting of WikiText (spaces around punctuation &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;, turning hyphens &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;@-@&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is a comparison between our diffusion model and GPT-2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see GPT-2’s output is more coherent and slightly faster (~9 seconds vs ~13) but I’m pleasantly surprised with how good my simple implementation was. It is a good proof of concept, and with new approaches like AR-Diffusion and Skip-Step Diffusion (and a more optimized implementation), the quality and speed can be drastically improved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen that masked language models like RoBERTa, originally designed for fill-in-the-blank tasks, can be repurposed into fully generative engines by interpreting variable-rate masking as a discrete diffusion process. By gradually corrupting text with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MASK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tokens and training the model to iteratively denoise at increasing mask intensities, we effectively turn the standard MLM objective into a step-by-step generation procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even without architectural changes, a fine-tuned RoBERTa can generate coherent looking text after slightly modifying the training objective, validating the idea that BERT-style models are essentially just text diffusion models trained on one masking rate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've spent the last 8 months in the RAG trenches, I want to share what actually worked vs. wasted our time. We built RAG for Usul AI (9M pages) and an unnamed legal AI enterprise (4M pages).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Langchain + Llamaindex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started out with youtube tutorials. First Langchain → Llamaindex. Got to a working prototype in a couple of days and were optimistic with the progress. We run tests on subset of the data (100 documents) and the results looked great. We spent the next few days running the pipeline on the production dataset and got everything working in a week — incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except it wasn't, the results were subpar and only the end users could tell. We spent the following few months rewriting pieces of the system, one at a time, until the performance was at the level we wanted. Here are things we did ranked by ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What moved the needle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Query Generation: not all context can be captured by the user's last query. We had an LLM review the thread and generate a number of semantic + keyword queries. We processed all of those queries in parallel, and passed them to a reranker. This made us cover a larger surface area and not be dependent on a computed score for hybrid search.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reranking: the highest value 5 lines of code you'll add. The chunk ranking shifted a lot. More than you'd expect. Reranking can many times make up for a bad setup if you pass in enough chunks. We found the ideal reranker set-up to be 50 chunk input -&amp;gt; 15 output.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chunking Strategy: this takes a lot of effort, you'll probably be spending most of your time on it. We built a custom flow for both enterprises, make sure to understand the data, review the chunks, and check that a) chunks are not getting cut mid-word or sentence b) ~each chunk is a logical unit and captures information on its own&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metadata to LLM: we started by passing the chunk text to the LLM, we ran an experiment and found that injecting relevant metadata as well (title, author, etc.) improves context and answers by a lot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Query routing: many users asked questions that can't be answered by RAG (e.g. summarize the article, who wrote this). We created a small router that detects these questions and answers them using an API call + LLM instead of the full-blown RAG set-ups.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vector database: Azure -&amp;gt; Pinecone -&amp;gt; Turbopuffer (cheap, supports keyword search natively)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Document Extraction: Custom&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chunking: Unstructured.io by default, custom for enterprises (heard that Chonkie is good)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Embedding: text-embedding-large-3, haven't tested others&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reranker: None -&amp;gt; Cohere 3.5 -&amp;gt; Zerank (less known but actually good)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLM: GPT 4.1 -&amp;gt; GPT 5 -&amp;gt; GPT 4.1, covered by Azure credits&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Claude Code on the web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we're introducing Claude Code on the web, a new way to delegate coding tasks directly from your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now in beta as a research preview, you can assign multiple coding tasks to Claude that run on Anthropic-managed cloud infrastructure, perfect for tackling bug backlogs, routine fixes, or parallel development work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Run coding tasks in parallel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code on the web lets you kick off coding sessions without opening your terminal. Connect your GitHub repositories, describe what you need, and Claude handles the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each session runs in its own isolated environment with real-time progress tracking, and you can actively steer Claude to adjust course as it’s working through tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Claude Code running in the cloud, you can now run multiple tasks in parallel across different repositories from a single interface and ship faster with automatic PR creation and clear change summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flexible for every workflow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The web interface complements your existing Claude Code workflow. Running tasks in the cloud is especially effective for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Answering questions about how projects work and how repositories are mapped&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bugfixes and routine, well-defined tasks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backend changes, where Claude Code can use test-driven development to verify changes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also use Claude Code on mobile. As part of this research preview, we’re making Claude Code available on our iOS app so developers can explore coding with Claude on the go. It’s an early preview, and we hope to quickly refine the mobile experience based on your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Security-first cloud execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every Claude Code task runs in an isolated sandbox environment with network and filesystem restrictions. Git interactions are handled through a secure proxy service that ensures Claude can only access authorized repositories—helping keep your code and credentials protected throughout the entire workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also add custom network configuration to choose what domains Claude Code can connect to from its sandbox. For example, you can allow Claude to download npm packages over the internet so that it can run tests and validate changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read our engineering blog and documentation for a deep dive on Claude Code’s sandboxing approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code on the web is available now in research preview for Pro and Max users. Visit claude.com/code to connect your first repository and start delegating tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloud-based sessions share rate limits with all other Claude Code usage. Explore our documentation to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This page is a collection of libraries and extensions to use Scheme as a production tool. By "production tools" I mean the tools to process daily chores for systems engineers and programmers---parsing files, generate reports, watching processes, providing small GUI wrappers, and all sorts of those things. Currently I'm using Perl for those purpose, but I'm always longing to use Scheme for them. So I started this page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most stuffs in this site are done as my private project at home, except the ones explicitly stated otherwise. I upload libraries even in its alpha/beta stage, since I'd like to test and use them at work, too. In a way, my primary interest is to make my life happier. No warranty comes with them, as usual, but it'll be nice if somebody else finds they are useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can read Japanese, visit the Japanese page which contains some translations of Lisp/Scheme related articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a Wiki Clone in Scheme (Gauche). Come and try it: WiLiKi.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A filter program which copies the input text to output, with processing embedded Scheme expressions. This program itself is independent from any Scheme implementation; you can use your favorite one. Useful to process text files with a bit of dynamic parts. This page itself is processed by escm to embed information such as the update time of libraries, and synchronize with Japanese version. A complete new version of escm, named aescm, is being developed by TAGA Yoshitaka ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/escm/)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the big ambitions for the search engine this year has been to enable searching in more languages than English, and a pilot project for this has just been completed, allowing experimental support for German, French and Swedish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These changes are now live for testing, but with an extremely small corpus of documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the search engine has been up to this point built with English in mind, some anglo-centric assumptions made it into its code. A lot of the research on search engines generally seems to embed similar assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As this is a domain rife with unknown unknowns, the ambition for this pilot was to implement support for just a few additional languages in order to get a feel for how much work would be required to support more languages in general, as well as to assess how much the index grows when this is done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though it was fully understood upfront that supporting all languages in one go is unrealistic, as some languages are more different than others and require significant additional work. Human language is surprisingly disparate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A language like Japanese, for example, has not only multiple alphabets, but embeds character width in unicode; on top of that the language doesn’t put spaces between words. As such the language requires special normalization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latin, on the other hand, has dozens of forms for each word, and the words can often be reordered without significantly changing the meaning of a sentence. On the one hand this makes the grammatical analysis of the language somewhat easier since the words announce their function in the sentence fairly unambiguously, but on the other you probably need to store the text in a lemmatized form, and then strongly de-prioritize word order when matching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s bungled handling of Russian was supposedly why Yandex was able to eke out a foothold in that market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What needs changing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The search engine’s language processing chain is fairly long, but the most salient parts go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text is extracted from the HTML&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language is identified using fasttext&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text is broken into sentences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Words are lowercased and Unicode is normalized&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sentences are stemmed and POS-tagged&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sentences, with stemming and POS-tag data is fed into keyword extraction algorithms&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Keywords are mapped to positions and HTML tags&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Important keywords are identified using TF-IDF (using stemmed forms)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Important keywords are identified using grammar patterns (POS-tags)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Important keywords are identified using other heuristics&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keywords are hashed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stemming is an imperfect way of getting a base form of a word, though generally such algorithms have a great number of flaws, so that e.g. universe and university seem to be the same word. This is only used in tf-idf calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a grammatical annotation process where the role of each word is as best possible identified. This helps identify named entities, subjects, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of these processes needless to say require some awareness of the language being acted upon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These “important keywords” are used to assign documents to a special index that helps with recall by ensuring these documents are included in the set that is ranked before the execution timer runs out. This is not strictly necessary, and in some cases such as where POS-tagging is not possible, can be disabled, partially or as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The normalization step is subject to cultural differences that do not translate. In English you’d probably expect to find the metal band TrÃ¶jan, typing “trojan”. In Swedish these are different letters entirely that should not match, the former means “the shirt”, the latter “trojan” in the Homeric or IT-security sense. Though a Swedish person would likely also say that they should be able to find mÃ¼(e)sli with the keyword “musli”, but a German-speaker would disagree and say that u and Ã¼ are clearly not the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There also exists a bootstrapping problem, as the statistical model used to calculate TF-IDF is based on documents in the index. Since almost all of the documents in the index up until this point have been in English, term frequencies for the newly added languages are missing. This breaks TF-IDF, as used in identifying important keywords, until a new model can be constructed. Thankfully the BM-25 model used in ranking is robust to this, as it relies on live data from the index itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic approach to parametrize language handling selected was to inject a language definition object, from which language appropriate logic is accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is configurable via XML. Here XML was chosen because it arguably has the best built-in validation support, making it a fantastic use case for a self-contained configuration file like this one, where late validation would be very annoying to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of the configuration file consists of various grammatical patterns used to identify important keywords based on the role of a word in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ngrams type="noun"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;pospattern&amp;gt;VBG&amp;lt;/pospattern&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;pospattern&amp;gt;RB VBG&amp;lt;/pospattern&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;pospattern&amp;gt;(NNP* JJ)&amp;lt;/pospattern&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;pospattern&amp;gt;(NN* JJ) NN*&amp;lt;/pospattern&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;pospattern&amp;gt;(NN* JJ) (NN* JJ) NN*&amp;lt;/pospattern&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;pospattern&amp;gt;(NN* JJ) (NN* JJ) (NN* JJ) NN*&amp;lt;/pospattern&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;pospattern&amp;gt;(NNP* JJ) (NNP* IN TO CC) NNP*&amp;lt;/pospattern&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;pospattern&amp;gt;(NNP* JJ) (NNP* IN TO CC) DT NNP*&amp;lt;/pospattern&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;pospattern&amp;gt;(NNP* JJ) (NNP* IN TO CC) (NNP* IN TO CC) NNP*&amp;lt;/pospattern&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ngrams&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An expression like &lt;code&gt;(NN* JJ) (NN* JJ) NN*&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any tag starting with &lt;code&gt;NN&lt;/code&gt;, or the tag&lt;code&gt;JJ&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any tag starting with &lt;code&gt;NN&lt;/code&gt;, or the tag&lt;code&gt;JJ&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any tag starting with &lt;code&gt;NN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously these patterns were hard coded, and finding a performant alternative implementation took some effort. A bit mask approach was selected, as it allows for some very basic bit-level concurrency that drastically reduces the number of branches needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as grammatical analysis goes, the approach used by the search engine is pretty medieval, but it does do a fairly good job at what it sets out to do, and as a result, one thing it is generally pretty good at is finding websites about some topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some ways the imperfections introduced by the old-fashioned way of approaching language processing is almost helpful in bringing in more relevant results, as they tend to capture more variations of the words related to the topic of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are more places that need minor language dependent behavior changes that are glossed over here, both in the language processing pipeline discussed above, and in the query parser, though in the interest of keeping this update from becoming an overly verbose git diff, these will be glossed over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tooling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help make sense of this, a test tool was built that runs the language processing pipeline in isolation, and outputs annotated intermediate results for human inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work in this domain poses special problems that all but demand human testing. Machine testing can be good for catching regressions or getting access to some code for easier debugging, but natural language has so many nuances that any test suite is woefully inadequate compared to a pair of human eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has already helped refine the algorithms used to identify important keywords in English, which wasn’t the intent of building the tool, but its immediate consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Integration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrating the new multi-language search data into the system poses some design considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One option would be to stick everything in one big index, and then filter results based on language during or after ranking. The strength of this is that it becomes possible to search in any language without specifying it upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drawbacks of the one-index approach is that it grows the index, which makes all queries slower; it also grows the number of keywords in the lexicon, which is something that we generally want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way the search engine handles mapping keywords to numeric ids is to use a hash algorithm. Not a hash table, but the output of the hash algorithm itself. This seems absolutely unhinged at first glance, but works remarkably well as long as the lexicon stays small enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hash collisions do happen on rare occasions, but they need to happen between words where the words actually appear in the same documents to be a problem, generally leading to the ranking algorithm having to trudge through irrelevant documents and performing worse as a result of wasting its time budget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Massively expanding the lexicon like we would if we were to mingle the documents increases the likelihood there will be an actual problem arising from these rare false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we stick every keyword from every language in the same index, a different problem arises, namely that homophones exist across different languages, meaning that the index lookup needs to wade through irrelevant documents that are trivially unrelated to the query.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The words &lt;code&gt;salt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lag&lt;/code&gt;, if they appear in the same document in English likely selects documents relating to esports, whereas in Swedish they select for documents relating to food preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternative option is to separate the indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drawback here is that you must specify the language upfront, and querying in all languages becomes very expensive, as it executing multiple queries, though the desired language of the search results are generally known beforehand so this is a relatively small concern that, at best, affects a small number of machine-access use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since it has far fewer problems, and promises to be faster and more accurate, this approach was selected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice this was implemented as language-specific keyword-document mappings, that point into a common file containing document lists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially the indexes were constructed from a common journal file, which was consumed repeatedly, but this turned out to be slow, and a partitioned approach was selected instead, with one journal per language. This almost completely removes any overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outcome&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The changes discussed above have been implemented, and upon evaluation seems to work reasonably well, though evaluation has somewhat run into a dead end, as the index itself is extremely small for the newly added languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The experience of small index is devious as it may just mean poor recall, though looking at the documents database for one index partition, this is about 12% of the index, it really is quite small!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;iso&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;document count&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;en&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;112,846,397&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;de&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7,623,983&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;fr&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,852,759&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;sv&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1,020,962&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To verify this is not due some silent, catastrophic processing error, the proportions were compared against the number of documents found in the 50 GB document sample used in testing, using a simplified process that only does language identification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;iso&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;document count&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;en&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11,497,571&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;de&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;614,311&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;fr&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;409,877&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;es&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;267,408&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ja&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;217,599&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;nl&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;196,130&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&amp;amp;mldr;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&amp;amp;mldr;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;sv&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;67,670&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proportions aren’t identical, but in the same general ballpark. The small size of the sample, along with the uneven distribution and apparent rarity of these documents adequately explains the disparity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of documents in languages other than English is likely due to how the index has been grown, by following and adding links from English websites. These occasionally lead to bilingual websites, and on rare occasions to websites completely in a different language, though it seems reasonable most websites that are not at least partially in English sees few or no links from English-language websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding to the problem, up until fairly recently the index wasn’t really growing very much at all, only through manual submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond a certain point, meaningfully growing the index by just following links became difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most known domains are dead, so merely adding more domains to the list of websites to crawl only serves to pollute the database with junk data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to get around this, and reach the goal of indexing a billion documents, a new process was built to visit candidate websites to verify that they are in fact real and on-line, before assigning them to an index partition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process has been running for almost a quarter, and has managed to identify about 800,000 viable new domains in that time window. (This has brought the document total up to 969M documents. So very nearly there now!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web search is unusual in how often you run into these extremely long running processes that need to cook for months, sometimes up to a year before they really begin to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll have to see whether building this new process was so prescient it ends up being sufficient to identify and add new domains in more languages, as links from the newly processed Swedish, French and German websites have been added to the domain database, or if some sort of manual seeding or targeted selection process is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems plausible it will at least begin to remedy the data starvation, as the rate of successful domain discovery has shot up significantly since processing links from the documents processed in the newly added languages, and many of the new domains are indeed from &lt;code&gt;.de&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.se&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.fr&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.ch&lt;/code&gt; domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now we’ll have to wait and see how the data-set evolves. It is difficult to further refine the multi-language aspect of the search data with a data-set this small.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PASTA/80 is a simple Pascal cross compiler targeting the Z80 microprocessor. It generates code for these classic and modern machines:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler follows the single-pass recursive-descent approach championed by Niklaus Wirth, inventor of Pascal, in his books and lectures. It doesn't have an explicit syntax tree, but instead generates code on the fly during parsing. As a result, the compiler might not always generate the most efficient code possible (it definitely cannot compete with LLVM and doesn't try to), but it's very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The supported Pascal dialect is an almost exact clone of the original Turbo Pascal 3.0 for CP/M (see this manual for details). So you have at your disposal the following language elements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All the basic data types (&lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Byte&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Pointer&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Real&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;array of&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;record&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;set of&lt;/code&gt;, enumerations, subranges and pointers as a way of building new data types.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The decision-making elements &lt;code&gt;if..then..else&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;case..of&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The loop elements &lt;code&gt;for..do&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;while..do&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;repeat..until&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;with..do&lt;/code&gt;notation for "opening" records.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;procedure&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt;including value and&lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;parameters and nesting.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The standard procedures for screen input and output (i.e. &lt;code&gt;ReadLn&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;WriteLn&lt;/code&gt;etc.).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All conversion and utility procedures and functions that Turbo Pascal 3.0 had.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The three kinds of disk files, that is untyped (&lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt;), typed (&lt;code&gt;file of&lt;/code&gt;) and&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A dynamic heap of up to 32767 bytes with &lt;code&gt;GetMem&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;FreeMem&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;New&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inline assembly (via opcodes, not via mnemonics, so this page might be handy).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Overlays (in memory, Spectrum 128K and Next only, see below).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some compiler directives: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$i &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;for including Pascal source files (including nesting and cycle detection)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$l &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;for including an assembly file (aka "linking" a library)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$a(+/-)&lt;/code&gt;for enabling or disabling absolute mode (default is on, disable for recursion)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$i(+/-)&lt;/code&gt;for enabling or disabling IO checking (when off, check&lt;code&gt;IOResult&lt;/code&gt;after calls)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$k(+/-)&lt;/code&gt;for enabling or disabling stack overflow checking&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$u(+/-)&lt;/code&gt;for enabling or disabling Ctrl-C checking&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler also has some features that were borrowed from or inspired by later versions of Turbo Pascal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;C-style &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;one-line comments in addition to&lt;code&gt;{..}&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;(*..*)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Binary literals (using a &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;prefix).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Break&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Continue&lt;/code&gt;for loop control.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Querying the keyboard via &lt;code&gt;KeyPressed&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;ReadKey&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Color support via &lt;code&gt;TextColor&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;TextBackground&lt;/code&gt;with constants for the 8 Spectrum Next colors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Inc&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Dec&lt;/code&gt;for more efficient increasing and decreasing of variables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Include&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Exclude&lt;/code&gt;for more efficient handling of sets.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A simple &lt;code&gt;Assert&lt;/code&gt;facility that counts passes/fails and shows the failed line number.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since that covers most of the functionality of Turbo Pascal 3 you might ask what is missing. These are the current limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All the remaining compiler directives are not yet supported.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mark&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt;are not currently supported.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The standard files &lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Output&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Kbd&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Con&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Lst&lt;/code&gt;are not supported.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Chain&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Execute&lt;/code&gt;are not supported.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add-on libraries from the PC version of Turbo Pascal 3.0 are not yet supported (although there are a few graphics primitives for the ZX targets).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new instructions of the Z80N CPU inside the ZX Spectrum Next are not yet being leveraged.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No separate compilation. Everything is compiled from source, always.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Binary size is quite large compared to the original.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The runtime library, being partially written in Pascal itself, gets quite large when compiled. I hope to bring this down again by reimplementing more of it in Z80 assembly (or improve the code generator, which, although it has a peephole optimizer, is not generating super-efficient Z80 code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler is itself written in Pascal. You can compile it with Free Pascal (I use version 3.2.2). Just run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ fpc pasta&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pascal compiler generates Z80 assembler code and relies on sjasmplus as a backend for the final translation step to binary. It can also, in &lt;code&gt;--ide&lt;/code&gt; mode (see below), make use of various other external tools. The compiler tries to detect these external tools automatically (from your system's &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;), but sometimes it's best to create a file &lt;code&gt;.pasta80.cfg&lt;/code&gt; in your home directory specifying necessary paths (there is a sample in &lt;code&gt;misc&lt;/code&gt; that you can adapt).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# PASTA/80 config

HOME      = ~/Spectrum/pasta80
ASSEMBLER = ~/Spectrum/sjasmplus/sjasmplus
...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can check your whole setup by calling the compiler with &lt;code&gt;--config&lt;/code&gt;. It will show the full paths of all internal and external requirements and whether they are fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run the compiler just invoke the executable with the name of a Pascal source file to translate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default target is CP/M. There is an optional parameter that enables some simple peephole optimizations and another one that uses dependency analysis to eliminate unused Pascal procedures and functions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ pasta hello.pas             # Compiles hello.pas to hello.com
$ pasta hello                 # Source file .pas suffix is optional
$ pasta --opt hello.pas       # Enables peephole optimizations
$ pasta --opt --dep hello.pas # The same plus dependency analysis&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can run the resulting &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; files on a real CP/M machine or in a CP/M emulator. I recommend the excellent tnylpo. For programs that use VT52 control codes you have to start tnylpo in full-screen mode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ tnylpo hello                # Run in line-mode
$ tnylpo -s -t @ hello        # Monochrome full-screen, wait when finished
$ tnylpo -soy,4,0 -t @ hello  # Color full-screen, wait when finished&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;"Hello, World" in line mode&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;"Hello, World" in full-screen&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To generate binaries for the ZX Spectrum 48K, 128K and Next targets, use the &lt;code&gt;--zx48&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--zx128&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--zxnext&lt;/code&gt; parameters, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ pasta --zx48 hello.pas      # Compiles for ZX Spectrum 48K
$ pasta --zx128 hello.pas     # Compiles for ZX Spectrum 48K
$ pasta --zxnext hello.pas    # Compiles for ZX Spectrum Next&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main difference between the three (currently) is that the ZX Spectrum Next target supports file IO (on the SD card), while the other two do not. The remaining routines are mostly the same. Screen output is handled via &lt;code&gt;rst $10&lt;/code&gt; in the ROM. In both cases the binaries are expected to be run from address 0x8000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default output format for the ZX Spectrum targets is a simple binary file that contains exactly the bytes of the compiled program (plus a +3DOS header when compiling for the Spectrum Next). In addition to that (and for more complex cases involving overlays), the compiler can also generate snapshot files or tape files, the latter including a suitable BASIC loader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ pasta --zx48 --sna examples/hello.pas   # .sna file
$ pasta --zx48 --tap examples/jacques.pas # .tap file with BASIC loader&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being self-contained, snapshots and tapes are a convenient way to distribute your programs and to launch them an emulator, such as Fuse:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ open -a Fuse examples/hello.sna         # Launch .sna file in FUSE (on Mac)
$ open -a Fuse examples/jacques.tap       # Launch .tap file in FUSE (on Mac)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Hello world in FUSE&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Frere Jacques in FUSE (yes, with sound!)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When compiling for the Next, another useful format is a runnable directory. It contains exactly the same files that would also be in the .tap file, including a BASIC loader named &lt;code&gt;run.bas&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ pasta --zxnext --run examples/pq.pas    # Results in directory named pq.run&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The directory has the suffix &lt;code&gt;.run&lt;/code&gt;. When attempting to enter such a directory in the Next's file browser, the loader is started automatically (press Symbol Shift + Enter to really see the contents). If you are a Mac user: Yes, it's a bit like an &lt;code&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Spectrum 128K and Next targets support overlays. This means you can have larger programs than would normally fit into the 64K address space of a Z80 machine. The rules are the same as for Turbo Pascal 3.0:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Overlays can be applied to global procedures and functions only, not to nested ones (though nested ones will be overlayed if the containing ones are, too).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Overlays cannot be applied to global variables, that is, you cannot use them for data (at least not without tricks).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All consecutive procedures and functions that are marked as &lt;code&gt;overlay&lt;/code&gt;go into the same overlay. Use any declaration inbetween to separate overlays.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the following example, there are three overlays: Overlay 0 contains A and B, overlay 1 contains D, and overlay 2 contains E.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;overlay procedure A; (* Overlay 0 *)
begin
end;

overlay procedure B; (* Overlay 0 *)
begin
end;

procedure C; (* Not in an overlay *)
begin
end;

overlay procedure D; (* Overlay 1 *)
begin
end;

type
  Dummy = Integer;   (* Separator *)

overlay procedure E; (* Overlay 2 *)
begin
end;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast to Turbo Pascal 3.0, overlays are not implemented via disk files. Instead, they use the additional RAM of the Spectrum 128K and Next machines. The uppermost 16K bank (Spectrum 128K) or 8K page (Spectrum Next) will be reserved for overlays. Each overlay can have a maximum size of 8K. The compiler manages everything and generates special "far calls" whenever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable overlays, use the &lt;code&gt;--ovr&lt;/code&gt; command line parameter, ideally in conjuncton with the &lt;code&gt;--tap&lt;/code&gt; parameter, as the tape loaders for 128K and Next are fully overlay-aware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ pasta --zx128 --tap --opt --dep --ovr tests/all.pas # Test suite as 128K tape&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler prints a report of which overlays go into which RAM banks or pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without the &lt;code&gt;--ovr&lt;/code&gt; parameter, overlay markers are simply ignored. This means you can use the same source code for platforms that do support overlays and for those that don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Caution: Overlays somewhat break the safety of the Pascal language. Be careful when using pointers or &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; parameters for passing data between overlays. The memory you refer to may have just been paged out! It might make sense to compile your overlays with &lt;code&gt;{$a-}&lt;/code&gt;, so that all local variables are stored on the stack (which is always visible).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a folder containing &lt;code&gt;examples&lt;/code&gt; and a folder containing &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; for the compiler. The main test suite &lt;code&gt;all.pas&lt;/code&gt; needs to be compiled with &lt;code&gt;--opt --dep&lt;/code&gt; because of its size. Otherwise it won't fit into 64K. The Spectrum 128K and Next targets can (only) handle it using overlays, the Spectrum 48K target can't. Both the examples and the tests should give you a pretty good overview of what the compiler can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also solved all puzzles of Advent of Code 2022 with an earlier version of the compiler and made YouTube videos of the solutions running on the ZX Spectrum Next, in CP/M mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a fun little gimmick the compiler can be started like this&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ pasta --ide&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to run it in an interactive mode that has an interface reminiscient of Turbo Pascal 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Main menu&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Editor&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When started in an ordinary terminal, this mode relies on the editor &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt; being present on your system (on MacOS you might want to install the real &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt; via a package manager because Apple sells you the much more limited &lt;code&gt;pico&lt;/code&gt; editor as &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also run it in a shell within Visual Studio Code, in which case it would automatically use VSC's editor (via the &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; command, which, on a Mac, you might have to make available from VCS's settings) and act a bit like a plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following external tools are supported for running compiled programs on the host machine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;tnylpo for CP/M programs (press &amp;lt;R&amp;gt; for line mode, &amp;lt;Shift-R&amp;gt; for full-screen mode).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fuse for programs targeting the ZX Spectrum 48K and 128K machines.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CSpect for ZX Spectrum Next programs. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Please have hdfmonkey ready for manipulating the SD card image.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you're on MacOS or Linux, you also need &lt;code&gt;mono&lt;/code&gt;because CSpect is a .NET application.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, everything that is in your &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; should be detected automatically. There are some exceptions, though, so it makes sense to copy &lt;code&gt;misc/.pasta80.cfg&lt;/code&gt; to your home directory and adapt it. Use the &lt;code&gt;--config&lt;/code&gt; parameter to let PASTA/80 check your setup and get feedback on what is in place and what is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following screenshots show some applications compiled for the CP/M target and running in the &lt;code&gt;tnylpo&lt;/code&gt; emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Diamond Blankets Will Keep Future Chips Cool&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A micrometers-thick integrated layer spreads out the heat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s stunning computing power is allowing us to move from human intelligence toward artificial intelligence. And as our machines gain more power, they’re becoming not just tools but decision-makers shaping our future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with great power comes great…heat!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nanometer-scale transistors switch at gigahertz speeds, electrons race through circuits, losing energy as heat—which you feel when your laptop or your phone toasts your fingers. As we’ve crammed more and more transistors onto chips, we’ve lost the room to release that heat efficiently. Instead of the heat spreading out quickly across the silicon, which makes it much easier to remove, it builds up to form hot spots, which can be tens of degrees warmer than the rest of the chip. That extreme heat forces systems to throttle the performance of CPUs and GPUs to avoid degrading the chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, what began as a quest for miniaturization has turned into a battle against thermal energy. This challenge extends across all electronics. In computing, high-performance processors demand ever-increasing power densities. (New Nvidia GPU B300 servers will consume nearly 15 kilowatts of power.) In communication, both digital and analog systems push transistors to deliver more power for stronger signals and faster data rates. In the power electronics used for energy conversion and distribution, efficiency gains are being countered by thermal constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to grow large-grained polycrystalline diamond at low temperature led to a new way to combat heat in transistors. Mohamadali Malakoutian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than allowing heat to build up, what if we could spread it out right from the start, inside the chip?—diluting it like a cup of boiling water dropped into a swimming pool. Spreading out the heat would lower the temperature of the most critical devices and circuits and let the other time-tested cooling technologies work more efficiently. To do that, we’d have to introduce a highly thermally conductive material inside the IC, mere nanometers from the transistors, without messing up any of their very precise and sensitive properties. Enter an unexpected material—diamond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, diamond is ideal. It’s one of the most thermally conductive materials on the planet—many times more efficient than copper—yet it’s also electrically insulating. However, integrating it into chips is tricky: Until recently we knew how to grow it only at circuit-slagging temperatures in excess of 1,000 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my research group at Stanford University has managed what seemed impossible. We can now grow a form of diamond suitable for spreading heat, directly atop semiconductor devices at low enough temperatures that even the most delicate interconnects inside advanced chips will survive. To be clear, this isn’t the kind of diamond you see in jewelry, which is a large single crystal. Our diamonds are a polycrystalline coating no more than a couple of micrometers thick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits could be huge. In some of our earliest gallium-nitride radio-frequency transistors, the addition of diamond dropped the device temperature by more than 50 °C. At the lower temperature, the transistors amplified X-band radio signals five times as well as before. We think our diamond will be even more important for advanced CMOS chips. Researchers predict that upcoming chipmaking technologies could make hot spots almost 10 °C hotter [see , “Future Chips Will Be Hotter Than Ever”, in this issue]. That’s probably why our research is drawing intense interest from the chip industry, including Applied Materials, Samsung, and TSMC. If our work continues to succeed as it has, heat will become a far less onerous constraint in CMOS and other electronics too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where Heat Begins and Ends in Chips&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the boundary between the diamond and the semiconductor, a thin layer of silicon carbide forms. It acts as a bridge for heat to flow into the diamond. Mohamadali Malakoutian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat starts within transistors and the interconnects that link them, as the flow of current meets resistance. That means most of it is generated near the surface of the semiconductor substrate. From there it rises either through layers of metal and insulation or through the semiconductor itself, depending on the package architecture. The heat then encounters a thermal interface material designed to spread it out before it ultimately reaches a heat sink, a radiator, or some sort of liquid cooling, where air or fluid carries the heat away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dominant cooling strategies today center around advances in heat sinks, fans, and radiators. In pursuit of even better cooling, researchers have explored liquid cooling using microfluidic channels and removing heat using phase-change materials. Some computer clusters go so far as to submerge the servers in thermally conductive, dielectric—electrically insulating—liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These innovations are critical steps forward, but they still have limitations. Some are so expensive they’re worthwhile only for the highest-performing chips; others are simply too bulky for the job. (Your smartphone can’t carry a conventional fan.) And none are likely to be very effective as we move toward chip architectures resembling silicon skyscrapers that stack multiple layers of chips. Such 3D systems are only as viable as our ability to remove heat from every layer within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big problem is that chip materials are poor heat conductors, so the heat becomes trapped and concentrated, causing the temperature to skyrocket within the chip. At higher temperatures, transistors leak more current, wasting power; they age more quickly, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat spreaders allow the heat to move laterally, diluting it and allowing the circuits to cool. But they’re positioned far—relatively, of course—from where the heat is generated, and so they’re of little help with these hot spots. We need a heat-spreading technology that can exist within nanometers of where the heat is generated. This is where our new low-temperature diamond could be essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to Make Diamonds&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my lab turned to developing diamond as a heat-spreading material, we were working on it as a semiconductor. In its single-crystal form—like the kind on your finger—it has a wide bandgap and ability to withstand enormous electric fields. Single-crystalline diamond also offers some of the highest thermal conductivity recorded in any material, reaching 2,200 to 2,400 watts per meter per kelvin—roughly six times as conductive as copper. Polycrystalline diamond—an easier to make material—can approach these values when grown thick. Even in this form, it outperforms copper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As attractive as diamond transistors might be, I was keenly aware—based on my experience researching gallium nitride devices—of the long road ahead. The problem is one of scale. Several companies are working to scale high-purity diamond substrates to 50, 75, and even 100 millimeters but the diamond substrates we could acquire commercially were only about 3 mm across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors were an ideal test case for diamond cooling. The devices are 3D and the critical heat-generating part, the two-dimensional electron gas, is close to the surface. Chris Philpot&lt;/p&gt;So we decided instead to try growing diamond films on large silicon wafers, in the hope of moving toward commercial-scale diamond substrates. In general, this is done by reacting methane and hydrogen at high temperatures, 900 °C or more. This results in not a single crystal but a forest of narrow columns. As they grow taller, the nanocolumns coalesce into a uniform film, but by the time they form high-quality polycrystalline diamond, the film is already very thick. This thick growth adds stress to the material and often leads to cracking and other problems.&lt;p&gt;But what if we used this polycrystalline coating as a heat spreader for other devices? If we could get diamond to grow within nanometers of transistors, get it to spread heat both vertically and laterally, and integrate it seamlessly with the silicon, metal, and dielectric in chips, it might do the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were good reasons to think it would work. Diamond is electrically insulating, and it has a relatively low dielectric constant. That means it makes a poor capacitor, so signals sent through diamond-encrusted interconnects might not degrade much. Thus diamond could act as a “thermal dielectric,” one that is electrically insulating but thermally conducting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polycrystalline diamond could help reduce temperatures inside 3D chips. Diamond thermal vias would grow inside micrometers-deep holes so heat can flow from vertically from one chip to a diamond heat spreader in another chip that’s stacked atop it. Dennis Rich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our plan to work, we were going to have to learn to grow diamond differently. We knew there wasn’t room to grow a thick film inside a chip. We also knew the narrow, spiky crystal pillars made in the first part of the growth process don’t transmit heat laterally very well, so we’d need to grow large-grained crystals from the start to get the heat moving horizontally. A third problem was that the existing diamond films didn’t form a coating on the sides of devices, which would be important for inherently 3D devices. But the biggest impediment was the high temperature needed to grow the diamond film, which would damage, if not destroy, an IC’s circuits. We were going to have to cut the growth temperature at least in half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just lowering the temperature doesn’t work. (We tried: You wind up, basically, with soot, which is electrically conductive—the opposite of what’s needed.) We found that adding oxygen to the mix helped, because it continuously etched away carbon deposits that weren’t diamond. And through extensive experimentation, we were able to find a formula that produced coatings of large-grained polycrystalline diamond all around devices at 400 °C, which is a survivable temperature for CMOS circuits and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thermal Boundary Resistance&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we had found a way to grow the right kind of diamond coatings, we faced another critical challenge—the phonon bottleneck, also known as thermal boundary resistance (TBR). Phonons are packets of heat energy, in the way that photons are packets of electromagnetic energy. Specifically, they’re a quantized version of the vibration of a crystal lattice. These phonons can pile up at the boundary between materials, resisting the flow of heat. Reducing TBR has long been a goal in thermal interface engineering, and it is often done by introducing different materials at the boundary. But semiconductors are compatible only with certain materials, limiting our choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thermal scaffolding would link layers of heat-spreading polycrystalline diamond in one chip to those in another chip in a 3D-stacked silicon. The thermal pillars would traverse each chip’s interconnects and dielectric material to move heat vertically through the stack. Srabanti Chowdhury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, we got lucky. While growing diamond on GaN capped with silicon nitride, we observed something unexpected: The measured TBR was much lower than prior reports led us to expect. (The low TBR was independently measured, initially by Martin Kuball at the University of Bristol, in England, and later by Samuel Graham Jr., then at Georgia Tech, who both have been coauthors and collaborators in several of our papers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through further investigation of the interface science and engineering, and in collaboration with K.J. Cho at the University of Texas at Dallas, we identified the cause of the lower TBR. Intermixing at the interface between the diamond and silicon nitride led to the formation of silicon carbide, which acted as a kind of bridge for the phonons, allowing more efficient heat transfer. Though this began as a scientific discovery, its technological impact was immediate—with a silicon carbide interface, our devices exhibited significantly improved thermal performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GaN HEMTs: The First Test Case&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We began testing our new low-TBR diamond coatings in gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs). These devices amplify RF signals by controlling current through a two-dimensional electron gas that forms within its channel. We leveraged the pioneering research on HEMTs done by Umesh Mishra’s laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I had been a graduate student. The Mishra lab invented a particular form of the material called N-polar gallium nitride. Their N-polar GaN HEMTs demonstrate exceptional power density at high frequencies, particularly in the W-band, the 75- to 110-gigahertz part of the microwave spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RELATED: Gallium Nitride and Silicon Carbide Fight for Green Tech Domination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made these HEMTs such a good test case is one defining feature of the device: The gate, which controls the flow of current through the device, is within tens of nanometers of the transistor’s channel. That means that heat is generated very close to the surface of the device, and any interference our diamond coating could cause would quickly show in the device’s operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We introduced the diamond layer so that it surrounded the HEMT completely, even on the sides. By maintaining a growth temperature below 400 °C, we hoped to preserve core device functionality. While we did see some decline in high-frequency performance, the thermal benefits were substantial—channel temperatures dropped by a remarkable 70 °C. This breakthrough could be a potentially transformative solution for RF systems, allowing them to operate at higher power than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Diamond in CMOS&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wondered if our diamond layer could also work in high-power CMOS chips. My colleagues at Stanford, H.-S. Philip Wong and Subhasish Mitra, have long championed 3D-stacked chip architectures. In CMOS computing chips, 3D stacking appears to be the most viable way forward to increase integration density, improve performance, and overcome the limitations of traditional transistor scaling. It’s already used in some advanced AI chips, such as AMD’s MI300 series. And it’s established in the high-bandwidth memory chips that pump data through Nvidia GPUs and other AI processors. The multiple layers of silicon in these 3D stacks are mostly connected by microscopic balls of solder, or in some advanced cases just by their copper terminals. Getting signals and power out of these stacks requires vertical copper links that burrow through the silicon to reach the chip package’s substrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of our discussions, Mitra pointed out that a critical issue with 3D-stacked chips is the thermal bottlenecks that form within the stack. In 3D architectures, the traditional heat sinks and other techniques used for 2D chips aren’t sufficient. Extracting heat from each layer is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research could redefine thermal management across industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our experiments on thermal boundary resistance in GaN suggested a similar approach would work in silicon. And when we integrated diamond with silicon, the results were remarkable: An interlayer of silicon carbide formed, leading to diamond with an excellent thermal interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our effort introduced the concept of thermal scaffolding. In that scheme, nanometers-thick layers of polycrystalline diamond would be integrated within the dielectric layers above the transistors to spread heat. These layers would then be connected by vertical heat conductors, called thermal pillars, made of copper or more diamond. These pillars would connect to another heat spreader, which in turn would link to thermal pillars on the next chip in the 3D stack, and so on until the heat reached the heat sink or other cooling device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more tiers of computing silicon in a 3D chip, the bigger difference thermal scaffolding makes. An AI accelerator with more than five tiers would well exceed typical temperature limits unless the scaffolding was employed. Srabanti Chowdhury&lt;/p&gt;In a collaboration with Mitra, we used simulations of heat generated by real computational workloads to operate a proof-of-concept structure. This structure consisted of dummy heaters to mimic hot spots in a two-chip stack along with diamond heat spreaders and copper thermal pillars. Using this, we reduced the temperature to one-tenth its value without the scaffolding.&lt;p&gt;There are hurdles still to overcome. In particular, we still have to figure out a way to make the top of our diamond coatings atomically flat. But, in collaboration with industry partners and researchers, we are systematically studying that problem and other scientific and technological issues. We and our partners think this research could offer a disruptive new path for thermal management and a crucial step toward sustaining high-performance computing into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Developing Diamond Thermal Solutions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now intend to move toward industry integration. For example, we’re working with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Threads program, which aims to use device-level thermal management to develop highly efficient and reliable X-band power amplifiers with a power density 6 to 8 times as efficient as today’s devices. The program, which was conceived and initially run by Tom Kazior, is a critical platform for validating the use of low-temperature diamond integration in GaN HEMT manufacturing. It’s enabled us to collaborate closely with industry teams while protecting both our and our partners’ processes. Defense applications demand exceptional reliability, and our diamond-integrated HEMTs are undergoing rigorous testing with industry partners. The early results are promising, guiding refinements in growth processes and integration techniques that we’ll make with our partners over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our vision extends beyond GaN HEMTs to other materials and particularly silicon computational chips. For the latter, we have an established collaboration with TSMC, and we’re expanding on newer opportunities with Applied Materials, Micron, Samsung, and others through the Stanford SystemX Alliance and the Semiconductor Research Corp. This is an extraordinary level of collaboration among otherwise fierce competitors. But then, heat is a universal challenge in chip manufacturing, and everyone is motivated to find the best solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, our research could redefine thermal management across industries. In my work on gallium nitride devices, I have seen firsthand how once-radical ideas like this transition to become industry standards, and I believe diamond-based heat extraction will follow the same trajectory, becoming a critical enabler for a generation of electronics that is no longer hindered by heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article appears in the November 2025 print issue as “Diamond Blankets Will Chill Future Chips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Better Computing Through CPU Cooling ›&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Radio We Could Send to Hell ›&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Gallium Oxide: The Supercharged Semiconductor ›&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year my side project of choice was to create a brand new game for Palm OS, it started out as something that I thought I would finish in a month but ended up taking more than half a year in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me present you with StarGrid, a space themed strategy game played on a hexagonal grid:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;StarGrid is a turn-based strategy game for Palm OS where you command a fleet of ships in a battle for control of the galaxy. Capture enemy flags, outmaneuver opposing fleets, and defend your own base in tense, tactical matches. Every move counts, will you strike boldly or play the long game to claim victory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Palm OS device at hand? No problem, just play it on your browser thanks to the CloudPilot emulator.&lt;/p&gt;Game download and in-browser emulator&lt;p&gt;Allot of 'manual' labor went into this game, no premade game engine, no additional sdk's. Just making it from scratch, trying to solve one technical puzzle after another, but learning so many neat things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coding for Palm certainly comes with it's own obstacles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Memory is tight so you need to take into account devices that can't even keep the playing field into memory, solution there was to hide the tiles when ships are moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Maximum code size itself is also very limited, requiring you to segment your application into multiple individual parts. Detailed documentation on this was long gone, so I had to scrap some info together from developers that uploaded their 25 year old code to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can follow along the blog posts to see how I got here:&lt;/p&gt;StarGrid: A new game I'm making for Palm OS in 2025 Building the CPU Player for StarGrid Moving out of the vaporware phase - StarGrid's alpha release for PalmOS is here! StarGrid for Palm OS almost ready (and why do my side projects always explode in scope)&lt;p&gt;Here's a video when playtesting the game on multiple Palm devices (cpu vs cpu action):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won't immediately jump into the next big sideproject, I think I need a breather. I do however have some ideas lined up that I've been wanting to explore for a while now:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- making a top-down racing game (think micromachines)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- create an Outrun or Lotus III-like racing game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- building a ray-tracing game (like wolf3d).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much more exciting stuff to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's my way of keeping my favorite handheld operating system alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now I hope at least some people will enjoy playing StarGrid and even if it's not their cup of tea, the game is fully open source, so I hope that can contribute to others making games and applications for this not-so-forgotten platform called Palm OS.&lt;/p&gt;StarGrid on GitHub&lt;p&gt;RetroGames, PalmOS, Development, StarGrid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get in touch through Mastodon:&lt;/p&gt;@rxpz@social.linux.pizza&lt;p&gt;StarGrid has arrived, a Brand-New Palm OS Strategy Game in 2025! was published on 2025-10-21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As of October 2025, speech LLMs suck. Many LLMs have voice interfaces, but they usually work by transcribing your speech, generating the answer in text, and using text-to-speech to read the response out loud. That’s perfectly fine in many cases (see Unmute), but it’s a wrapper, not real speech understanding. The model can’t hear the frustration in your voice and respond with empathy, it can’t emphasize important words in its answer, it cannot sense sarcasm, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, there are LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, Qwen, Moshi) that understand and generate speech natively. But in practice, they’re either not as smart, or they behave like text model wrappers. Try asking any of them “Am I speaking in a low voice or a high voice?” in a high-pitched voice, and they won’t be able to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, speech LLMs lag behind text LLMs. But why? For text, we found out a few years ago that if you take a lot of text data, a big Transformer, and a lot of GPUs, you’ll get some pretty damn good text continuation models. Why can’t we just replace text with audio and get pretty damn good speech continuation models?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a teaser, here’s what happens when you try to do that naively (warning, loud):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll have a look at why audio is harder to model than text and how we can make it easier with neural audio codecs, the de-facto standard way of getting audio into and out of LLMs. With a codec, we can turn audio into larger discrete tokens, train models to predict continuations for these tokens, and then decode those back into audio: see animation above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyutai folks have done a lot of work in this space, which is part of the reason I chose to cover this topic. We’ll start from the basics and build up all the way to Mimi, our neural audio codec. It was originally developed for Moshi and later adopted by others for their models, notably Sesame’s CSM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To tokenize text, everybody uses a technique called byte-pair encoding and rarely changes the tokenizer: OpenAI has been using the same tokenizer since GPT-4o, an ancient model if you count in LLM years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can even get decent results without tokenizing text at all, just predicting individual characters. One of the first posts that got me excited about machine learning was Andrej Karpathy’s RNN effectiveness blog post from 2015. Karpathy trains a three-layer LSTM on a single GPU and gets it to generate decent-looking code and LaTeX:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember this was ten years ago, back when we didn’t even know that attention is all we need. Now compare Karpathy’s results to a sample from WaveNet, a model DeepMind published a year later:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Purely acoustically, the audio sounds good, but it rarely even manages to produce a single correct English word. We can’t be too hard on WaveNet, though. The samples from Karpathy’s RNNs are only a few thousand characters long, but this 10-second audio consists of 160k audio samples, and WaveNet creates it by painstakingly predicting sample-by-sample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to build models that are coherent over time scales this long, and the model also takes very long to run for so many steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So instead of running the model to predict the samples one-by-one directly, we’d like to train a model to compress the audio into a more manageable size. We could compress the audio, use an LLM to predict a continuation in the compressed representation, and then decompress the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But first, let’s get a baseline model by generating audio sample by sample, like WaveNet does. The code for all of these experiments is open-source! Check it out here. I forked Andrej Karpathy’s nanoGPT repo, a simple implementation of GPT-2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text and audio are kind of the same from the perspective of the language model: it’s just tokens in, tokens out. The only thing we need to do is to quantize the continuous values of the samples into discrete buckets. Like WaveNet, we’ll use the "μ-law algorithm" to get 256 buckets. We’ll treat those as 256 possible tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s train a language model on audio tokenized like this. For the dataset, we’ll use the Libri-Light dataset, following AudioLM (with Neil Zeghidour, Eugene Kharitonov). Its train split contains 50k hours in total, but we’ll go with 1000 hours for this experiment. With this sample-by-sample tokenization, we end up with a dataset of 53 GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We train a small-ish transformer of 151.28M parameters, about the size of the smallest GPT-2 variant. When we sample from the model, it makes babbling sounds (warning, loud at times!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often, it goes into a “crackling mode” that it can’t seem to get out of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also trained a smaller model, which I teased at the beginning. It’s prone to generate nightmare fuel screeches (loud!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can tell, we’re not AGI yet. It sounds speech-like, but you can’t make out a single word and the voice keeps changing. No wonder: the context size of the model is 2048, which, for 16 kHz audio, translates to 128ms, not even a the length of one word. Also, these 10-second examples took 30 minutes to generate on an H100, so we’re a few orders of magnitude away from being real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s build a neural audio codec to compress the audio. The hope is that if we reduce the sampling rate 100x, the model will also become “100x more coherent”. An old idea in machine learning is to do this using an autoencoder: a model that takes an input, compresses it into a smaller “latent space”, and then tries to reconstruct the original input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our case, we’ll want an autoencoder whose latent space is quantized so that we can feed the latents into a language model and produce continuations. (You can generate continuations with unquantized latents, but it’s trickier – see the Further reading section.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bear with me, because we’ll take a detour from audio: let’s build a quantized autoencoder on images from Fashion MNIST. We’ll take a subset with the first three classes: t-shirt/top, trouser, and pullover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s train a regular autoencoder to encode the images into two-dimensional space:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each frame shows one batch of training, with some batches skipped. The little images are the autoencoder’s reconstructions for the images in the batch. I’ve added colors for the three classes (t-shirt/top=blue trousers=green, pullover=yellow), but the autoencoder doesn’t get a class as input – the space just naturally clusters by class. Let's zoom in on a few reconstructions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can tell, the reconstruction quality is not great. The images are blurry and the first two images are reconstructed to nearly the same thing. But we used a tiny network (4 fully connected layers for the encoder and decoder each) and projected into a mere two dimensions, so we can’t expect too much of our model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s quantize these embeddings using a clustering. We’ll do something like k-means: we’ll maintain a list of the positions of the cluster centers. We initialize the positions randomly. For each training batch, we look at which embeddings would go to each cluster. (We don’t modify the embeddings, we just look at the assignment). Then we’ll nudge each cluster center towards the average position of these embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, if a center is unused for a while, we teleport it to a random embedding from the batch, because otherwise it has no way to get unstuck from its current position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see the reconstructions of the cluster centers getting refined over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we’ll make the encoder and decoder themselves better at handling quantized embeddings during training, because currently, we’re just fitting the clustering on top of an autoencoder that is not “aware” it’s being quantized. We’d like the autoencoder to adapt to the quantization as we train it. Currently, we’re doing this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;x = get_batch()
z = encoder(x)

x_reconstructed = decoder(z)

loss = reconstruction_loss(x, x_reconstructed)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of feeding the unquantized embedding into the decoder, we’ll first move it to the closest cluster:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;x = get_batch()
z = encoder(x)

z_quantized = to_nearest_cluster(z)     # 👈
x_reconstructed = decoder(z_quantized)  # 👈

loss = reconstruction_loss(x, x_reconstructed)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a snag: if we do this, we won’t be able to train the autoencoder any more, because the quantization operation is not differentiable, meaning there is no gradient flowing from the loss to the weights of the encoder. Essentially, we’re no longer able to answer the question: “if I want the loss to decrease a bit, in which direction should I nudge the encoder’s weights?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll fix this problem by pretending it doesn’t exist. Yes, really. We’ll think of &lt;code&gt;z_quantized&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; moved by an arbitrary vector that doesn’t affect the gradient. That will make the gradient of &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; equal to that of &lt;code&gt;z_quantized&lt;/code&gt;, which is why this is also known as the straight-through estimator of the gradient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;x = get_batch()
z = encoder(x)

residual = z - to_nearest_cluster(z)
# .detach() means "forget that this needs a gradient"
z_quantized = z - residual.detach()
x_reconstructed = decoder(z_quantized)

loss = reconstruction_loss(x, x_reconstructed)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the forward pass, &lt;code&gt;z_quantized&lt;/code&gt; is set to the same value as before, but importantly, the gradient of &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; is now equal to that of &lt;code&gt;z_quantized&lt;/code&gt; rather than just being 0 because of the non-differentiable &lt;code&gt;to_nearest_cluster(z)&lt;/code&gt; operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a price to pay for this lie. When training, the encoder’s weights will be updated to improve the reconstruction loss, but they’re updated as if the quantization didn’t happen, so they won’t move in the optimal direction. But as long as the embeddings stick close to their cluster centers, the gradient direction will still be mostly correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can actually encourage the encoder to make embeddings that are easily quantizable by adding a commitment loss: a penalty for each point based on how far it is from its cluster center. The gradient of this loss will push the points closer to their cluster centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By quantizing at training time and adding a commitment loss, it’s no longer just a clustering being fit on top of the embeddings. The model itself is trained to be good for quantization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the training dynamics look different: the commitment loss adds a certain “stiffness” that doesn’t allow the embeddings to move around as easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what the reconstructions look like when we use the quantized representations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice how the first two images are reconstructed to exactly the same image. That’s simply because their embeddings got assigned to the same cluster and therefore quantized to the same value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model described here is known as a “VQ-VAE”: a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. The word “variational” here is just a vestigial leftover that doesn’t mean anything anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To improve the reconstruction fidelity, we can just increase the number of cluster centers. But keeping track of too many centers can get prohibitively expensive in terms of compute and memory required, so we’ll do a clever trick: if we want 2^20 (~1M) possible values, we won’t create 2^20 clusters directly. Instead, we’ll use two separate quantizers with 2^10=1024 clusters and combine their result. Each embedding will then be quantized to a tuple of two integers in [0..1023], yielding 2^20 possible combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, but how? Well, recall the &lt;code&gt;residual&lt;/code&gt; variable we used in the straight-through estimator, defined as &lt;code&gt;z - to_nearest_cluster(z)&lt;/code&gt; the shift from the quantized embedding to the unquantized one. It represents the part of the original vector &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; that we didn’t manage to take into account when quantizing to &lt;code&gt;to_nearest_cluster(z)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So for each embedding in the batch, we have a corresponding residual vector. The solution is obvious: we’ll quantize these residuals exactly the same way we did with the original embeddings, by training another vector quantizer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, the 2D positions for a single quantizer don’t define images because we need to combine the two quantizers, so we’ll just visualize everything as dots:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each image is then represented as the index of the cluster of the embedding and that of the residual. Let’s try to reconstruct a few images with this two-level quantizer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reconstructions of the first two images are similar, but no longer the exact same: the first image is represented as (4, 3) and the second as (4, 5). In other words, they share the same token for the first level, but differ in how the residual is quantized. The differences are quite subtle, so here’s a comparison between the one-level and two-level reconstructions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to emphasize that the second quantization level makes modifications to the embedding, not the output pixels directly. This can be seen by the fact that the leftmost and rightmost image are encoded as (4, 3) and (30, 3) respectively. So they have the same residual code, 3, but it modifies the two reconstructed images in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, the reconstructions are still not very accurate. The upper bound on the quality is the reconstruction from unquantized embeddings, so if your autoencoder is bad (and ours is), improving the quantization won’t save you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll stop here, but a natural extension to this idea is to go beyond two levels. Just take the residuals of the two-level reconstruction and quantize those, and so on. This generalized Residual Vector Quantization algorithm looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def rvq_quantize(z):
    residual = z
    codes = []

    for level in range(levels):
        quantized, cluster_i = to_nearest_cluster(level, residual)
        residual -= quantized
        codes.append(cluster_i)

    return codes
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Residual vector quantization was first applied to neural audio codecs in SoundStream, but the idea has been around since the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applying RVQ to audio is fairly straightforward. As our autoencoder, we’ll use a convolutional neural network (CNN) similar to what Jukebox uses. The details of the architecture aren’t too important here. What’s important is that it’s a network that takes an audio with t samples and converts it to a vector of shape (t/128, 32). In other words, it downsamples by a factor of 128 and gives us 32-dimensional float representations. The decoder then takes the (t/128, 32) embeddings and decodes them back into t samples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;audio = get_batch()               # shape: [B, T]
z = encoder(audio)                # shape: [B, T/128, 32]
audio_reconstructed = decoder(z)  # shape: [B, T]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As before, we’ll add an RVQ after the encoder. The only difference from the image case is that for each audio sample, we have t/128 embedding vectors, not just a single one as we did for images. We just quantize these independently (even though the encoder “sees” more audio than what corresponds to that one vector). During training, we also have a batch dimension, so our model now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;audio = get_batch()                         # [B, T]
z = encoder(audio)                          # [B, T/128, 32]

# Combine the batch and time dimensions
z = rearrange(                              # [B*T/128, 32]
    z, "b t_emb d -&amp;gt; (b t_emb) d"
)

codes = rvq_quantize(z)           # integers, [B*T/128, levels]
z_quantized = codes_to_embeddings(codes)    # [B*T/128, 32]
z_quantized = rearrange(                    # [B, T/128, 32]
    z, "(b t_emb) d -&amp;gt; b t_emb d"
)

audio_reconstructed = decoder(z_quantized)  # [B, T]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last missing piece before we can train our first neural audio codec is a loss function. There’s a whole rabbit hole we could go into about which one to choose, but we’ll avoid it and just use a very simple one. We’ll compute the log amplitude spectrogram of the original and reconstructed audio, and take their difference. The loss is the mean square of this difference between spectrograms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it harder for the model to overfit to this loss, we take the spectrogram with three different parameters for the short-time Fourier transform, and let our loss be the mean between the three sub-losses. This is called the multi-scale spectral loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s train some codecs! We’ll look at how varying the number of RVQ levels affects the reconstruction quality. As we expected, increasing the number of levels helps, decreasing the spectral loss:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s hear what the codecs sound like. We’ll use the three codecs to reconstruct this audio from the Expresso dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the reconstructions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, the audio gets better as we add more RVQ levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with 16 levels, there is some crackling, the audio sounds muffled, and there is a constant high-pitched noise. Later we’ll discuss how we could improve the codec further, but for demonstration purposes, this will do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now we have a neural audio codec: we can turn audio into LLM-friendly tokens and back. Codec just means a tokenizer for audio, but we say codec because that’s the term used for classic compression like MP3. I’ll be using codec and tokenizer interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s come back to what we wanted to do in the first place: modeling audio. Specifically, we’ll make a model that can take an audio prefix and generate a plausible continuation for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as a reminder, we want to train good audio LLMs so that we have models that understand and produce speech natively, understanding emotion, emphasis, and so on. They could also be fine-tuned into text-to-speech, speech-to-text, or translation models, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now that you’re convinced that audio LLMs are the path to AGI, let’s train a few.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our dataset, we’ll use Libri-Light, like we did for our sample-by-sample model earlier. This time we’ll use 10000h of audio instead of 1000h. It’s a dataset of public-domain audiobooks, so if we have a good model for it, maybe we’ll be able to generate more stories. (Don’t get your hopes up too much.) All we need to do is to convert the audio dataset into a sequence of discrete tokens so that we can feed it into an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll do that using our 8-level RVQ codec. From an audio with t samples, we’ll get an array of tokens of shape (t/128, 8). But now there’s an issue: how to deal with the fact that for each time step, there’s not one but eight tokens? This is not a problem we have to deal with in text LLMs, where we have a single sequence of tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll do the simplest thing possible and just flatten the array into 1D of shape (t/128 * 8), and have our LLM predict the eight levels in separate time steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big disadvantage is that we lose some of our temporal compression. We downsampled the audio 128x, but now we’re inflating it 8x again by flattening the levels. That makes inference less efficient, and possibly worse quality because the effective context size decreases. We'll be using the 8 RVQ codec rather than the 16 RVQ one to avoid making the compression even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could also predict all RVQ levels for a single step at once (”parallel pattern”), but it also makes things harder for the model because it has to decide on all levels at once. There are a bunch of other schemes people have tried to balance compression and quality. Here are a few tried out in MusicGen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, as of 2025, there is no single solution that “won”: every paper does something different, and the schemes can get quite involved. Just look at this diagram from MiMo-Audio, a model released in September 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to finally train a codec-wrapped language model! As I’ve mentioned, our code is based on Andrej Karpathy’s nanoGPT codebase for training text LLMs. We just need to modify it to accept audio as input. But that’s easy, because LLMs don’t care about what kind of tokens you’re feeding in – it’s all just numbers. Once we’ve tokenized the dataset and flattened it into a 1D sequence, we’re good to go. Tokenized this way, our 10000 hours of audio take up 134 GB. For comparison, storing this much data as uncompressed audio would take over 1 TB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re going to use the exact same model architecture and hyperparameters as for the sample-by-sample model: the only difference is in the tokenization. We also have a 10x bigger dataset, but the sample-by-sample model can’t even fit the dataset with 1k hours, so more data wouldn’t save it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I trained the model on 8 H100s for about 5 days. To get some samples, I decided to prompt the model with a sample of Libri-Light reading of two lines from Michael Field’s poem July. (As I learned when working on this, Michael Field is a pen name of Katherine Harris and Edith Emma Cooper.) Let’s see what kind of poetry we can get from our model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some signs of life, but we don’t have a poet yet. It sounds like somebody speaking behind a curtain. You can’t really make out what it’s saying, but the intonation is there: it sounds like somebody reading from a book, which is indeed what the model was trained on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also maintains a coherent voice, until it decides for the last few seconds to switch to a different one. That is also consistent with the data: we sample the training data from a concatenation of all the audiobooks chopped up into segments and mixed together, so the model does encounter boundaries between different speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our codec was deliberately simplistic, which explains why the results aren't great—but there's been a good amount of research on neural audio codecs in the last four years that we could leverage. We won’t implement all the improvements here, but instead we’ll look at what happens when we use Mimi as the tokenizer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mimi is a modern neural audio codec built here at Kyutai for Moshi, our audio language model. It’s since been used as the tokenizer for other models as well, like Sesame CSM, VoXtream, and LFM2-Audio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Mimi sounds a lot better than the homemade codec we trained earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of the multi-scale spectral loss, Mimi uses an adversarial loss, like a GAN. There’s a discriminator network that tries to classify audios as being original or reconstructed by the codec, and the goal of the codec is to fool this discriminator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another improvement Mimi adds is using RVQ dropout: it uses 32 RVQ levels but during training, the reconstruction is sometimes randomly truncated to a lower number of levels. That allows us to run Mimi for a lower number of RVQ levels at inference time and still get decent results, because it doesn’t rely on all levels being present. For our codec, we had to train separately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s hear our example audio reconstructed with Mimi:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our purposes, a variant with fewer levels might have the advantage of being easier to model because it’s more compressed. Let’s train models with 8- and 32-level Mimi and compare the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I trained the exact same model architecture as before, the only thing that changes is the tokenizer. It’s 10k hours from Libri-Light as the dataset, just like when we used our simple codec. Mimi has a sample rate of 24 kHz but Libri-Light uses 16 kHz, which puts a cap on how good it can sound, since we lose the higher frequencies of the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mimi downsamples the audio a lot more aggressively, too: its sample rate is 12.5 frames per second, whereas we used 125 frames per second for our codec – 10x higher! This means the dataset is also smaller on disk. With our codec, it took 134 GB, but for Mimi it’s “just” 54 GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a poem generated with the model trained on Mimi-tokenized data. I prompted it with two lines from the poem, as before:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is my best attempt at a transcription:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the grass is gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;And corn still grassy;&lt;lb/&gt;Illness worried in the fur&lt;lb/&gt;this and pelan in stones&lt;lb/&gt;during the turan’s ciscerey&lt;lb/&gt;headforths nepet Paul Twain.&lt;lb/&gt;He sees zin in them.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tad too surrealist for my taste, but maybe Lewis Carroll would like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make: I lied to you just now. But just a bit, and for didactic purposes. In fact, the model above was trained on audio from a 31-level Mimi, where I omitted the very first level, which contains the “semantic token”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The role of this token is to represent semantic information of the audio, without necessarily aiding reconstruction. I won’t go into how these work, but in one sentence, Mimi’s semantic tokens are distilled from WavLM, which you can think of as a BERT for speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get a feeling for what information semantic tokens encode, let’s take this example audio, passed through Mimi:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s train a language model trained on the full Mimi, including semantic tokens. We’re going to run the model in a way where we keep the semantic tokens from the original audio but we discard the others, and let the model predict them. That means the information from the semantic tokens is fixed (”teacher-forced”), but the model is free to decide the others according to what continuations it finds plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listen to two different reconstructions we obtain this way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The voice is completely different, but it’s saying the same thing! This means the semantic tokens encode what the person is saying, but are invariant to the voice. That’s useful because it helps the model focus on what to say, not how to say it. In that regard, they’re closer to text tokens, which also don’t contain information about the voice, intonation, timing, or emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s take the model trained on semantic Mimi and ask it to complete the poem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When grass is gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;and corn still grassy;&lt;lb/&gt;from the man was nothing moan.&lt;lb/&gt;The low death and heart&lt;lb/&gt;She came fyde wood.&lt;lb/&gt;A finteriest, a fall,&lt;lb/&gt;all them.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It still makes up words and the sentences are not too coherent, but clearly, the proportion of real words is much higher; the model is “more semantic”. The acoustic quality is the same, which is what we’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s listen to a second poem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When grass is gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;and corn still grassy;&lt;lb/&gt;hope won and she&lt;lb/&gt;who is just a night in Tatan&lt;lb/&gt;in doe ock-ohm?&lt;lb/&gt;the whom?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the whom?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can sacrifice some acoustic quality to improve the semantics by reducing the number of RVQ levels. Let’s do 8. That way, we get higher audio compression, and a proportionally higher part of the loss comes from the semantic token, since now it’s 1/8 tokens and not just 1/32.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the first things I noticed about this model is that it learned to memorize the Librivox notice, so it sometimes generates things like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 6 of The Founday, by R. Auclair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This is a Librivox recording. All Librivox recordings are in the public domain. For information, or to volunteer, please visit librivox.org.&lt;lb/&gt;Reading by: Kelvert&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeating the training data is generally not what you want, but in our case it’s a great sign of life, because the previous models couldn’t even manage that. It also makes up the book, author, and reader, so there is still novelty here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s try to make some more poetry:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When grass is gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;and corn still grassy;&lt;lb/&gt;When so we could say&lt;lb/&gt;that in fairy interesting wife&lt;lb/&gt;who lay there and gone&lt;lb/&gt;that save the rosy light of life&lt;lb/&gt;Jay Dien, the antique mollity&lt;lb/&gt;and a mollity the beast of gray failed summon&lt;p&gt;end of poem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recording is in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[different voice]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;So we have formed a float that sent in would rattle down. The piece of opportunity reading and assimila—&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great. There are several signs of the model being better than the previous ones. I love that it makes up the word “mollity” and then repeats it in the next line. Also, it realizes that it’s reciting a poem and ends the section with “end of poem”. Then it decides it’s the end of the chapter/section and it ends with the “This recording is in the public domain.” disclaimer. After that, it changes the voice and continues talking. That makes sense, since the clips from various audiobooks are just shuffled and concatenated during training, so here the model simulated a clip boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We might get even better results by weighing the loss of the semantic tokens higher than the acoustic tokens, to make the model focus more on the meaning than the sound – in fact, Moshi uses a semantic loss factor of 100x! But we have to stop somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve managed to use neural audio codecs to make an audio language model that generates somewhat coherent speech. Obviously, that’s not where the state of the art is in 2025 (and we’re not trying to reach it here) but keep in mind that by using the exact same model without neural audio codecs gives us this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, still a long way to go to match text models! Currently, there seems to be a trade-off between speech understanding and reasoning abilities. At the beginning, I mentioned that the speech-native models (Gemini, ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, Qwen, Moshi) aren’t able to tell you whether you’re speaking in a high or low voice, despite the fact that they’re trained to natively understand audio. This is likely because they’re trained on a lot of data generated synthetically with text-to-speech and/or because understanding the tone of the voice (apparently) doesn’t help the models make more accurate predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyutai took a stab at creating a voice chat based on an audio language model with Moshi (demo, paper), released in July 2024. Moshi might not be the AI you’d pick to do your homework for you, but cut it some slack: it was the first end-to-end voice AI, released even before OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moshi models an “inner monologue” text stream in parallel with audio streams for itself and the user. The text stream is helps it plan what it’s going to say, and ablations showed that the text stream helps the model massively. At the same time, it’s a bit sad: most of the reasoning seems to be delegated to the text stream and the audio streams are just there to provide an integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just Moshi: as the “am I speaking in a high voice” experiment shows, this over-reliance on text in favor of audio is an issue for all audio LLMs. And that’s even though the dominant modeling approach is somewhat different than Moshi’s: interleaving text and audio tokens instead of modeling them in parallel streams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over a year after Moshi, audio models still lag behind text LLMs. But why? To me, this mysterious unsolved “modality gap” makes audio ML an exciting field to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading! The code for the experiments is here, and for the animations here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some papers to check out if you'd like to learn more. This list is naturally Kyutai-centric because that's the school of thought I'm exposed to; my goal is not to do a complete review of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Merkle tree implementation in Rust with the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fixed depth: All proofs have a constant size equal to the &lt;code&gt;Depth&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Append-only: Leaves are added sequentially starting at index &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. Once added, a leaf cannot be modified.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized for Merkle proof retrieval: Intermediate leaves are stored so that Merkle proofs can be fetched from memory without needing to be calculated lazily, resulting in very fast retrieval times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configurable storage backends to store the bottom and intermediate leaves up the root.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configurable hash functions to hash nodes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple and easy to use interface: &lt;code&gt;add_leaves&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;num_leaves&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;proof&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;rs-merkle-tree&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency to your Rust &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[dependencies]
rs-merkle-tree = "0.1.0"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can create a Merkle tree, add leaves, get the number of leaves and get the Merkle proof of a given index as follows. This creates a simple merkle tree using keccak256 hashing algorithm, a memory storage and a depth 32.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use rs_merkle_tree::to_node;
use rs_merkle_tree::tree::MerkleTree32;

fn main() {
    let mut tree = MerkleTree32::default();
    tree.add_leaves(&amp;amp;[to_node!(
        "0x532c79f3ea0f4873946d1b14770eaa1c157255a003e73da987b858cc287b0482"
    )])
    .unwrap();

    println!("root: {:?}", tree.root().unwrap());
    println!("num leaves: {:?}", tree.num_leaves());
    println!("proof: {:?}", tree.proof(0).unwrap().proof);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can customize your tree by choosing a different store, hash function, and depth as follows. Note that you have to modify the &lt;code&gt;feature&lt;/code&gt; for the stores. This avoids importing the stuff you don't need. See the following examples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depth: 32 | Hashing: Keccak | Store: sled&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[dependencies]
rs-merkle-tree = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["sled_store"] }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use rs_merkle_tree::hasher::Keccak256Hasher;
use rs_merkle_tree::stores::SledStore;
use rs_merkle_tree::tree::MerkleTree;

fn main() {
    let mut tree: MerkleTree&amp;lt;Keccak256Hasher, SledStore, 32&amp;gt; =
        MerkleTree::new(Keccak256Hasher, SledStore::new("sled.db", true));
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depth: 32 | Hashing: Poseidon | Store: rocksdb&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;rs-merkle-tree = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["rocksdb_store"] }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use rs_merkle_tree::hasher::PoseidonHasher;
use rs_merkle_tree::stores::RocksDbStore;
use rs_merkle_tree::tree::MerkleTree;

fn main() {
    let mut tree: MerkleTree&amp;lt;PoseidonHasher, RocksDbStore, 32&amp;gt; =
        MerkleTree::new(PoseidonHasher, RocksDbStore::new("rocksdb.db"));
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depth: 32 | Hashing: Poseidon | Store: sqlite&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;rs-merkle-tree = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["sqlite_store"] }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use rs_merkle_tree::hasher::PoseidonHasher;
use rs_merkle_tree::stores::SqliteStore;
use rs_merkle_tree::tree::MerkleTree;

fn main() {
    let mut tree: MerkleTree&amp;lt;PoseidonHasher, SqliteStore, 32&amp;gt; =
        MerkleTree::new(PoseidonHasher, SqliteStore::new("tree.db"));
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following stores are supported:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following hash functions are supported:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following benchmarks measure in a AMD Ryzen 7 7700 8-Core Processor with 64GB of RAM the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consumed disk size&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Leaf insertion throughput in thousands per second.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Merkle proof generation times.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can run them with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cargo bench --features=all
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you can generate the following table with this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;python benchmarks.py
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

      &lt;p&gt; While this site doesn't provide GIF conversion at the moment, you can still do it yourself with the help of asciinema GIF generator utility - agg. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Once you have it installed, generate a GIF with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;agg https://asciinema.org/a/Lbxa2w9R5IbaJqW3INqVrbX8E demo.gif&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Or, if you already downloaded the recording file:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;agg demo.cast demo.gif&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Check &lt;code&gt;agg --help&lt;/code&gt; for all available options. You can change font
          family and size, select color theme, adjust speed and more.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;See agg manual for full usage instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the article&lt;/p&gt;here.&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, 16 October, Foreign Object Debris (FOD) struck the windshield of UA1093, a 737 MAX aircraft, at approximately 36,000 ft. WindBorne began investigating this incident on Sunday, 19 October, and we believe that the FOD was likely a WindBorne balloon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6am PT Monday morning, we sent our preliminary investigation to both the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and are working with both organizations to further investigate this incident. We are grateful that to our knowledge there were no serious injuries and no loss of pressurization. The flight, which was en route from Denver to Los Angeles, diverted to Salt Lake City. The plane itself later flew to Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WindBorne has conducted more than 4,000 launches. We have been coordinating with the FAA for the entire history of the company and file NOTAMs (aviation alerts) for every balloon we launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is designed to be safe in the event of a midair collision. This is the purpose of the FAA Part 101 and ICAO weight limits. Our balloon is 2.4 pounds at launch and gets lighter throughout flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working closely with the FAA on this matter. We immediately rolled out changes to minimize time spent between 30,000 and 40,000 feet. These changes are already live with immediate effect. Additionally, we are further accelerating our plans to use live flight data to autonomously avoid planes, even if the planes are at a non-standard altitude. We are also actively working on new hardware designs to further reduce impact force magnitude and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with matched token scale and training operations across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrary to the control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes non-trivial declines (Hedges' g&amp;gt;0.3) on reasoning, long-context understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy, narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain Of Thoughts drops 74.9 → 57.2 and RULER-CWE 84.4 → 52.3 as junk ratio rises from 0% to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Error forensics reveal several key insights:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for continual pretraining as a training-time safety problem and motivating routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Brain rot” burst into public discourse as a shorthand for how endless, low-effort, engagement-bait content can dull human cognition—eroding focus, memory discipline, and social judgment through compulsive online consumption. If large language models learn from the same internet firehose, the question becomes unavoidable: what happens when we keep feeding models the digital equivalent of junk food? Studying “Brain Rot” for LLMs isn’t just a catchy metaphor—it reframes data curation as cognitive hygiene for AI, guiding how we source, filter, and maintain training corpora so deployed systems stay sharp, reliable, and aligned over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distinct from prior work that primarily focuses on data quality for training LLMs, we aim to provide a new view on data quality - the extent to which content is trivial and easy to consume for humans in social media. The properties, conceptualized via tweet shortness/popularity or content semantics, are not intuitively related to the cognitive capabilities that we expect LLMs to master in learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intervention Method: The core idea was to simulate how an LLM's “mind” changes when fed different information diets. (1) We used continual pre-training as the main intervention — exposing models to either junk or clean data for a sustained period, just as humans continually absorb online content. (2) Afterward, every model went through the same instruction tuning step to ensure format consistency and eliminate task-specific bias.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data Receipe: To operationalize the idea of “junk,” we built two complementary metrics for selecting data from real Twitter/X posts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measuring Cognitive Function: We leverage existing benchmarks to examine the multifaceted ``cognitive functions'' of LLMs. The benchmarks cover different capabilities that were hypothesized to be affected by the junk-data intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Personality&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;TRAIT&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Psychometrically validated small human questionnaires to assess personality-like tendencies.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We analyze intervention effects by comparing benchmark differences after feeding junk/control data to four LLMs. The difference is measured by Hedges' g across 4 LLMs. In the above figure, both M1 and M2 produce non-trivial effects (Hedges' g &amp;gt; 0.3) on reasoning and long-context capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across the remaining benchmarks the two interventions diverge, implying that engagement degree (M1) is not a proxy for semantic quality (M2) but represents a distinct dimension of data quality.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;26.4&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In dose-response testing, M1 engagement intervention demonstrates more significant and progressive impacts on reasoning and long-context capabilities than M2 intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We analyze the reasoning failures in ARC-Challenge to identify different failure modes. We find that the majority failures can be attributed to "thought skipping" (e.g., the model fails to generate intermediate reasoning steps), which significantly increases in models affected by brain rot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the cognitive decline associated with brain rot is not easily mitigated by standard fine-tuning techniques. Even after extensive instruction tuning (IT) or post-doc continual pre-training on high-quality control data, the models exhibit lingering effects of the junk data they were initially exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this work, we introduced and empirically validated the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis, demonstrating that continual exposure to junk data—defined as engaging (fragmentary and popular) or semantically low-quality (sensationalist) content—induces systematic cognitive decline in large language models. The decline includes worse reasoning, poorer long-context understanding, diminished ethical norms, and emergent socially undesirable personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fine-grained analysis shows that the damage is multifaceted in changing the reasoning patterns and is persistent against large-scale post-hoc tuning. These results call for a re-examination of current data collection from the Internet and continual pre-training practices. As LLMs scale and ingest ever-larger corpora of web data, careful curation and quality control will be essential to prevent cumulative harms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Waves Of Interference&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The reason that the PC industry first landed on the FCC’s radar had little to do with the computers themselves and everything to do with the electrical noise they emitted. Blame the CB radio.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Sponsored By La Machine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tired of AI already? Meet la machine. The tech gadget invented by an AI pioneer and guaranteed 100% AI-free. Learn more here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;“Radio, television, and radar receivers are almost invariably caused to malfunction by RF interference. This is due to the very low-level circuitry contained in these devices.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— A passage from the RF Interference Control Handbook, a 1962 book by Kemp Barron that describes the reasons why radio waves can be affected by things as diverse as electrical circuits, industrial machinery, and even ignition systems. A key element of blocking such interference? Shielding—of the device, of the cabling, and of anything else that might emit waves that affect performance of radio-based products. The book is up on the Internet Archive in case you want to get the 63-year-old perspective on RF interference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How the CB radio created an interference problem for television sets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radio interference has long been a long, unusual annoyance in our society, appearing in all sorts of unusual places. Case in point: In the late 1940s, a church in Spokane, Washington found itself annoying local residents when its chime somehow kicked the radio onto the loudspeakers—ensuring the locals they might be getting some Spike Jones recordings along with their 6 a.m. bell chimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, the incident was a strange oddity—after all, we didn’t have that many radio devices in our homes. But gradually, things started to shift, and it started to become more of a problem as TV sets, ham radio operators, radar systems, and other radio-driven devices started to compete for the same finite frequencies. Hell, even noisy power lines could cause issues, as the Amateur Radio Relay League could tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was especially a pain during the early era of home electronics, as it created challenges for capturing TV channels, and high-end stereos could gain some unwanted fuzz that didn’t appear on the original album. An August 1962 edition of Popular Science had a whole feature dedicated to giving readers advice on how to get rid of ghosting, channel interference, and other issues that were common parts of the TV experience at the time. “Close observation of the symptoms on your screen is the first step,” writer Art Margolis explained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a 1961 article on RF’s impact on hi-fi stereo systems noted that the issue was both diverse and complex in nature:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Interference from radio stations, amateur radio operations, TV and X-ray generally manifests itself as a buzz, hum or high-frequency squeal. In some cases that involve broadcasting, voices come blasting through the speakers of high fidelity systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;External switching transients from appliances inside the house manifest themselves as pops when appliances are turned on or off. This type of interference can often be corrected at the source with a commercial AC line filter.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But more esoteric types of interference can’t be corrected as easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of those esoteric types turned out to be CB radio. Made available in the 1940s on a publicly accessible radio band and gradually tweaked over time, it was initially cost-prohibitive for average consumers, making it a popular option for small businesses or niche interests like boating. But the appeal of the concept was hard to ignore. As a 1960 Popular Mechanics piece put it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To get on the air on the Citizens Band, you don’t have to know a thing about radio. There are no operator’s licenses or technical examinations. All you do is buy the equipment, send for a station license (a mere formality, though a necessary one) and you’re all ready to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, that simplicity proved a double-edged sword. By the 1970s, the technology had begun to reach more consumers as the equipment dropped in price. The FCC tried to meet the demand by lowering the cost of licensing. However, the demand was gradually creating an untenable, near-unusable technology, which the success of 1975’s “Convoy” certainly did not help ease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This TV report is an absolute trip. It’s forgotten just how popular CB radio was—probably because it was the Twitter of the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People were flooding the CB’s 23 channels with constant chatter—and when the FCC expanded the number of channels to 40, radio manufacturers responded by cutting the prices of the 23-channel models, which accidentally made things even worse, as the above TV report highlights. If you were into CB radio in 1977, odds are you were in for a world of pain—with the oversaturation kind of ruining the whole thing long-term and likely facilitating the gradual shift to cellular phones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also left suffering as a result of this: TV viewers, who were seeing much more interference during this era as the CB fad overwhelmed the wireless airwaves. The FCC was dealing with tens of thousands of complaints about CB radios harming television signals, and it was becoming clear that the commission had to take these concerns seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How bad was it? Of the complaints the agency received about TV interference, a whopping 83% were caused by CB radios, according to a December 1977 Associated Press story, which noted the popularity of CB radios that Christmas would only worsen the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FCC felt that the issue was so serious that the agency created an informational guide to help manage the issue, How to Identify &amp;amp; Resolve Radio-TV Interference Problems. The booklet made clear that if a neighbor complained about your use of a CB radio, you had to take it seriously, and even described how, if necessary, you could get help from a “Local Television Interference Committee.” (While not universal, these committees tended to come from the amateur radio operator community in a given area.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that, thanks to the many, many headaches that CB radio was creating for the FCC, it only makes sense that the agency’s guard was up around other sources of RF interference. You know, like the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sucks to be a regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;“I hit the ‘run’ switch on the computer and it took off sorting the same list of numbers over and over again. At the same time my radio also took off!! The computer was sorting numbers and the radio was going ZZZIIIPP! ZZZIIPP! ZZZIIIPP!!!’”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— A passage from the article “Altair Music of a Sort,” a piece by Steven Dompier, who had figured out how to play the Beatles song “Fool on the Hill” using an Altair 8800 and a nearby radio. The reason it worked? A lack of RF shielding, meaning that the computer was actually acting as a radio transmitter. Dompier later recorded the whistling melody and played it for an audience of MIPS enthusiasts. As later recalled in a biography about Bill Gates, the reason this worked was because of a design flaw in the Altair, one the FCC would become aware of in the years to come. Curious what it sounds like? Kevin Driscoll has a recreation of the code and Dompier’s article, along with a musical performance by the Altair, on his website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When computers hit homes, the FCC’s RF interference concerns kicked into overdrive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first, computers largely appeared in businesses and universities. They hadn’t quite hit the home just yet, though electronics that had computing elements—think Pong consoles and the like—were starting to make their presence known.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That meant that these devices, like every other type of electric device (even light bulbs), could be a new source of RF interference, and as the personal computer started to gain attention and popular uptake, the industry had to adapt. Stuff like the Altair’s accidental musicianship would not fly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so too, did the Federal Communications Commission, which asked the public in 1978 to help determine a plan of action for better managing RF interference, after getting flooded with complaints for years on end. An inquiry document implied that the FCC was considering its options for about regulating this technology. The organization implied that it may not be cost-effective or even necessary, and even floated a voluntary approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Greater immunity will require more sophisticated design, additional components, and increased testing, all of which will increase equipment production cost. The magnitude of this increase will depend upon the immunity standards prescribed,” the commission wrote, adding that the public may still choose the cheaper, unshielded option if given the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After spending time digging in, however, it’s clear the agency decided that they needed to take a harder line than the voluntary one posed. After all, computers were taking over the household, and so too were VCRs, video games, walkie-talkies, and all matter of electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the computer industry was still very immature at this time, with devices like the Commodore PET, TRS-80, and Apple II still quite new, each representing early attempts at bringing personal computers to a large home market. We were a step beyond the pure hobbyist nerdery of the Altair but far from maturity. The FCC wanted to head off issues with these new devices before things went too far—and saw the dynamic around consumer devices as being distinctly different from commercial platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By September 1979, the FCC was ready to weigh in, and it was worried about your neighbor’s TV experience above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are most interested in protecting an individual who is receiving interference from his neighbor’s computer. To a lesser extent, we are concerned about devices in the same household,” the agency wrote in its rulemaking document, FCC 79-555. (The goal? To prevent interference so bad that it harmed the experience for someone in a completely different home.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The document, which applied Part 15 regulations to computers for the first time, made clear that CB radio played a decisive factor in the final result. (Especially given the timing, which came mere months after the FCC highlighted the sheer scale of complaints it received.) The commission learned a lot from its more laissez-faire approach, which ultimately damaged the consumer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Unless the Commission acts expediously to head off the problem, we may be faced with an intolerable interference problem similar to CB interference problems of several years ago,” the commission continued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was not good news for all these technology startups in the budding computer industry. Suddenly, companies large and small had to share their new products—and presumably, their trade secrets—with the FCC in an attempt to ensure that the electronics were safe to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This created major headaches, especially for companies that already had products on the market, which now had to stop producing RF interference on TV and radio frequencies altogether. As the magazine Kilobaud put it in 1981: “After three years of study, the FCC handed the microcomputer industry a mandate: Get rid of the RFI by January 1981, or close up shop.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These standards meant additional testing—including the use of a spectrum analyzer and a dedicated testing site to ensure that equipment meets respectable radiation standards. And these standards could be quite confusing for manufacturers, even affecting things like upgradeability. Per Kilobaud’s Chris Brown and Eric Maloney, “As far as the FCC is concerned, an 8K CPU that has the potential of being upgraded to 16K is actually two different computers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put simply, this put a huge testing onus on manufacturers, likely raising prices in the short term and leading to additional metal shielding as a band-aid to retrofit existing designs to fit the FCC’s regulations. Large manufacturers likely were already doing a lot of this on their own. The problem was that this put a lot of additional pressure on the makeshift startups that made the sector viable in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manufacturers had to adapt. For example, Apple released newer iterations of the Apple II, such as the Apple II Plus and Apple IIe, to help improve the electromagnetic noise that the original created. (Which means, if you want a computer with no RF shielding because you desire to make music via radio interference, get the original Apple II.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple had to take this stuff seriously, because the FCC was paying special attention to them. The company was specifically cited in the commission’s rulemaking as being aware of the problem as far back as 1976. And it got nailed at least once for noncompliance: On top of all the other challenges that the ill-fated Apple III faced, the machine had to be recalled and replaced with a new model because its RF shielding wasn’t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ironically, the rules were way less strict for computers in office or industrial environments, which received a Class A regulation, than for consumer tech, which required the stricter Class B designation. After all, if the goal is to prevent radio interference, your Facts of Life-watching neighbor is going to have bigger issues than your spreadsheet-embracing co-worker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this was a pain to manage, but you’ll be surprised to learn that, in the end, all this added regulation probably ended up making the computer industry better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;“In waiving Part 15, Subpart D, the commission noted that this individual cow identification system would be in the public interest by increasing the efficiency of dairy herd management and thereby lowering the costs of dairy products.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— A statement from the Federal Communications Commission, describing one example of the organization making an exception for the Part 15 rules—for, of all things, a cow-tracking transmitter system called BouMatic. (The goal: To determine when cows were ready for breeding.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want an explanation of how RF interference regulations improved the computer industry, I point to the device you’re probably reading this on—a phone or a laptop. Each show the amount of engineering work required to build something that is less noisy from an RF standpoint, while still working in tighter contours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve opened up a MacBook Pro recently, you’ve probably noticed that there aren’t tons of seemingly extraneous metal shields everywhere. That is a sign of the incremental work done to cut down on interference—the shielding is still in there, but it’s shielded from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(By the way, it’s worth noting that some of the earliest successful players in the laptop space, like Toshiba, had to additionally navigate strict Japanese electronics regulations, such as the VCCI Council, which played a similar role to that of the FCC. That additional layer of regulation probably gave them an upper hand in the early years of portable computing.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or I could point to the fact that you’re probably not reading this on a wired connection, and are likely taking advantage of Wi-Fi. The PC industry likely would not have figured out how to share waves of data over antennas had it not been forced to get its house in order first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, sure, the FCC testing causes problems—the reason the iPhone was announced six months before it went on sale was because the commission would have otherwise blown up Apple’s spot—but on balance, it has ultimately made our gadgets better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things have improved to the point that when significant incidents of RF interference happen, they make the news, just like they did in the 1940s. Back in 2019, the city of North Olmsted, Ohio faced a bizarre issue where garage door openers and key fobs stopped working correctly, and for days, the community could not figure out why. Even shutting off the power on an entire city block couldn’t solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, after a lot of looking by city officials, they found the cause: A homemade gadget in a tinkerer’s home that turned off a light whenever someone was working upstairs. The device just happened to use the same frequency as many garage door openers, and it was powered by battery, so it wasn’t even on the damn grid! It’s the perfect example of why the FCC’s testing actually makes a ton of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We live in a world where you can use a laptop in the passenger seat of a car, and it probably won’t cause the radio in the car next to you to turn into a static mess. I don’t know anyone who uses a CB radio in 2025, but I’m betting the laptop wouldn’t mess with it, either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
