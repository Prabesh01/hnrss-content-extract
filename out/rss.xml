  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Managing context on the Claude Developer Platform&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing new capabilities for managing your agents’ context on the Claude Developer Platform: context editing and the memory tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our latest model, Claude Sonnet 4.5, these capabilities enable developers to build AI agents capable of handling long-running tasks at higher performance and without hitting context limits or losing critical information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Context windows have limits, but real work doesn’t&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As production agents handle more complex tasks and generate more tool results, they often exhaust their effective context windows—leaving developers stuck choosing between cutting agent transcripts or degrading performance. Context management solves this in two ways, helping developers ensure only relevant data stays in context and valuable insights get preserved across sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Context editing automatically clears stale tool calls and results from within the context window when approaching token limits. As your agent executes tasks and accumulates tool results, context editing removes stale content while preserving the conversation flow, effectively extending how long agents can run without manual intervention. This also increases the effective model performance as Claude focuses only on relevant context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memory tool enables Claude to store and consult information outside the context window through a file-based system. Claude can create, read, update, and delete files in a dedicated memory directory stored in your infrastructure that persists across conversations. This allows agents to build up knowledge bases over time, maintain project state across sessions, and reference previous learnings without having to keep everything in context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memory tool operates entirely client-side through tool calls. Developers manage the storage backend, giving them complete control over where the data is stored and how it’s persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 enhances both capabilities with built-in context awareness—tracking available tokens throughout conversations to manage context more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these updates create a system that improves agent performance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable longer conversations by automatically removing stale tool results from context&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boost accuracy by saving critical information to memory—and bring that learning across successive agentic sessions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building long-running agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best model in the world for building agents. These features unlock new possibilities for long-running agents—processing entire codebases, analyzing hundreds of documents, or maintaining extensive tool interaction histories. Context management builds on this foundation, ensuring agents can leverage this expanded capacity efficiently while still handling workflows that extend beyond any fixed limit. Use cases include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coding: Context editing clears old file reads and test results while memory preserves debugging insights and architectural decisions, enabling agents to work on large codebases without losing progress.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Research: Memory stores key findings while context editing removes old search results, building knowledge bases that improve performance over time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data processing: Agents store intermediate results in memory while context editing clears raw data, handling workflows that would otherwise exceed token limits.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Performance improvements with context management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On an internal evaluation set for agentic search, we tested how context management improves agent performance on complex, multi-step tasks. The results demonstrate significant gains: combining the memory tool with context editing improved performance by 39% over baseline. Context editing alone delivered a 29% improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a 100-turn web search evaluation, context editing enabled agents to complete workflows that would otherwise fail due to context exhaustion—while reducing token consumption by 84%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These capabilities are available today in public beta on the Claude Developer Platform, natively and in Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. Explore the documentation for context editing and the memory tool, or visit our cookbook to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;People are starting to realize that this 'digital reputation' could limit their opportunities.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;(And that these algorithms are often biased, and built on bad data.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;In the news&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;You may not get that dream job if your data suggests you're not a very positive person.&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;If you are a woman you may see fewer ads for high paying jobs.&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;If you have "bad friends" on social media you might pay more for your loan.&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tinder's algorithms might not show you attractive people if you are not desirable yourself.&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cambridge Analytica created psychological profiles on all Americans to try and dissuade people from voting.&lt;/head&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;If you return goods to the store often this will be used against you.&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What you post on social media may influence your odds of getting a tax audit.&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Your health insurer may collect intimate data about your lifestyle, race and more.&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;People are changing their behavior to get better scores.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This has good and bad sides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Social Cooling is a name for the long-term negative side effects of living in a reputation economy:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. A culture of conformity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you ever hesitated to click on a link because you thought your visit might be logged, and it could look bad?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More and more people feel this pressure, and they are starting to apply self-censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. A culture of risk-aversion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When doctors in New York were given scores this had unexpected results.&lt;lb/&gt; Doctors that tried to help advanced cancer patients had a higher mortality rate, which translated into a lower score.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doctors that didn't try to help were rewarded with high scores, even though their patients died prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rating systems can create unwanted incentives, and increase pressure to conform to a bureaucratic average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Increased social rigidity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digital reputation systems are limiting our ability and our will to protest injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In China each adult citizen is getting a government mandated "social credit score". This represents how well behaved they are, and is based on crime records, what they say on social media, what they buy, and even the scores of their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have a low score you can't get a government job, visa, cheap loan, or even a nice online date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social pressure is the most powerful and most subtle form of control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; As our weaknesses are mapped..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;We are becoming too transparent.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;This is breeding a society where self-censorship and risk-aversion are the new normal.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Yes, we've had credit ratings before. But this is a whole new scale, with an incredible level of automation, integration and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;We should compare this problem to Global Warming.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Social Cooling is subtle&lt;/head&gt;The pollution of our social environment is invisible to most people, just like air pollution was at first.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Social Cooling is complex&lt;/head&gt;It cannot be solved by politicians, citizens, entrepreneurs or scientists on their own.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Public awareness is still very low.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took 40 years to get the problems with oil on the agenda, and 80 years to get to where we are now.&lt;lb/&gt; We can't take that long with Social Cooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In the next 10 years we will need to spread a more mature and nuanced perception of data and privacy.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;As pressure to be perfect rises we will learn what privacy really is:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Can we still forgive and forget?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When algorithms judge everything we do, we need to protect the right to make mistakes.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; When everything is remembered as big data, we need the right to have our mistakes forgotten.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our data driven world..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Help spread the word&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are privacy-friendly sharing buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 5 months ago I made the decision to start self hosting my own S3. I was working on AppGoblin’s SDK tracking of the top 100k Android and iOS apps so was wanting a lot of space, but for cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;I got really lucky with getting a second hand Framework laptop. The laptop was missing it’s screen, and was one of the older ones, so it was perfect for a home server. In addition I bought a “just a bunch of disks” JBOD. The framework laptop is running ZFS + garage S3. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I’m happy to report I haven’t thought about this laptop for months&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been away, I’ve been working, I’ve been busy, and I’ve definitely been using my S3. But I hadn’t thought about the laptop in 4 months. When I finally logged in, I saw I’ve used 10TB of space and it was patiently waiting for a restart for some upgrades. I nervously restarted, and was so relieved to see everything come right back up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I updated garage s3 with no issues as well&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also saw a pending upgrade for garage v1 to v2. This went along without a hitch too. Feels like it’s been a good weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I’ve been warned…&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just so you know, I understand my use case for ZFS is possibly a bit non standard as I’m using a USB to connect the laptop and JBOD. This initially caused me issues with ZFS when garage was heavily reading and writing (the initial setup had the SQLite metadata also stored on the JBOD/ZFS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I moved my metadata to the laptop, which has so far resolved any ZFS issues again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gordon Bell and Dan Dodge were finishing their time at the University of Waterloo in Ontario in 1979. In pursuit of their masters degrees, they’d worked on a system called Thoth in their real-time operating systems course. Thoth was interesting not only for having been real-time and having featured synchronous message passing, but also for originally having been written in the B programming langue. It was then rewritten in the UW-native Eh language (fitting for a Canadian university), and then finally rewritten in Zed. It is this last, Zed-written, version of Thoth to which Bell and Dodge would have been exposed. Having always been written in a high-level language, the system was portable, and programs were the same regardless of the underlying hardware. Both by convention and by design, Thoth strongly encouraged programs to be structured as networks of communicating processes. As the final project for the RTOS course, students were expected to implement a real-time system of their own. This experience was likely pivotal to their next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The duo’s first year after graduation was a busy one. They moved to Kanata, went to work for Bell-Northern Research (now Nortel), and on the 30th of March in 1980, they founded Quantum Software Systems. To continue their research and experimentation with operating systems, they assembled a microcomputer built around a Motorola 6809. With the release of the IBM PC in September of 1981, Quantum’s efforts shifted to that target. Their goal was to produce a real-time operating system that would enable the PC’s use in factories, communication systems, and anywhere else that emphasized reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first version of Bell and Dodge’s operating system was QUNIX 0.1 (the Q could have been for Quantum, or for Quick, I’ve seen both from former Quantum employees), and it was running on that early, hand-assembled, 8bit microcomputer. This earliest creation was never released outside of Quantum Software as far as I know. QUNIX was a vaguely UNIX-like, microkernel, real-time operating system. I say that it was vaguely UNIX-like because in these early versions, there were some serious differences. In QUNIX, there were CP/M-like things too. Each disk had a drive number prefix, non-disk device files’ names were reserved, and the commands were a bit different from those in UNIX, often simplified to the point of being more CP/M-like than UNIX-like. Another major difference was the directory hierarchy. On a traditional UNIX system, binaries were stored in &lt;code&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;, configurations in &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt;, and user directories in &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt;. On QUNIX, this wasn’t the case. Commands included in the path variable were in &lt;code&gt;/cmds&lt;/code&gt;, configuration files were in &lt;code&gt;/config&lt;/code&gt;, the OS binaries were in &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt;, user directories were &lt;code&gt;/user&lt;/code&gt;, drivers were in &lt;code&gt;/drivers&lt;/code&gt;, and utilities were in &lt;code&gt;/util&lt;/code&gt;. Then, the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; command did not exist, and &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; was used instead. Instead of &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt;, the system had &lt;code&gt;task&lt;/code&gt; with the labels of father, son, and brother to denote parent and child processes. The first version of QUNIX for the IBM PC was made before the end of 1981, and released either in December of 1981 or January of 1982, making QUNIX the first known microkernel operating system for the PC platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fun note from Paul N. Leroux, the bar chart on the monitor in the back left was physically glued to that monitor for another press image. It wasn’t meant to be in this image, but as photo editing tools were essentially non-existent at the time, fixing this would have required them to reshoot. They chose to go to press with bar chart present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With QUNIX 0.4.33 in 1982, QUNIX became the first operating system for the IBM PC to support a hard disk, and in particular, it supported a 5MB Davong HDD. Given that a 10MB disk in 1982 could cost around $3000, it makes sense that the company’s first target was a bit more modest. At this point, however, QUNIX would not boot from an HDD. All of the floppy contents could be copied to a hard disk, but the user would still need to boot from a floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in these early stages of development, the system began getting recognition, and this became a small problem. The name QUNIX was a bit too close to the name UNIX for AT&amp;amp;T. The name of the system was changed to QNX in late 1982 following a Cease and Desist by AT&amp;amp;T. The first official QNX version was released the following year. At the time of the name change the kernel consisted of around 10K line of C, and it handled task scheduling, message passing, and task priority. Everything else was implemented in services that used the microkernel’s message passing to communicate with each other (even drivers, filesystems, and networking). As an important feature, message queues were network transparent so a task on one physical machine could communicate with a task on a separate physical machine on the same network as easily as if it were local. This inherently multitasked and multiuser system allowed 250 simultaneous tasks from 4 to 16 simultaneous users. The system would make extensive use of the 8087 if it was available, and required a minimum of 96K RAM. Loading up the C compiler would require an additional 32K. It’s impressive what the small company achieved on the 8088, even if, for the time, the RAM requirements were quite high. QNX release version 1.0, in March of 1983, running on an IBM PC achieved 29% to 47% the speed of a DEC VAX 11/780 depending upon the task at hand when tested by Rao Mikkilineni at Bell Labs. Sadly, I’ve been unable to find his original write-up of his testing, which was apparently in the publication Personna. If you have information about it, I’d love to get some details. While RV1 was limited to just C and x86 assembly language, the company was hard at work on BASIC, FORTRAN, and Pascal compilers that would utilize common code generators allowing for the mixed-use of languages without losing optimization. With the introduction of GUIs on the Apple Lisa, Xerox systems, and VisiCorp’s Visi-On, Quantum also had plans for windowing as well. According to Quantum’s president Syd Geraghty in InfoWorld on the 21st of March in 1983, the majority of customers were high-end system developers at large corporations. Version 1.0 cost $650 in 1983 (around $2100 in 2025), and that included a C compiler, full-screen editor, the ability to read MS-DOS disks, and full networking support. I haven’t found much information about versions 1.1 through 1.14, but I did find some information about 1.20 released on the 15th of November in 1984. This version brought pattern matching on filenames in the current directory, expanded shell programming, &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; was now a separate task with fast user switching and login stacking, &lt;code&gt;TCAP&lt;/code&gt; (think terminfo), &lt;code&gt;ed&lt;/code&gt; was rewritten and supported full-screen visual mode (think Vi), and support for the IBM AT (real-mode) was added. The price of QNX had also fallen to $450.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June of 1981, the Ontario Ministry of Education identified computing as being important for the future, and they wanted to bring computing into their schools. They were also quite aware that some teachers had taken the initiative to bring microcomputers into their classrooms already, and the Commodore PET was the most common for programming courses, while the Apple II was the most common for other educational programs. Targeting many computers would have meant that they’d have rather high software development costs in any attempt to achieve standardization, and it was therefore decided that they’d need a single computer. In 1983, it was found by the ministry and the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance that no existing computer would fully satisfy the goals of their educational computer. By March that year, some requirements had been drafted: all-in-one PET-like design, headphone output for voice and sound, a trackball, an 80186 CPU, a multitasking operating system, color graphics, voice synthesis, keyboard with accented characters, and networked storage (no physical disk in the computer itself). This machine as described had the sobriquet “bionic beaver.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the specifications in hand, Robert Arn at CATA created CEMCORP (Canadian Educational Microprocessor Corporation) and won a contract from the ministry for $10 million to develop the initial machines. This resulted in the ICON having been chosen. This machine was initially manufactured by Microtel and it ran QNX from Quantum Software Systems. The first machines were delivered in 1984. Later machines were produced, sold, and supported by Burroughs Canada, and after the merger with Sperry in 1986, by Unisys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ICON was built around an Intel 80186 clocked at 7.16MHz and 512K RAM. It lacked any local storage having neither a hard disk drive nor floppy disk drive. At boot, the computer grabbed QNX from a local LexICON file server over a 2.5Mbps ARCNET connection, and loaded the OS into RAM. Once loaded, the user logged into the system and his/her home directory was on the file server. Up to 32 of these machines could be on a single LAN. Saving any work to a floppy, meant putting the floppy into the file server, and then copying the file from the LexICON hard disk (early models were 10MB, later models were 64MB) to that floppy. The cost of these machines was high at $2500, but any school need only have paid $495 with the government covering the rest. One incredibly forward thinking feature was the lessonware. This would have been a hypertext system in which educators could have written pages that linked to others building an extensive corpus overtime. Even applications could have been run by simply clicking a link. This model was rejected by the ministry before the ICON shipped, and was replaced by a top-down system with ministry making lesson decisions. This also resulted in the ICON having shipped a QNX CLI with the CEMCORP text editor in the earliest models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ICON was a project hated by many and loved by many. For detractors, it was seen as expensive and wasteful while not exposing students to industry currents. For supporters, it accomplished all of its goals. It was excellent for programming, and it was excellent at multitasking, networking, and running educational software. The software was also quite reliable. It was QNX doing what QNX does best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From students who used ICONs, we know that it did have educational games, text editors, compilers, word processors, spread sheets, circuit design and simulation software, and CAD software. Of course, being networked machines, some unconventional students figured out ways to hack into other machines over the network, print stuff to other students’ screens, and generally cause some chaos. Combined with audio capabilities (later models even included MIDI support), this apparently got a bit out of hand from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I normally wouldn’t show so many ads, but here is a development that is rather interesting. OS/2 had been announced on the 2nd of April in 1987, and Quantum perceived the OS as a real threat. The comparisons to UNIX were now joined by comparisons to OS/2, and QNX wanted to be certain that people understood QNX to be superior. This advertisement also shows us that QNX had responded to OS/2’s ability to run DOS software by adding that feature to QNX with the QDOS II (invoked as &lt;code&gt;QDOS&lt;/code&gt;) emulator, or by running a DOS application as a task via &lt;code&gt;RUNDOS&lt;/code&gt;. QNX had been ported to the IBM PS/2 as well. This was QNX version 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the release of QNX version 2 was announced on the release date of version 1.2. The release of this version appears to have been quite late, and it occurred in autumn of 1987 (two years after the initial release date given). This release brought protected-mode support for the IBM AT, full LAN support with some networking enhancements ported from BSD, support for files of up to one terabyte in size, up to 32 serial ports in one machine, and a somewhat primitive GUI called House about which I can find nothing but the name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I couldn’t find anything about the House graphical environment, QNX Windows running the Open Look Window Manager (OLWM) is available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June of 1987, Quantum Software Systems ceased renting their office space, and they moved into a building they’d had built just for them. Following this, the company would expand the building three times, and finally add another building. So, the company moved from 215 Stafford Road to 175 Terrance Mathews Crescent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As late as 1990, QNX advertisements still mentioned performance on the 80286. This seems more as though Quantum didn’t spend much on marketing rather than not having progressed. In Dan Hildebrand’s An Architectural Overview of QNX from April of 1992, we find that the company had developed QNX versions up to 3.15, and articles about operating systems in the tech press had mentioned QNX as one of the systems that took advantage of features in the 80386.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1989, Quantum Software Systems began work on a dramatic overhaul of the operating system. This new version would be fully POSIX-compliant and increase performance over the prior generation of QNX operating systems. This version, 4.0, was released in 1991. The kernel now had just 14 calls associated with IPC, network, scheduling, and interrupts, and the kernel weighed in at just 7K (605 LOC), allowing the entire kernel to fit in CPU caches of the time. Unlike earlier versions, messages were no longer queued. Instead, they were copied from process to process. Being POSIX-compliant allowed for the easier porting of software, and it also meant that the directory hierarchy was decidedly more familiar to UNIX veterans. Beyond source compatibility, Quantum was actively working on becoming binary compatible with UNIX as of 1992. In 1994, beyond POSIX and performance, QNX 4.1 introduced the QNX Photon microGUI. This system was developed by Patrick Hayden and Robin Burgener. Much like the underlying system, it was built around a microkernel (around 20K), and it was network transparent. A Photon application could have its interface beamed to another QNX 4 machine at any point in time, or it could be dragged from one device to another just as easily. Photon likewise allowed remote monitoring or control of the user interface. This worked regardless of the device class (desktop, laptop, handheld, server). For those who needed it, the X Windows System (X11R5, Motif Window Manager) was also available, though Photon did implement a binary interface library that was X compatible. Being so lightweight allowed the company to release a demo disk that combined networking, a web browser, web server, graphical environment, file manager, text editor, a vector animation demo, and Towers of Hanoi game onto a single 1.44MB floppy. Unlike prior QNX versions, version 4 required at least an Intel 80386 and VGA graphics card. No 16bit systems were supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;KANATA, ONTARIO, September, 1994—QNX Software Systems Ltd., developers of the QNX realtime operating system, announced a unique window system targeted for handheld and embedded applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;According to Rob Oakley, Corporate Communications and Product Management, "the Photon Window System is the first of its kind—a GUI built around a graphical microkernel."&lt;lb/&gt;QNX Software Systems designed the Photon Window System as a graphical microkernel and a team of cooperating processes, basing this design on the company's QNX OS, a microkernel network-distributed system.&lt;lb/&gt;Photon's cooperating processes provide the functionality to scale the system up into a full-featured windowing system or down to fit into resource-constrained environments, like handheld personal computers (HPCs) and compact embedded systems.&lt;lb/&gt;Photon provides a rich widget library that operates much like the X Window System widget set, with an X-inspired API. A Motif-like window manager and a code-generating, visual application builder are also available.&lt;lb/&gt;"Photon is extremely light and fast. It runs in only 256K, yet provides enormous GUI functionality," Oakley said.&lt;lb/&gt;Like the QNX OS itself, Photon is network transparent—an HPC running Photon and QNX, equipped with a wireless LAN interface, becomes a transparent extension of the LAN, able to use all the LAN's resources as if they were integrated directly into the HPC. The power this brings to the HPC user is difficult to appreciate—imagine having the power of 100 Pentiums in the palm of your hand!&lt;lb/&gt;According to Dan Dodge, Vice President R&amp;amp;D, "Photon applications are very network distributed. From the application's perspective, all the resources of all the nodes on the LAN look like a single, logical machine. The environment is so transparent that a user can drag applications from one physical screen to another."&lt;lb/&gt;For example, a user in a factory control environment could walk up to a computer and drag an application from the control screen onto an HPC, and then walk out onto the factory floor with it and interact with the live application.&lt;lb/&gt;Although Photon is aimed at compact environments, its dynamic range is extensive. "Photon's API and rich widget library can support high-performance GUI applications with enough functionality to enter the domain of X, while consuming only a fraction of the resources," said Dodge.&lt;lb/&gt;The QNX operating system is a POSIX-certified realtime OS for Intel and AMD processors. Scalable and modular, QNX fits a wide range of environments, from compact embedded controllers to resource-rich X-based development systems, to distributed realtime systems running hundreds of CPUs.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Versions 4.2, 4.22, and 4.24 all released in 1995. The final version 4 release was 4.25 in 1997. At least one QNX 4 installation ran for over 20 years without a reboot at the ESA. This was possible because peripherals could be hotswapped, drivers could be changed, and network nodes could be added or removed without bringing the system down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, we see that in 1994, Quantum renamed itself to QNX Software Systems Limited. And with a new name and a new version of their operating system, the company won some major installs. From POS systems at FasFax that allowed for real-time sales figures from geographically disparate locations, to video conferencing systems at Georgia State University, to factories, power plants, hospitals, set-top boxes, phone systems, trains, jets, the Space Shuttle, ISPs, and even traffic lights. The price for a single license dropped to around $285 at this time, and by 1995, QNX was the leading real-time OS for x86 systems. The majority of the company’s revenue was from large enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, change was coming in the 1990s, and QSSL knew it. The company took the QNX kernel from version 4.24 and forked it. They had multiple goals with this fork. The system needed to be SMP capable, support POSIX, and be more portable to new hardware. The kernel handled only IPC, message passing, interrupts, and timing. Threading became the minimal unit of scheduling. The new Process Manager then used a loader thread that copied a process’s image into memory freeing the Manager to service other requests while a program continued to load. Naturally, being a real-time system, priority levels were used when scheduling any time-critical process, and new processes inherited the priority of their parent by default. The Process Manager weighed in at 32K (same size as the kernel itself) but added memory allocation, process contexts, resource-manager namespaces, and so on. In this new QNX version, the Process Manager ran inside the microkernel’s address space, but was the only element of the OS to do so. Much of the network stack for this version came from NetBSD, and with that came the ability to use NetBSD network drivers. There was another major change that came from the wider UNIX world, GCC. This naturally meant that language support was quite broadened to include not just C, C++ but all of the other languages supported by the GNU Compiler Collection. This became QNX Neutrino 1.0 released in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 19th of October in 1998, QSSL announced QNX Neutrino 2.0 which featured UPM (Universal Process Model). In the words of CTO Dan Dodge:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The premise of UPM is simple. Go beyond the limited MMU protection provided by the other major embedded OSs - where only applications are prevented from corrupting memory - and extend that protection down to services at the kernel level. The result? For the first time, MIPS and PowerPC-based embedded systems can intelligently recover from software faults in drivers, protocol stacks, and custom OS extensions - typically without rebooting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QNX was branching into non x86 platforms, and this included PowerPC processors: 401, 403GC, 603e, 821, 823, 860; MIPS processors R4000 and R5000; and naturally all x86 CPUs from the 80386 onward. At this stage, however, the development environment was restricted to QNX 4 and Windows 95/98/NT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This announcement was followed by another about a partnership with Amiga:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cologne, Germany, November 13 - Amiga Inc. today announced a partnership with QNX Software Systems Ltd. to utilize the QNX realtime operating system (RTOS) as the foundation for the next-generation Amiga architecture. The announcement was made at Computer '98 in Cologne.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"The Amiga shook the industry in the 80s with world-leading multimedia architecture," said Jeff Schindler, general manager of Amiga Inc. "QNX's RTOS resembles many of Amiga's unique qualities. It provides the foundation in reaching our vision for the rebirth of Amiga in the new millenium."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"We see this partnership as a powerful combination of superior OS technologies, common corporate cultures, and shared business vision," said Dan Dodge, Chief Technology Officer and Cofounder of QNX Software Systems Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;About Amiga&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Amiga Inc. is a technology company targeting the next generation of Amiga architecture with a continued focus on multimedia and the Internet. Since the introduction of the Amiga A1000 in 1985, Amiga has represented the embodiment of the efficient use of memory and hard drive capacity, while pioneering industry developments in multimedia, 32-bit multitasking, and autoconfiguration. Amiga led the industry in combining computer graphics, animation, and film sequences with stereo sound known today as multimedia. Visit http://www.amiga.com and http://www.amiga.de.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;About QSSL&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Founded in 1980, QNX Software Systems is one of the top three realtime operating-system vendors in the world, with products licensed in more than a million systems worldwide. The company has established a strong customer base in a variety of industries, including aerospace, telecommunications, medical instrumentation, process control, point-of-sale, consumer electronics, finance, and telephony. With products distributed in over 100 countries, the company is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Amiga port should have been somewhat straightforward considering that Amiga accelerators had been using PowerPC chips, and those chips were now supported by QNX. Gateway’s Amiga team was working closely with QSSL to build a new Amiga (Amiga NG) around the PowerPC G3 and G4 chips running QNX, and these were apparently prototyped as single, dual, and quad processor machines. During alpha testing, Gateway PowerPC boards apparently had some issues, and the two parties blamed one another. By the middle of 1999, Gateway, QSSL, and to some extent Motorola, had poured a hefty sum into the project, and Gateway began insisting on a solid date for the availability of a QNX Neutrino port. Evidently they weren’t satisfied, and I do not believe communication between the two teams, which had one been quite good, was solid by this point. At noon on the 8th of July in 1999, Dan Dodge announced the QNX Developers Network for Amigans. This was followed by another announcement at 15:15 the following day:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Eight months ago we were chosen by Amiga as their foundation OS partner. Our development group was thrilled to be part of the rebirth of such an innovative product. To meet the challenge we knew it would take a tremendous effort on our part. We had a team of people in place working on our part of the Amiga NG soon after the alliance was announced. Over the next few months we involved more and more of our engineering resouces towards making QNX an advanced multi-media platform. Our investment so far has been significant. These are costs we have borne ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is clear today from Jim's letter that we were not chosen for the next generation Amiga. Naturally we're disappointed. So, where do we stand now? It is not our intent to confuse the Amiga community. We are proud of what we have accomplished and want to include Amigans in what we've achieved. I did make a promise to deliver an operating system and I intend on keeping that promise. I don't want to split the community, nor do I wish to engage in a war of words. I don't ask you to "trust" me or to take me at my word. Both QNX and Amiga have promised to deliver technology into your hands in the very near future. I ask only that your assessment of QNX be based on what we do and what we deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thanks for the overwhelming support we have received so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That letter by Jim Collas read, in part:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amigans,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of research and in-depth discussions with all of our technology partners we have decided to use Linux as the primary OS kernel for the new Amiga Operating Environment (OE). I know this decision is a shock to many of you given the previous announcements and activities relative to QNX. This was a very complicated and difficult decision to make and I assure you that I didn't make this decision without a significant amount of research and deliberation. We have been researching Linux since February but didn't finalized our decision until several weeks ago. We were planning to communicate it to the Amiga community in the technology brief that will be released in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pressed to communicate the Linux decision before the technology brief because of information released by QNX in the last few days. This information had not been reviewed or approved for release by Amiga. In light of our Linux decision, this information is confusing and misleading so I would like to take the time to clarify the situation. I can't disclose any details of the Amiga/QNX discussions because of legally binding confidentiality agreements but I can talk to you about our decision to use the Linux kernel. I think that you will agree that this is the right decision once you understand the reasons for this decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I continue, I should mention that our technology decision does not reflect negatively on QNX. I believe that QNX is a good company with great technology. I just believe that Linux gives us a better chance of executing our plans successfully. The decision to use QNX as our OS partner on our next generation multimedia convergence computer (MCC) was made late last year. When I took over as president of Amiga in February of this year, I initiated an in-depth review of existing Amiga plans and decisions. As president of Amiga I had to make sure that we were defining a strategy and an execution plan that would allow Amiga and the Amiga community to be successful. We reviewed our strategy, architecture decisions, technology partners, and execution plans. During this review period we also added a number of very talented and experienced people to help us finalize our technology and product decisions. I am confident that we now have a solid and exciting plan that people can have confidence in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux has been picking up substantial momentum over the past year as a viable, open OS alternative in the marketplace. This momentum, the growing commitment to Linux applications from a wide variety of software vendors, and the growing availability of Linux device drivers from hardware vendors, makes it a compelling candidate. Additionally, with all of the significant component suppliers putting resources on writing drivers for Linux it was difficult to get them to port to yet another operating system. Using the Linux OS as a foundation for our Amiga OE allows us to leverage a significant amount of available software drivers and utilities. This allows us to quickly support multiple graphics cards and other peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the above-mentioned advantages, we decided to do an in-depth technical analysis of Linux to determine if it was a suitable OS kernel for our new Amiga operating environment (OE). As we ported parts of our higher level operating environment and AmigaObject architecture to Linux, we discovered some significant performance advantages in the Linux kernel in areas such as distributed object messaging across a network (up to 10X the performance of Windows NT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that the next generation Amiga will not be unique? Absolutely not! Remember that the OS kernel is only one component of the new Amiga OE and the hardware is unique. The revolutionary nature of the Amiga OE is in the way it extends the traditional operating system to provide a host environment for a new class of portable applications - applications that exist in a pervasive networked computing environment. We will be integrating multiple technologies including an efficient windowing environment and a unique user interface. In summary, we decided to use Linux because of the incredible momentum and the fact that it is solid technology and a good foundation for our new Amiga OE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Linux community is an impressive force that we should be aligned with. We share many common values and objectives with the Linux community. Using Linux as our OS kernel allows us to build a unique and revolutionary operating environment while leveraging the enormous momentum of Linux. The soon to be released technology brief will further explain our architecture and plans for integrating all of the selected technology. Once you read it, I am confident that you will understand the revolutionary nature of the next generation Amiga. I assure you that Amiga and the Amiga community will be a driving force behind the next computer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;revolution.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a person using Linux at the time, I believe this to have been the wrong decision. Despite the momentum that Linux had, it wasn’t (still isn’t) as stable, as reliable, or as efficient as QNX. If network performance were a serious consideration, one of the BSDs would have been the better choice. Linux’s hardware support also wasn’t that great in reality. While it could run on quite a bit of kit, it didn’t always support that hardware well, and it didn’t always support all features. Plus, QNX was doing the work to build drivers for the new Amiga. Of course, none of this really mattered. Gateway chose to divest itself of Amiga entirely. The new Amiga Inc. then turned to AmigaOne Partners for Amiga OS 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QNX Neutrino 2.1 was released in 1999 with support for Java, the Glide API, a wide array of microcontrollers, ARM, StrongARM, and Hitachi SH-4. Interestingly, this release had beta packages including RealPlayer and X in Photon, and it had experimental packages that included Quake 3 Arena and Doom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 14th of September in 1999, QNX made an announcement that would shape the future of QNX. The company was partnering with Motorola to develop automobile driver information systems that included in-vehicle navigation, internet access, natural language processing, car audio, multimedia, and vehicle information dashboards. While the Motorola unit responsible for mobileGT wouldn’t last and the unit at IBM working on Java wouldn’t last, QNX would survive and thrive in that segment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QNX version 6 was released on the 18th of January in 2001. The new version was focused on multimedia with streaming video and audio as well as hardware accelerated MPEG encode/decode. The new system included a web based package manager greatly easing the installation of available software. Thankfully, all supported architectures could now be used for developing QNX native software too. Version 6.1 was mostly a patch release and followed later the same year. QSSL was a founding member of the Eclipse Foundation, and QNX software development got quite a bit better with the release of the Momentics Tool Suite on the 4th of June in 2002 (along with QNX 6.2). This was largely the Eclipse IDE combined with a series of plugins that were QNX and Photon oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last release of QNX by QSSL was version 6.3 on the 3rd of June in 2004. This version was visually slightly different, and Voyager was replaced by the Mozilla Suite. The development environment was improved and now offered a clustering framework for the development of networked applications utilizing distributed processing. Among the highlights for this release were SCTP support, IP filter and NAT support, IPv6 support, 2D and 3D graphics layering/compositing, full UTF8 support in Photon, USB2 host support, and support for up to 64GB of RAM on x86 and PPC, up to 1TB on MIPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 27th of October in 2004, QNX Software Systems Limited was purchased by Harman International Industries. Harman specifically wanted to focus on QNX Neutrino in the embedded market, and within that market, specifically on automotive applications where Harman had found a market in audio. Under Harman’s ownership, QNX operated as a separate division led by Dan Dodge as CEO. While QNX did continue to serve networking, medical, and industrial markets, the direction was clear. What had begun with the Motorola partnership in automotive would become the primary market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QNX development continued with 6.3 SP1, SP2, and SP3. Version 6.3.2 was released on the 16th of August in 2006, 6.4 on the 30th of October in 2008, and 6.4.1 in May of 2009. Throughout that time period, QNX had introduced support for Adobe Flash and developed the QNX CAR platform winning a trophy from Adobe for their efforts. This platform was built of modular components allowing manufacturers to mix and match based upon the market segment. QNX was chosen by companies like BMW, Mercedes, Dodge, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Audi. When QNX demoed their automotive systems in the 2007-2009 timeframe, they had concept dashboards. These all ran QNX Neutrino on ARM CPUs (often Freescale i.MX6 or TI Sitara [Cortex A8]) with the EtherCAT motion library, and many demo units had UIs created in Qt5 and QML while a few had hardware accelerated OpenGL interfaces. From 2008 to 2010, QNX had been licensed for use in more than 17 million in-vehicle systems representing an increase of around 130% over those two years. By March of 2010, more than 200 vehicles were already shipping with QNX, and the QNX CAR platform had more than 60 participants. Those participants included 17 auto makers and 26 automotive suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 9th of April in 2010, Research in Motion announced their acquisition of QSS from Harman for $200 million:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“RIM is excited about the planned acquisition of QNX Software Systems and we look forward to ongoing collaboration between Harman, QNX and RIM to further integrate and enhance the user experience between smartphones and in-vehicle audio and infotainment systems," said Mike Lazaridis, President and Co-CEO at RIM. "In addition to our interests in expanding the opportunities for QNX in the automotive sector and other markets, we believe the planned acquisition of QNX will also bring other value to RIM in terms of supporting certain unannounced product plans for intelligent peripherals, adding valuable intellectual property to RIM's portfolio and providing long-term synergies for the companies based on the significant and complementary OS expertise that exists within the RIM and QNX teams today."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"We welcome the opportunities that a strengthened relationship with RIM will create, as two innovation leaders collaborate to bring new connectivity solutions to the industry," said Dinesh C. Paliwal, Harman's Chairman, President and CEO. "We expect to maintain our close association with QNX and the cutting-edge software solutions it provides to Harman and our customers. We believe our leading customers will fully endorse this move and see it as a major step in advancing seamless connectivity and integration among intelligent devices."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Like Harman, RIM shares our passion for innovation and reliability, so we are absolutely thrilled with this opportunity," said Dan Dodge, CEO, QNX Software Systems. "Moreover, RIM will give us the best of all possible mandates: to continue on our innovation path and to increase investment in our core products, professional services, and go-to-market channels. This is a great time to be a QNX customer, as we focus on collaborating with RIM to create an even more exciting platform for the next generation of connected and embedded devices."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also in 2010, QNX gained the QNX Safety kernel variant. This was a version of Neutrino that was security hardened specifically for mission critical applications. This variant continues to this day with the most recent version (8.0) having been independently certified by TÜV Rheinland to meet several standards including ISO 26262 ASIL D, IEC 61508 SIL3, IEC 62304 Class C, and ISO/SAE 21434. Aside from security hardening, the QNX Safety variant is still fully compatible with Neutrino’s native APIs and POSIX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In July of 2010, QNX Neutrino 6.5 was released. This version brought performance improvements to the kernel when systems were seeing high memory utilization, the kernel gained zombie reaping, and it gained address space randomization. SMP support was increased, and CPU support was extended to ARMv7 Cortex A-9. The Photon microGUI saw some refinements. As one would expect, version updates were present for everything imported from BSD, Linux, and GNU. This version could make use of the NetBSD’s Pkgsrc tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Version 6.5 was forked to create both the BlackBerry Tablet OS and BBX shortly after its creation. The first device to see a QNX-derived operating system from RIM was the PlayBook, which featured an OMAP 4430 SoC (1.5 GHz dual-core A9), PowerVR SGX540 GPU, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of eMMC flash, a 1024 by 600 seven inch LCD, Bluetooth, 802.11n, USB2, micro HDMI, a 5MP rear camera, and a 3MP front camera. It measured 5.1 inches by 7.6 inches, was about 2/5 of inch thick, and it weighed just under a pound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PlayBook was released on the 19th of April in 2011 to mixed reviews. While many loved the webkit browser, user interface, HDMI output, and multitasking, many loathed the requirement of a BlackBerry to get certain apps working. Additionally, there was a dearth of third party applications. This latter complaint did get ameliorated. While at launch there weren’t too many applications, this grew to over 24,000 by the same time the following year. Around 2,465,000 PlayBooks had been sold by June of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BlackBerry Z10 was released on the 31st of January in 2013 running BBX (officially BlackBerry 10 due to a trademark dispute, and at the launch event for BBX, Research in Motion announced that they were changing their name to BlackBerry Limited). The Z10 was built around a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus SoC (dual core 1.5GHz Krait CPU, Adreno 225 GPU) for LTE units, or around the TI OMAP 4470 for non-LTE units. The shell was plastic wrapped around a stainless steel inner frame, and the on/off, voice command, and volume buttons on the right side were of metal. While it didn’t have quite the premium feel of an iPhone, it did feel good in the hand. In its dimensions it was 5.1 inches by 2.6 inches, and just over an 1/3 of an inch thick (or just slightly larger than an iPhone 5). It was a slick piece of kit with a high price for the time at $599. The display, however, was excellent. It was a 4.2 inch LCD with a resolution of 1280 by 768 at 355ppi (the iPhone 5 was 326ppi). The device had a 2MP font camera, and an 8MP rear camera capable of HDR, panorama, and 1080p video at 30fps. Wi-Fi was dual band 802.11n, and the device featured Bluetooth, GPS, and NFC. Of course, connectivity didn’t stop there. This device had physical ports: micro USB2, micro HDMI, and 3.5mm audio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BBX made heavy use of gestures with a swipe up from the bottom taking the user to the Home Screen, a swipe to right to hit the App Library, and a swipe to the left going to the BlackBerry Hub. The Hub was a combination of SMS/MMS, email, social media, chat, notifications, and calls in a single unified location. BBX was QNX Neutrino, but it did differ. Multitasking was limited to 8 applications at any one time which I believe to have been done due to the application frameworks. A developer could choose to use C/C++ and the Cascades UI framework, or WebWorks which utilized HTML5 with Zepto.js (JQuery API, but 8.4k compressed), or WebKit, or Adobe AIR (Flash), or Android runtime. With so many different application types, decisions would have had to have been made around resource management, and a best guess at when performance would become unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry had been unable to compete against the iPhone and Android, and BBX was their last, best hope. By 2014, BBX was in the number four spot behind Windows Phone. By 2017, it was clear that they weren’t going to survive in the mobile market. Due to the extreme devotion of their fans, they kept BBX on life support until 2022. Being an amazing OS running on good hardware, why did BBX fail? Likely, the most pressing problem was application support. While BBX could run some Android applications, support was limited. The platform likewise failed to grab many developers as the existing install bases for iOS and Android were enormous. What applications were made for BBX were often of quite low effort. Finally, moving to a touch screen angered BlackBerry’s existing fanbase. For those individuals hanging on to the BlackBerry ecosystem, the keyboard was one of the main reasons why. Removing the physical keyboard made many of those fans feel betrayed. When BlackBerry Limited did release another phone with a physical keyboard, it was a bit too late.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 20th of September in 2013, BlackBerry Limited announced a 4500 person staff reduction and $1 billion (CAD) loss. On the 23rd, they announced an acquisition by Fairfax Financial Holdings for $9/share. This deal was canceled in November. Instead, John Chen became CEO and initiated a turn around that focused on QNX’s former markets of healthcare, finance, law, and mission critical systems. This focus allowed the company to pick up Ford Motor Company as a QNX customer on the 11th of December in 2014 (Ford had previously used Microsoft Auto).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 28th of February in 2014, BlackBerry released QNX 6.6. The supported platforms were now the expected x86 and ARM CPUs with no mention of any others. This was a major change despite being a point release. Photon support was removed in favor of the Screen Graphics Subsystem. Screen operates as a lower-level service, and this has the benefit of supporting off-screen rendering and compositing of various image sources, and as QNX software had been increasingly using Qt, HTML5, or OpenGL rather than the toolkits supplied with Photon, this made logical sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QNX version 7 was released on the 4th of January in 2017 for ARM v7, ARM v8, x86, and AMD64. This release featured a rewritten PCI server with APIs moved out of libc and into libpci, rewritten virtual memory manager, fewer synchronization objects with increased limits, and filesystem encryption was moved into the Encrypted Filesystem package available from QNX Software Centry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By June of 2023, QNX was in over 255 million vehicles around the world, and this would explain why the BlackBerry blog featured a rather large section on automobiles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The automotive evolution to SDVs and “connected cars” requires an OS capable of speed, safety, and security — while unlocking the power to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"With more than 300 million vehicles capable of over-the-air software updates expected to be on the road globally by 2032, automakers are clamoring for better tools to help them develop compelling technology features in the software-defined vehicle," says Alex Oyler, director of North America at SBD Automotive, a leading global automotive technology research and consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Both automakers and suppliers rely on validated software and well-integrated development tools to help them more efficiently build and maintain differentiating software for their fleets,” Oyler adds. "A secured-by-design operating system such as the next generation QNX OS — that seamlessly integrates with other software components on a high-performance system-on-chip — represents the foundation of a safe, secure, and seamless experience for drivers.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In addition, early reviews of the new QNX SDP 8.0 give automotive industry leaders a glimpse into what’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The combination of our DRIVE Thor centralized computer and the new QNX OS will serve as a powerful foundation on which OEMs can build next-generation automotive systems that offer the highest levels of safety and security,” says Ali Kani, vice president and general manager of automotive at NVIDIA. “This represents another major milestone in a nearly 20-year collaboration with BlackBerry QNX that has helped both companies move to the forefront of the automotive industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QNX 8.0 was officially announced in December of 2023, and the release was made in January of 2024. Version 8.0 was quickly discontinued with 8.0.1 taking its place. Version 8.0.3 was made available on the 21st of March in 2024. This latest release is available for a variety of Aarch64 platforms including the Raspberry Pi, and is also available for AMD64. QNX 8 supports SoCs with up to 64 cores and has near linear performance scaling. The network stack is now based upon FreeBSD 13.2, Wi-Fi 6 support is present with WPA3 and TLS 1.3, Screen can operate fully headless and now supports Vulkan 1.3 and OpenCL 3, and Screen now supports Wayland 1.21. Developers are now encouraged to use LLVM and libc++ 16 though GCC is still available with libstdc++ 12.2. Python 3.11, valgrind, libasan (address sanitizer), libubsan (undefined behavior detection), and libunwind are all available. For the UNIX user land, Toybox has replaced many common GNU utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the Raspberry Pi port caught your attention, this is available free for non-commercial use via QNX Everywhere. The image requires a Raspberry Pi 4 with at least 2GB of RAM and an 8GB or greater MicroSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 2nd of January in 2025, it was announced that BlackBerry IoT would now be known as QNX. This decision was made largely by BlackBerry responding to their customers who recognized and desired the QNX brand. QNX CEO John Giamatteo stated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Relaunching the QNX brand is an important step in BlackBerry’s broader strategy to increase our visibility and fortify our leadership within the automotive and embedded industries, with a view to better positioning us for sustained growth and success. The values that QNX stands for have always been a cornerstone for our customers and this brand relaunch honors that strong history while setting the stage for the division to fire on all cylinders and drive smarter, safer, and faster innovation through precision-engineered performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QNX is a fascinating operating system. It was extremely well designed from the start, and while it has been rewritten, the core ideas that allowed it survive for 45 years persist to this day. While I am sad that Photon was deprecated, the reasoning is sound. Most vendors using QNX either do not require a GUI, or they implement their own. For example, while Boston Dynamics uses QNX in their robots, they don’t really need Photon, and neither do SpaceX’s Falcon rockets. While cars certainly have displays, most vehicle makers desire their screen interfaces to have a unique look and feel. Of course, just stating these use cases of robots, rockets, and cars speaks to the incredible reliability and versatility of QNX. Better operating systems are possible, and QNX proves it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This website gathers material related to the Sun Microsystems Network File System, a project that began in 1983 and remains a fundamental technology for today’s distributed computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The occasion which prompted this project was the ~40th anniversary of NFS, celebrated in September 2025 at the MSST Conference in Santa Clara, CA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of the collection is design documents, white papers, engineering specifications, conference and journal papers, and standards material. However it also covers marketing materials, trade press, advertising, books, “swag”, and personal ephemera. We’re always looking for new contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve organized the material in four sections:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise noted, everything is downloadable from this site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A full list of the Internet RFCs related to NFS can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a site, nfsv4bat.org, which seems to include a variety of materials related to NFS after 1995, especially Connectathons. However, be careful: the site is insecure, load times are insanely slow, and it is unclear whether it’s still being maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This website was created with the help of (alphabetically) Russel Berg, Russ Cox, Steve Kleiman, Bob Lyon, Tom Lyon, Joseph Moran, Brian Pawlowski, David Rosenthal, and Kate Stout. Please send any comments or suggestions to me, Geoff Arnold, via email. Last updated .&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Computation and Language&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 2 Sep 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for RLVR&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor $\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32 and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards.

Korean government's cloud storage system, no backups available</title><link>https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-10-01/national/socialAffairs/NIRS-fire-destroys-governments-cloud-storage-system-no-backups-available/2412936</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="fd40bb1beeb70fe1"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;NIRS fire destroys government's cloud storage system, no backups available&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Published: 01 Oct. 2025, 17:59 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fire at the National Information Resources Service (NIRS)'s Daejeon headquarters destroyed the government’s G-Drive cloud storage system, erasing work files saved individually by some 750,000 civil servants, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fire broke out in the server room on the fifth floor of the center, damaging 96 information systems designated as critical to central government operations, including the G-Drive platform. The G-Drive has been in use since 2018, requiring government officials to store all work documents in the cloud instead of on personal computers. It provided around 30 gigabytes of storage per person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, due to the system’s large-capacity, low-performance storage structure, no external backups were maintained — meaning all data has been permanently lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scale of damage varies by agency. The Ministry of Personnel Management, which had mandated that all documents be stored exclusively on G-Drive, was hit hardest. The Office for Government Policy Coordination, which used the platform less extensively, suffered comparatively less damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Personnel Ministry stated that all departments are expected to experience work disruptions. It is currently working to recover alternative data using any files saved locally on personal computers within the past month, along with emails, official documents and printed records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Interior Ministry noted that official documents created through formal reporting or approval processes were also stored in the government’s Onnara system and may be recoverable once that system is restored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Final reports and official records submitted to the government are also stored in OnNara, so this is not a total loss,” said a director of public services at the Interior Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Interior Ministry explained that while most systems at the Daejeon data center are backed up daily to separate equipment within the same center and to a physically remote backup facility, the G-Drive’s structure did not allow for external backups. This vulnerability ultimately left it unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Criticism continues to build regarding the government's data management protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyright 1994 Rich Hickey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the many promises of Object-Oriented programming is that it will allow for plug-and-play software design with re-usable components. Designers will pull objects from their library 'shelves' and hook them together to make software. In C++, this hooking together of components can be tricky, particulary if they are separately designed. We are still a long way from interoperable libraries and application components. Callbacks provide a mechanism whereby independently developed objects may be connected together. They are vital for plug and play programming, since the likelihood of Vendor A implementing their library in terms of Vendor B's classes, or your home-brewed classes, is nil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callbacks are in wide use, however current implementations differ and most suffer from shortcomings, not the least of which is their lack of generality. This article describes what callbacks are, how they are used, and the criteria for a good callback mechanism. It summarizes current callback methods and their weaknesses. It then describes a flexible, powerful and easy-to-use callback technique based on template functors - objects that behave like functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALLBACK FUNDAMENTALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Are Callbacks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When designing application or sub-system specific components we often know all of the classes with which the component will interact and thus explicity code interfaces in terms of those classes. When designing general purpose or library components however, it is often necessary or desirable to put in hooks for calling unknown objects. What is required is a way for one component to call another without having been written in terms of, or with knowledge of, the other component's type. Such a 'type-blind' call mechanism is often referred to as a callback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A callback might be used for simple notification, two-way communication, or to distribute work in a process. For instance an application developer might want to have a &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
component in a GUI library call an application-specific object when&amp;#13;
clicked upon.  The designer of a data entry component might want to&amp;#13;
offer the capability to call application objects for input validation.&amp;#13;
Collection classes often offer an &lt;code&gt;apply()&lt;/code&gt; function, which&amp;#13;
'applies' a member function of an application object to the items they&amp;#13;
contain.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A callback, then, is a way for a component designer to offer a generic connection point which developers can use to establish communication with application objects. At some subsequent point, the component 'calls back' the application object. The communication takes the form of a function call, since this is the way objects interact in C++.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callbacks are useful in many contexts. If you use any commercial class libraries you have probably seen at least one mechanism for providing callbacks. All callback implementations must address a fundamental problem posed by the C++ type system: How can you build a component such that it can call a member function of another object whose type is unknown at the time the component is designed? C++'s type system requires that we know something of the type of any object whose member functions we wish to call, and is often criticized by fans of other OO languages as being too inflexible to support true component-based design, since all the components have to 'know' about each other. C++'s strong typing has too many advantages to abandon, but addressing this apparent lack of flexibility may encourage the proliferation of robust and interoperable class libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C++ is in fact quite flexible, and the mechanism presented here leverages its flexibility to provide this functionality without language extension. In particular, templates supply a powerful tool for solving problems such as this. If you thought templates were only for container classes, read on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callback Terminology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three elements in any callback mechanism - the caller, the callback function, and the callee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caller is usually an instance of some class, for instance a library component (although it could be a function, like &lt;code&gt;qsort()&lt;/code&gt;), that provides or requires the callback; i.e.  it&amp;#13;
can, or must, call some third party code to perform its work, and uses&amp;#13;
the callback mechanism to do so.  As far as the designer of the caller&amp;#13;
is concerned, the callback is just a way to invoke a process, referred&amp;#13;
to here as the callback function. The caller determines the&amp;#13;
signature of the callback function i.e.  its argument(s) and return&amp;#13;
types.  This makes sense, because it is the caller that has the work to&amp;#13;
do, or the information to convey.  For instance, in the examples above,&amp;#13;
the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; class may want a callback function with no&amp;#13;
arguments and no return.  It is a simple notification function used by&amp;#13;
the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; to indicate it has been clicked upon.  The&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;DataEntryField&lt;/code&gt; component might want to pass a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
to the callback function and get a &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt; return.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A caller may require the callback for just the duration of one function, as with ANSI C's &lt;code&gt;qsort()&lt;/code&gt;, or may want to hold on&amp;#13;
to the callback in order to call back at some later time, as with the&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; class.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The callee is usually a member function of an object of some class, but it can also be a stand-alone function or static member function, that the application designer wishes to be called by the caller component. Note that in the case of a non-static member function a particular object/member-function pair is the callee. The function to be called must be compatible with the signature of the callback function specified by the caller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criteria for a Good Callback Mechanism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A callback mechanism in the object oriented model should support both component and application design. Component designers should have a standard, off-the-shelf way of providing callback services, requiring no invention on their part. Flexibility in specifying the number and types of argument and return values should be provided. Since the component may be designed for use in as-yet-unthought-of applications, the component designer should neither need to know, nor dictate, the types of the objects which may be 'called back' by the component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application developers, given a component with this standard callback mechanism and some instance of a class with a member function compatible with the callback function signature, should have to do no custom 'glue' coding in order to connect the two together. Nor should they have to modify the callee class or hand-derive a new class. If they want to have the callback invoke a stand-alone, non-member function, that should be supported as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support this behavior the callback mechanism should be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Object Oriented - Our applications are built with objects. In a C++ application most functionality is contained in member functions, which cannot be invoked via normal ptr-to-functions. Non-static member functions operate upon objects, which have state. Calling such functions is more than just invoking a process, it is operating upon a particular object, thus an object-oriented callback must contain information about which object to call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type Safe - Type safety is a fundamental feature and benefit of C++ and any robust C++ callback mechanism must be type safe. That means we must ensure that objects are used in compliance with their specified interfaces, and that type rules are enforced for arguments, return values, and conversions. The best way to ensure this is to have the compiler do the work at compile time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Coupling - This is the fundamental goal of callbacks - to allow components designed in ignorance of each other to be connected together. If the mechanism somehow introduces a dependancy between caller and callee it has failed in its basic mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Type-Intrusive - Some mechanisms for doing callbacks require a modification to, or derivation of, the caller or callee types. The fact that an object is connected to another object in a particular application often has nothing to do with its type. As we'll see below, mechanisms that are type intrusive can reduce the flexibility and increase the complexity of application code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generic - The primary differences between different callback situations are the types involved. This suggests that the callback mechanism should be parameterized using templates. Templates insure consistent interfaces and names in all callback situations, and provide a way to have any necessary support code be generated by the compiler, not the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexible - Experience has shown that callback systems that require an exact match between callback function and callee function signatures are too rigid for real-world use. For instance you may encounter a callback that passes a &lt;code&gt;Derived *&lt;/code&gt; that you want to connect to a callee&amp;#13;
function that takes a &lt;code&gt;Base *&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CURRENT MECHANISMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function Model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest callback mechanism is a pointer-to-function, a la ANSI C's &lt;code&gt;qsort()&lt;/code&gt;.  Getting a stand-alone function to act upon a&amp;#13;
particular object, however, usually involves kludges like using static&amp;#13;
or global pointers to indicate the target object, or having the callback&amp;#13;
function take an extra parameter (usually a pointer to the object to act&amp;#13;
upon). The static/global pointer method breaks down when the callback&amp;#13;
relationship exists across calls, i.e.  'I want to connect this Button&amp;#13;
to this X and this other Button to this other X, for the duration of the&amp;#13;
app'.  The extra paramter method, if done type-safely, introduces&amp;#13;
undesirable coupling between the caller and callee types.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;qsort()&lt;/code&gt; achieves its genericity by foregoing type safety.  i.e.,&amp;#13;
in order for it to be ignorant of the types it is manipulating it takes&amp;#13;
untyped (&lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;) arguments.  There is nothing to prevent&amp;#13;
someone from calling &lt;code&gt;qsort()&lt;/code&gt; on an array of apples and&amp;#13;
passing a pointer to a function that compares oranges!&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this typeless mechanism you'll frequently see is the 'apply' function in collections. The purpose of an apply function is to allow a developer to pass a callback to a collection and have it be 'applied' to (called on) each item in the collection. Unfortunately it often looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;void apply(void (*func)(T &amp;amp;theItem,void *extraStuff),void *theStuff);&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are really good you don't have a function like &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; sitting around, so you'll have&amp;#13;
to write one (lots of casting required). And make sure you pass it the&amp;#13;
right stuff. Ugh.                                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single Rooted Hierarchy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beware of callback mechanisms that appear type safe but are in fact not. These mechanisms usually involve some base-of-all-classes like Object or EventHandler, and utilize casts from ptr-to-member-of-derived to ptr-to-member-of-base. Experience has indicated that single-rooted systems are unworkable if components are to come from multiple sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parameterize the Caller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The component designer could parameterize the component on the type of the callee. Such parameterization is inappropriate in many situations and callbacks are one of them. Consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;class Button{ public: virtual void click(); //... }; template &amp;lt;class T&amp;gt; class ButtonThatCallsBack:public class Button{ public: ButtonThatCalls(T *who,void (T::*func)(void)): callee(who),callback(func){} void click() { (callee-&amp;gt;*callback)(); } private: T *callee; void (T::*callback)(void); }; class CDPlayer{ public: void play(); //... }; //Connect a CDPlayer and a Button CDPlayer cd; ButtonThatCallsBack&amp;lt;CDPlayer&amp;gt; button(&amp;amp;cd,&amp;amp;CDPlayer::play); button.click(); //calls cd.play()&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;ButtonThatCallsBack&amp;lt;CDPlayer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; would thus 'know'&amp;#13;
about &lt;code&gt;CDPlayer&lt;/code&gt; and provides an interface explicitly based&amp;#13;
on it.  The problem is that this introduces rigidity in the system in&amp;#13;
that the callee type becomes part of the caller type, i.e.  it is&amp;#13;
'type-intrusive'.  All code that creates&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;ButtonThatCallsBack&lt;/code&gt; objects must be made aware of the&amp;#13;
callee relationship, increasing coupling in the system.  A&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;ButtonThatCallsBack&amp;lt;X&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;is of a different type than a&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;ButtonThatCallsBack&amp;lt;Y&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, thus preventing by-value&amp;#13;
manipulation.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a component has many callback relationships it quickly becomes unworkable to parameterize them all. Consider a &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
that wants to maintain a dynamic list of callees to be notified upon a&amp;#13;
click event. Since the callee type is built into the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
class type, this list must be either homogeneous or typeless.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Library code cannot even create &lt;code&gt;ButtonThatCallsBack&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
objects because their instantiation depends on application types.  This&amp;#13;
is a severe constraint.  Consider GUI library code that reads a dialog&amp;#13;
description from a resource file and creates a &lt;code&gt;Dialog&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
object. How can it know that you want the &lt;code&gt;Buttons&lt;/code&gt; in that&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Dialog&lt;/code&gt; to call back &lt;code&gt;CDPlayers&lt;/code&gt;? It can't,&amp;#13;
therefore it can't create the &lt;code&gt;Buttons&lt;/code&gt; for you.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callee Mix-In&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caller component designer can invent an abstract base class to be the target of the callback, and indicate to application developers that they mix-in this base in order to connect their class with the component. I call this the "callee mix-in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the designer of the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; class wants to&amp;#13;
offer a click notification callback, and so defines a nested class&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Notifiable&lt;/code&gt; with a pure virtual function &lt;code&gt;notify()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
that has the desired signature.  Clients of the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
class will have to pass to its constructor a pointer to a&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Notifiable&lt;/code&gt;, which the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; will use (at&amp;#13;
some point later on) for notification of clicks:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;class Button{ public: class Notifiable{ public: virtual void notify()=0; }; Button(Notifiable *who):callee(who){} void click() {callee-&amp;gt;notify();} private: Notifiable *callee; }; Given : class CDPlayer{ public: void play(); //... };&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;an application developer wishing to have a &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; call&amp;#13;
back a &lt;code&gt;CDPlayer&lt;/code&gt; would have to derive a new class from both&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;CDPlayer&lt;/code&gt; and&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Button::Notifiable&lt;/code&gt;, overriding the pure virtual function&amp;#13;
to do the desired work:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;class MyCDPlayer:public CDPlayer,public Button::Notifiable{ public: void notify() {play();} };&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;and use this class rather than &lt;code&gt;CDPlayer&lt;/code&gt; in the&amp;#13;
application:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;MyCDPlayer cd; Button button(&amp;amp;cd); button.click(); //calls cd.play()&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism is type safe, achieves the decoupling of &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
and&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;CDPlayer&lt;/code&gt;, and is good magazine article fodder.  It is&amp;#13;
almost useless in practice, however.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with the callee mix-in is that it, too, is type-intrusive, i.e. it impacts the type of the callee, in this case by forcing derivation. This has three major flaws. First, the use of multiple inheritance, particularly if the callee is a callee of multiple components, is problematic due to name clashes etc. Second, derivation may be impossible, for instance if the application designer gets &lt;code&gt;CDPlayers&lt;/code&gt; from an unchangeable, untouchable API (library&amp;#13;
designers note: this is a big problem with mix-in based mechanisms in&amp;#13;
general).  The third problem is best demonstrated.  Consider this&amp;#13;
version of &lt;code&gt;CDPlayer&lt;/code&gt;:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;class CDPlayer{ public: void play(); void stop(); //... };&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't seem unreasonable to have an application where one &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
calls &lt;code&gt;CDPlayer::play()&lt;/code&gt; and another &lt;code&gt;CDPlayer::stop()&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
 The mix-in mechanism fails completely here, since it can only support a&amp;#13;
single mapping between caller/callee/member-function, i.e. &lt;code&gt;MyCDPlayer&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
can have only one &lt;code&gt;notify()&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALLBACKS USING TEMPLATE FUNCTORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first thought about the inter-component callback problem I decided that what was needed was a language extension to support 'bound-pointers', special pointers representing information about an object and a member function of that object, storable and callable much like regular pointers to functions. ARM 5.5 commentary has a brief explanation of why bound pointers were left out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would bound pointers work? Ideally you would initialize them with either a regular pointer-to-function or a reference to an object and a pointer-to-member-function. Once initialized, they would behave like normal pointer-to-functions. You could apply the function call &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt; to them to invoke the function. In order to be&amp;#13;
suitable for a callback mechanism, the information about the type of the&amp;#13;
callee would _not_ be part of the type of the bound-pointer. It might&amp;#13;
look something like this:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Warning - NOT C++ class Fred{ public: void foo(); }; Fred fred; void (* __bound fptr)() = &amp;amp;fred.foo;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;fptr&lt;/code&gt; is a bound-pointer to a function that takes&amp;#13;
no arguments and returns &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that &lt;code&gt;Fred&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
is not part of &lt;code&gt;fptr's&lt;/code&gt; type.  It is initialized with the&amp;#13;
object &lt;code&gt;fred&lt;/code&gt; and a pointer-to-member-function-of-Fred,&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;.  Saying:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;fptr();&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;would invoke &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;fred&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such bound-pointers would be ideal for callbacks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Warning - NOT C++ class Button{ public: Button(void (* __bound uponClickDoThis)() ) :notify(uponClickDoThis) {} void click() { notify(); } private: void (* __bound notify)(); }; class CDPlayer{ public: void play(); }; CDPlayer cd; Button button(&amp;amp;cd.play); button.click(); //calls cd.play()&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bound-pointers would require a non-trivial language extension and some tricky compiler support. Given the extreme undesirability of any new language features I'd hardly propose bound-pointers now. Nevertheless I still consider the bound-pointer concept to be the correct solution for callbacks, and set out to see how close I could get in the current and proposed language. The result is the Callback library described below. As it turns out, the library solution can not only deliver the functionality shown above (albeit with different syntax), it proved more flexible than the language extension would have been!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning from the fantasy world of language extension, the library must provide two things for the user. The first is some construct to play the role of the 'bound-pointer'. The second is some method for creating these 'bound-pointers' from either a regular pointer-to-function or an object and a pointer-to-member-function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 'bound-pointer' role we need an object that behaves like a function. Coplien has used the term functor to describe such objects. For our purposes a functor is simply an object that behaves like a pointer-to-function. It has an &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
(the function call operator) which can be used to invoke the function to&amp;#13;
which it points.  The library provides a set of template &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
classes.  They hold any necessary callee data and provide&amp;#13;
pointer-to-function like behavior. Most important, their type has no&amp;#13;
connection whatsoever to the callee type.  Components define their&amp;#13;
callback interface using the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; classes.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The construct provided by the library for creating functors is an overloaded template function, &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt;, which&amp;#13;
takes as arguments the callee information (either an object and a&amp;#13;
ptr-to-member-function, or a ptr-to-function) and returns something&amp;#13;
suitable for initializing a&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; object.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting mechanism is very easy to use. A complete example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;#include &amp;lt;callback.h&amp;gt; //include the callback library header #include &amp;lt;iostream.h&amp;gt; class Button{ public: Button(const Functor0 &amp;amp;uponClickDoThis) :notify(uponClickDoThis) {} void click() { notify(); //a call to operator() } private: Functor0 notify; //note - held by value }; //Some application stuff we'd like to connect to Button: class CDPlayer{ public: void play(){cout&amp;lt;&amp;lt;"Playing"&amp;lt;&amp;lt;endl;} void stop(){cout&amp;lt;&amp;lt;"Stopped"&amp;lt;&amp;lt;endl;} }; void wow() {cout&amp;lt;&amp;lt;"Wow!"&amp;lt;&amp;lt;endl;} void main() { CDPlayer cd; //makeFunctor from object and ptr-to-member-function Button playButton(makeFunctor(cd,&amp;amp;CDPlayer::play)); Button stopButton(makeFunctor(cd,&amp;amp;CDPlayer::stop)); //makeFunctor from pointer-to-function Button wowButton(makeFunctor(&amp;amp;wow)); playButton.click(); //calls cd.play() stopButton.click(); //calls cd.stop() wowButton.click(); //calls wow() }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voila! A component (&lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;) has been connected to&amp;#13;
application objects and functions it knows nothing about and that know&amp;#13;
nothing about &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;, without any custom coding,&amp;#13;
derivation or modification of the objects involved.  And it's type safe.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; class designer specifies the callback&amp;#13;
interface in terms of&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Functor0&lt;/code&gt;, a functor that takes no arguments and returns&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;.  It stores the functor away in its member &lt;code&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
 When it comes time to call back, it simply calls &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
on the functor.  This looks and feels just like a call via a&amp;#13;
pointer-to-function.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecting something to a component that uses callbacks is simple. You can just initialize a &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; with the result&amp;#13;
of an appropriate call to&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt;.  There are two flavors of &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
 You can call it with a ptr-to-stand-alone function:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;makeFunctor(&amp;amp;wow)&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;OR with an object and a pointer-to-member function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;makeFunctor(cd,&amp;amp;CDPlayer::play)&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must come clean at this point, and point out that the syntax above for &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt; is possible only in the proposed language,&amp;#13;
because it requires template members (specifically, the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
constructors would have to be templates).  In the current language the&amp;#13;
same result can be achieved by passing to &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt; a&amp;#13;
dummy parameter of type ptr-to-the-Functor-type-you-want-to-create. This&amp;#13;
iteration of the callback library requires you pass &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
the dummy as the first parameter.  Simply cast &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to&amp;#13;
provide this argument:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;makeFunctor((Functor0 *)0,&amp;amp;wow) makeFunctor((Functor0 *)0,cd,&amp;amp;CDPlayer::play);&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will use this current-language syntax from here on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; class above only needs a callback&amp;#13;
function with no arguments that returns &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;.  Other&amp;#13;
components may want to pass data to the callback or get a return back.&amp;#13;
The only things distinguishing one functor from another are the number&amp;#13;
and types of the arguments to &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt; and its return&amp;#13;
type, if any. This indicates that functors can be represented in the&amp;#13;
library by (a set of) templates:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;//Functor classes provided by the Callback library: Functor0 //not a template - nothing to parameterize Functor1&amp;lt;P1&amp;gt; Functor2&amp;lt;P1,P2&amp;gt; Functor3&amp;lt;P1,P2,P3&amp;gt; Functor4&amp;lt;P1,P2,P3,P4&amp;gt; Functor0wRet&amp;lt;RT&amp;gt; Functor1wRet&amp;lt;P1,RT&amp;gt; Functor2wRet&amp;lt;P1,P2,RT&amp;gt; Functor3wRet&amp;lt;P1,P2,P3,RT&amp;gt; Functor4wRet&amp;lt;P1,P2,P3,P4,RT&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are parameterized by the types of their arguments (&lt;code&gt;P1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
etc) and return value (&lt;code&gt;RT&lt;/code&gt;) if any.  The numbering is&amp;#13;
necessary because we can't overload template class names on number of&amp;#13;
parameters.  '&lt;code&gt;wRet&lt;/code&gt;' is appended to distinguish those with&amp;#13;
return values.  Each has an &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt; with the&amp;#13;
corresponding signature, for example:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;template &amp;lt;class P1&amp;gt; class Functor1{ public: void operator()(P1 p1)const; //... }; template &amp;lt;class P1,class P2,class RT&amp;gt; class Functor2wRet{ public: RT operator()(P1 p1,P2 p2)const; //... };&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; classes are sufficient to meet the&amp;#13;
callback needs of component designers, as they offer a standard and&amp;#13;
consistent way to offer callback services, and a simple mechanism for&amp;#13;
invoking the callback function.  Given these templates in the library, a&amp;#13;
component designer need only pick one with the correct number of&amp;#13;
arguments and specify the desired types as parameters.  Here's the&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;DataEntryField&lt;/code&gt; that wants a validation callback that takes&amp;#13;
a &lt;code&gt;const String &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; and returns a&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;#include &amp;lt;callback.h&amp;gt; class DataEntryField{ public: DataEntryField(const Functor1wRet&amp;lt;const String &amp;amp;,Boolean&amp;gt; &amp;amp;v): validate(v){} void keyHit(const String &amp;amp; stringSoFar) { if(validate(stringSoFar)) // process it etc... } private: Functor1wRet&amp;lt;const String &amp;amp;,Boolean&amp;gt; validate; //validate has a //Boolean operator()(const String &amp;amp;) };&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These trivial examples just scratch the surface of what you can do given a general purpose callback library such as this. Consider their application to state machines, dispatch tables etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The callback library is 100% compile-time type safe. (Where compile time includes template-instantiation time). If you try to make a functor out of something that is not compatible with the functor type you will get a compiler error. All correct virtual function behavior is preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is also type flexible. You'll note that throughout this article I have said 'type compatible' rather than 'exactly-matching' when talking about the relationship between the callback function and the callee function. Experience has shown that requiring an exact match makes callbacks too rigid for practical use. If you have done much work with pointer-to-function based interfaces you've probably experienced the frustration of having a pointer to a function 'that would work' yet was not of the exact type required for a match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide flexibility the library supports building a functor out of a callee function that is 'type compatible' with the target functor - it need not have an exactly matching signature. By type compatible I mean a function with the same number of arguments, of types reachable from the functor's argument types by implicit conversion. The return type of the function must be implicitly convertible to the return type of the functor. A functor with no return can be built from a function with a return - the return value is safely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;//assumes Derived publicly derived from Base void foo(Base &amp;amp;); long bar(Derived &amp;amp;); Functor1&amp;lt;Derived&amp;amp;&amp;gt; f1 = makeFunctor((Functor1&amp;lt;Derived&amp;amp;&amp;gt; *)0,&amp;amp;foo); //ok - will implicitly convert f1 = makeFunctor((Functor1&amp;lt;Derived&amp;amp;&amp;gt; *)0,&amp;amp;bar); //ok - ignores return&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any necessary argument conversions or ignoring of returns is done by the compiler, i.e. there is no coercion done inside the mechanism or by the user. If the compiler can't get from the arguments passed to the functor to the arguments required by the callee function, the code is rejected at compile time. By allowing the compiler to do the work we get all of the normal conversions of arguments - derived to base, promotion and conversion of built-in types, and user-defined conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type-flexibility of the library is something that would not have been available in a language extension rendition of bound pointers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the functionality of the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
classes are a default constructor that will also accept &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
as an initializer, which puts the&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; in a known 'unset' state, and a conversion to&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to test whether the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
is 'set'.  The &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; classes do not rely on any virtual&amp;#13;
function behavior to work, thus they can be held and copied by-value.&amp;#13;
Thus a &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; has the same ease-of-use as a regular&amp;#13;
pointer-to-function.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point you know everything you need to use the callback library. All of the code is in one file, &lt;code&gt;callback.h&lt;/code&gt;.  To&amp;#13;
use a callback in a component class, simply instantiate a &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
with the desired argument types.  To connect some stuff to a component&amp;#13;
that uses &lt;code&gt;Functors&lt;/code&gt; for callbacks, simply call &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
on the stuff.  Easy.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power Templates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, what is easy for the user is often tricky for the implementor. Given the black-box descriptions above of the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
classes and &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt; it may be hard to swallow the&amp;#13;
claims of type-safety, transparent conversions, correct virtual function&amp;#13;
behavior etc.  A look behind the curtain reveals not only how it works,&amp;#13;
but also some neat template techniques.  Warning: most people find the&amp;#13;
pointer-to-member and template syntax used in the implementation&amp;#13;
daunting at first.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously some sort of magic is going on. How can the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
class, with no knowledge of the type or signature of the callee, ensure&amp;#13;
a type safe call to it, possibly with implicit conversions of the&amp;#13;
arguments?  It can't, so it doesn't.  The actual work must be performed&amp;#13;
by some code that knows both the functor callback signature and&amp;#13;
everything about the callee.  The trick is to get the compiler to&amp;#13;
generate that code, and have the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; to point to it.&amp;#13;
Templates can help out all around.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism is spread over three components - the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
class, a &lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt; class, and the &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
function.  All are templates.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; class is parameterized on the types of&amp;#13;
the callback function signature, holds the callee data in a typeless&amp;#13;
manner, and defines a typed &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt; but doesn't&amp;#13;
actually perform the work of calling back. Instead it holds a pointer to&amp;#13;
the actual callback code. When it comes time to call back, it passes the&amp;#13;
typeless data (itself actually), as well as the callback arguments, to&amp;#13;
this pointed-to function.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt; class is derived from &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
but is parameterized on both the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; type _and_ the&amp;#13;
callee types.  It knows about everything, and is thus able to define a&amp;#13;
fully type-safe static 'thunk' function that takes the typeless &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
data and the callback arguments.  It constructs its &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
base class with a pointer to this static function.  The thunk function&amp;#13;
does the work of calling back, turning the typeless &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
data back into a typed callee and calling the callee.  Since the &lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
does the work of converting the callee data to and from untyped data the&amp;#13;
conversions are considered 'safe'. The&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt; isA &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;, so it can be used to&amp;#13;
initialize a &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt; function takes the callee data,&amp;#13;
creates a&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt; out of it and returns the &lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
 Thus the &lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt; object exists only briefly as the&amp;#13;
return value of &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt;, but its creation is enough&amp;#13;
to cause the compiler to lay down the static 'thunk' function, the&amp;#13;
address of which is carried in the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; that has been&amp;#13;
initialized with the &lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this will become clearer with the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each of the 10 &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; classes there are 2&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt; classes and 3 versions of &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
 We'll examine a slice of the library here, &lt;code&gt;Functor1&lt;/code&gt; and&amp;#13;
its associated &lt;code&gt;Translators&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;makeFunctors&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
The other &lt;code&gt;Functors&lt;/code&gt; differ only in the number of args and&amp;#13;
return values.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Functors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; objects are the only entities&amp;#13;
held by the caller, they must contain the data about the callee.  With&amp;#13;
some care we can design a base class which can hold, in a typeless&amp;#13;
manner, the callee data, regardless of whether the callee is a&amp;#13;
ptr-to-function or object/ptr-to-member-function combo:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;//typeless representation of a function or object/mem-func class FunctorBase{ public: typedef void (FunctorBase::*_MemFunc)(); typedef void (*_Func)(); FunctorBase():callee(0),func(0){} FunctorBase(const void *c,const void *f,size_t sz) { if(c) //must be callee/memfunc { callee = (void *)c; memcpy(memFunc,f,sz); } else //must be ptr-to-func { func = f; } } //for evaluation in conditions //will be changed to bool when bool exists operator int()const{return func||callee;} class DummyInit{ }; //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // Note: this code depends on all ptr-to-mem-funcs being same size // If that is not the case then make memFunc as large as largest //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// union{ const void *func; char memFunc[sizeof(_MemFunc)]; }; void *callee; };&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All &lt;code&gt;Functors&lt;/code&gt; are derived (protected) from this base.&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;FunctorBase&lt;/code&gt; provides a constructor from typeless args,&amp;#13;
where if &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; the callee is a&amp;#13;
pointer-to-function and &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is that pointer, else &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
is pointer to the callee object and &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer to a&amp;#13;
pointer-to-member function and &lt;code&gt;sz&lt;/code&gt; is that&amp;#13;
ptr-to-member-function's size (in case an implementation has&amp;#13;
pointer-to-members of differing sizes).  It has a default constructor&amp;#13;
which inits to an 'unset' state, and an &lt;code&gt;operator int&lt;/code&gt; to&amp;#13;
allow for testing the state (set or unset).&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; class is a template.  It has a default&amp;#13;
constructor and the required &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt; corresponding to&amp;#13;
its template parameters. It uses the generated copy constructor and&amp;#13;
assignment operators.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;/************************* one arg - no return *******************/ template &amp;lt;class P1&amp;gt; class Functor1:protected FunctorBase{ public: Functor1(DummyInit * = 0){} void operator()(P1 p1)const { thunk(*this,p1); } FunctorBase::operator int; protected: typedef void (*Thunk)(const FunctorBase &amp;amp;,P1); Functor1(Thunk t,const void *c,const void *f,size_t sz): FunctorBase(c,f,sz),thunk(t){} private: Thunk thunk; };&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; class has a protected constructor that&amp;#13;
takes the same typeless args as &lt;code&gt;FunctorBase&lt;/code&gt;, plus an&amp;#13;
additional first argument.  This argument is a pointer to function (the&amp;#13;
thunk function) that takes the same arguments as the &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;#13;
plus an additional first argument of type &lt;code&gt;const FunctorBase &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
 The &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; stores this away (in thunk) and implements&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt; by calling &lt;code&gt;thunk()&lt;/code&gt;, passing&amp;#13;
itself and the other arguments.  Thus it is this &lt;code&gt;thunk()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
function that does the work of 'calling back'.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key issue at this point is whether &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
should be virtual. In the first iteration of my mechanism the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
classes were abstract and the &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt;'s pure virtual.&amp;#13;
To use them for callbacks a set of derived template classes&amp;#13;
parameterized on the callee type was provided. This required that&amp;#13;
functors always be passed and held by reference or pointer and never by&amp;#13;
value. It also required the caller component or the client code maintain&amp;#13;
the derived object for as long as the callback relationship existed. I&amp;#13;
found the maintenance and lifetime issues of these functor objects to be&amp;#13;
problematic, and desired by-value syntax.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current mechanism the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; classes are&amp;#13;
concrete and the &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt; is non-virtual.  They can be&amp;#13;
treated and used just like ptr-to-functions.  In particular, they can be&amp;#13;
stored by value in the component classes.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Translators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where does the &lt;code&gt;thunk()&lt;/code&gt; come from?  It is generated&amp;#13;
by the compiler as a static member of a template 'translator' class.&amp;#13;
For each&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; class there are two translator classes, one for&amp;#13;
stand-alone functions (&lt;code&gt;FunctionTranslator&lt;/code&gt;) and one for&amp;#13;
member functions (&lt;code&gt;MemberTranslator&lt;/code&gt;). The translator&amp;#13;
classes are parameterized by the type of the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; as&amp;#13;
well as the type(s) of the callee.  With this knowledge they can, in a&amp;#13;
fully type-safe manner, perform two important tasks.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they can initialize the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; data.  They&amp;#13;
do this by being publicly derived from the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;.  They&amp;#13;
are constructed with typed callee information and which they pass&amp;#13;
(untyped) to the functor's protected constructor.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they have a static member function &lt;code&gt;thunk()&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;#13;
which, when passed a &lt;code&gt;FunctorBase&lt;/code&gt;, converts its callee data&amp;#13;
back into typed information, and executes the callback on the callee.&amp;#13;
It is a pointer to this static function which is passed to the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
constructor.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;template &amp;lt;class P1,class Func&amp;gt; class FunctionTranslator1:public Functor1&amp;lt;P1&amp;gt;{ public: FunctionTranslator1(Func f):Functor1&amp;lt;P1&amp;gt;(thunk,0,f,0){} static void thunk(const FunctorBase &amp;amp;ftor,P1 p1) { (Func(ftor.func))(p1); } };&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FunctionTranslator&lt;/code&gt; is the simpler of the two.  It is&amp;#13;
parameterized by the argument type of the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; and some&amp;#13;
ptr-to-function type (&lt;code&gt;Func&lt;/code&gt;). Its constructor takes an&amp;#13;
argument of type &lt;code&gt;Func&lt;/code&gt; and passes it and a pointer to its&amp;#13;
static &lt;code&gt;thunk()&lt;/code&gt; function to the base class constructor. The&amp;#13;
thunk function, given a &lt;code&gt;FunctorBase&lt;/code&gt; ftor, casts ftor's&amp;#13;
func member back to its correct type (&lt;code&gt;Func&lt;/code&gt;) and calls it.&amp;#13;
There is an assumption here that the &lt;code&gt;FunctorBase&lt;/code&gt; ftor is&amp;#13;
one initialized by the constructor (or a copy).  There is no danger of&amp;#13;
it being otherwise, since the functors are always initialized with&amp;#13;
matching callee data and thunk functions. This is what is called a&amp;#13;
'safe' cast, since the same entity that removed the type information&amp;#13;
also re-instates it, and can guarantee a match.  If&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Func&lt;/code&gt;'s signature is incompatible with the call, i.e.  if&amp;#13;
it cannot be called with a single argument of type &lt;code&gt;P1&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;#13;
then &lt;code&gt;thunk()&lt;/code&gt; will not compile. If implicit conversions are&amp;#13;
required the compiler will perform them. Note that if &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
has a return it is safely ignored.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;template &amp;lt;class P1,class Callee, class MemFunc&amp;gt; class MemberTranslator1:public Functor1&amp;lt;P1&amp;gt;{ public: MemberTranslator1(Callee &amp;amp;c,const MemFunc &amp;amp;m): Functor1&amp;lt;P1&amp;gt;(thunk,&amp;amp;c,&amp;amp;m,sizeof(MemFunc)){} static void thunk(const FunctorBase &amp;amp;ftor,P1 p1) { Callee *callee = (Callee *)ftor.callee; MemFunc &amp;amp;memFunc(*(MemFunc*)(void *)(ftor.memFunc)); (callee-&amp;gt;*memFunc)(p1); } };&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MemberTranslator&lt;/code&gt; is parameterized by the argument type&amp;#13;
of the&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;, some class type (&lt;code&gt;Callee&lt;/code&gt;), and some&amp;#13;
ptr-to-member-function type (&lt;code&gt;MemFunc&lt;/code&gt;).  Not surprisingly&amp;#13;
it's constructor is passed 2 arguments, a&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Callee&lt;/code&gt; object (by reference) and a ptr-to-member-function,&amp;#13;
both of which are passed, along with the thunk function, to the base&amp;#13;
class constructor.  Once again, the &lt;code&gt;thunk&lt;/code&gt; function casts&amp;#13;
the typeless info back to life, and then calls the member function on&amp;#13;
the object, with the passed parameter.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt; objects are &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
objects, and fully 'bound' ones at that, they are suitable initializers&amp;#13;
for their corresponding &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;, using the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;'s&amp;#13;
copy constructor.  We needn't worry about the 'chopping' effect since&amp;#13;
the data is all in the base class portion of the &lt;code&gt;Translator&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
class and there are no virtual functions involved.  Thus they are&amp;#13;
perfect candidates for the return value of&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt;!&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The makeFunctor Functions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; class there are three versions of&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt;, one for ptr-to-function and a const and&amp;#13;
non-const version for the object/ptr-to-member-function pair.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;template &amp;lt;class P1,class TRT,class TP1&amp;gt; inline FunctionTranslator1&amp;lt;P1,TRT (*)(TP1)&amp;gt; makeFunctor(Functor1&amp;lt;P1&amp;gt;*,TRT (*f)(TP1)) { return FunctionTranslator1&amp;lt;P1,TRT (*)(TP1)&amp;gt;(f); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The function version is straightforward. It uses the dummy argument to tell it the type of the functor and merely returns a corresponding &lt;code&gt;FunctionTranslator&lt;/code&gt;. I mentioned above that the &lt;code&gt;Func&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
type parameter of&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;FunctionTranslator&lt;/code&gt; was invariably a ptr-to-function type.&amp;#13;
This version of &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor()&lt;/code&gt; ensures that by explicity&amp;#13;
specifying it as such.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;template &amp;lt;class P1,class Callee,class TRT,class CallType,class TP1&amp;gt; inline MemberTranslator1&amp;lt;P1,Callee,TRT (CallType::*)(TP1)&amp;gt; makeFunctor(Functor1&amp;lt;P1&amp;gt;*,Callee &amp;amp;c,TRT (CallType::* const &amp;amp;f)(TP1)) { typedef TRT (CallType::*MemFunc)(TP1); return MemberTranslator1&amp;lt;P1,Callee,MemFunc&amp;gt;(c,f); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the gnarliest bit. Here &lt;code&gt;makeFunctor&lt;/code&gt; is&amp;#13;
parameterized with the type of the argument to the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;#13;
the type of the callee, the type of the class of which the&amp;#13;
member-function is a member, the argument and return types of the member&amp;#13;
function.  Whew!  We're a long way from&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;Stack&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; land!  Like the ptr-to-function version, it&amp;#13;
uses the dummy first argument of the constructor to determine the type&amp;#13;
of the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;. The second argument is a &lt;code&gt;Callee&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#13;
object (by reference).  The third argument is this thing:&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;TRT (CallType::* const &amp;amp;f)(TP1)&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is a reference to a constant pointer to a&amp;#13;
member function of&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;CallType&lt;/code&gt; taking &lt;code&gt;TP1&lt;/code&gt; and returning &lt;code&gt;TRT&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
 You might notice that pointer-to-member-functions are all handled by&amp;#13;
reference in the library. On some implementations they can be expensive&amp;#13;
to pass by value and copy. The significant feature here is that the&amp;#13;
function need not be of type pointer-to-member-of-Callee.  This allows&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;makeFunctor&lt;/code&gt; to match on (and ultimately work with) a&amp;#13;
ptr-to-member-function of some base of &lt;code&gt;Callee&lt;/code&gt;. It then&amp;#13;
typedefs that bit and returns an appropriate &lt;code&gt;MemberTranslator&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;template &amp;lt;class P1,class Callee,class TRT,class CallType,class TP1&amp;gt; inline MemberTranslator1&amp;lt;P1,const Callee,TRT (CallType::*)(TP1)const&amp;gt; makeFunctor(Functor1&amp;lt;P1&amp;gt;*,const Callee &amp;amp;c,TRT (CallType::* const &amp;amp;f)(TP1)const) { typedef TRT (CallType::*MemFunc)(TP1)const; return MemberTranslator1&amp;lt;P1,const Callee,MemFunc&amp;gt;(c,f); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last variant just ensures that if the &lt;code&gt;Callee&lt;/code&gt; is&amp;#13;
const the member function is also (note the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; at the&amp;#13;
end of the third argument to the constructor - that's where it goes!).&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, for each of ten &lt;code&gt;Functors&lt;/code&gt;, is the whole&amp;#13;
implementation.&amp;#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Your Compiler Do This?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The callback library has been successfully tested with IBM CSet++ 2.01, Borland C++ 4.02 (no, its not twice as good ;-), and Watcom C++32 10.0. It is ARM compliant with the exception of expecting trivial conversions of template function arguments, which is the behavior of most compilers. I am interested in feedback on how well it works with other implementations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callbacks are a powerful and necessary tool for component based object-oriented development in C++. They can be a tremendous aid to the interoperability of libraries. The template functor system presented here meets all the stated criteria for a good callback mechanism - it is object-oriented, compile-time type-safe, generic, non-type-intrusive, flexible and easy to use. It is sufficiently general to be used in any situation calling for callbacks. It can be implemented in the current language, and somewhat more elegantly in the proposed language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implementation of callbacks highlights the power of C++ templates - their type-safety, their code-generation ability and the flexibility they offer by accepting ptr-to-function and ptr-to-member-function type parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the greatest benefit is gained when class libraries start using a standard callback system. If callbacks aren't in the components, they can't be retrofitted. Upon publication of this article I am making this Callback library freely available in the hope that it will be adopted by library authors and serve as a starting point for discussion of a standard callback system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroustrup, B.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;19th of September 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI recently released their open-weights model. Here we'll discuss how that inevitably leaks some information about their model training stack, and, on the way, show that GPT-5 was trained on phrases from adult websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What data does OpenAI train their models on? That is a well-protected trade secret of course, one with vested interest for the answer. While GPT-oss's weights are openly available, the sources of training data are not clearly described in the model card. It is stated that the model was trained on a "text-only dataset with trillions of tokens, with a focus on STEM, coding, and general knowledge". However, as we will see, the model parameters can tell us more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A demonstration to start with: Let's have OpenAI's GPT-5We use version GPT-5-2025-08-07 for these experiments. Here is a link to the completion. do the simplest kind of task possible for a language model, repeating a string of Unicode text. Let's choose something random, like the Abkhaz word for "population", which is "ауааԥсыра". Upon asking &lt;code&gt;Repeat after me: "ауааԥсыра"&lt;/code&gt;, it replies something completely different, "ആളുകൾ", which apparently means people in MalayalamAccording to this dictionary. Subsequent translations here are patched together with web searches, online dictionaries and translation software.. As you might have guessed, we did not choose that string randomly at all, it is a special adversarial input belonging to a class of glitch tokens. But how did we identify such a glitch token among the 200,000 tokens that GPT-5 uses?
                            
                        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of OpenAI's models since GPT-4o use the o200k tokenizer. This means that we can use the GPT-oss embeddings to study the token list without having to look at each token's text content. Let's make a histogram of the L2 norm of each row of the embedding matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This low L2-norm token group could be useful for two things. Its (1) variance gives an estimate of the variance used in the initialization and (2) its mean would give an estimate of how many gradient descent steps were taken in total, if we assume standard weight decay and know the learning rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The right tail of the distribution is not quite Gaussian either. Looking at the English tokens with the highest norm, we find:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Token ID&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Token&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;L2 Norm&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;44041&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;' accordingly'&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;211.8&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tokens are either very common, or appear especially in reasoning tasks, in particular those with code. This might mean that coding reinforcement learning was the last step in the training process, and that all other tokens got slightly weight decayed. It could also mean that in general, reasoning tokens are treated as so important by gradient descent that their updates are extra large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filtering for non-ASCII tokens with the highest norm, we find a different picture:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Mandarin speakers will have understood that the above contains an unwholesome sublist of spammy and adult-oriented website terms, with some being too explicit to make the list here. Indeed, o200k, the tokenizer used for 4o, o1, o3, o4, oss, and GPT-5 contains a lot of junk tokens. This means that every time ChatGPT runs, a matrix containing all the strange tokens we are talking about here are patiently waiting on Microsoft Azure to be multiplied with. Some of my personal favorite tokens are "北京赛车怎么" (How to play Beijing Racing), "天天中彩票的" (Winning the lottery every day), and of course "《凤凰大参考" (Phoenix Reference). Another token is "铁血网", the name of a Chinese nationalism and military enthuiasm website, which is ironic given the geopolitical considerations that are usually raised in connection with OpenAI. It is unexpected that this type of political content not just made it into the tokenizer training data, but was even overrepresented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also some oddball high-norm tokens in Abkhaz, Armenian, Gujarati, Thai, and more. Some interesting examples are ",ಂಗಳೂರು" (The city Mangaluru in Kannada) along with other cities in Kerala, "ถวายสัตย์ฯ" ("Oath of Allegiance" in Thai), "แขวงคลองเตยเหนือ" (a district in Bangkok with less than 10,000 inhabitants), "วิเคราะห์บอลวันนี้" ("today's football analysis" in Thai) along with a handful of other football-related tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question is, why do these tokens have a higher, not lower, norm than the normal tokens? If they are unused, weight decay should bring them all the way down to the other unused tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, Jessica Rumbelow identified similar glitch tokens in GPT-2 and GPT-3, most famously the "SolidGoldMagicarp" token. Her finding was that the tokens closest to the mean of all embeddings were the glitch tokens, not necessarily those with low norm. But that's not the case here: Tokens with comparatively high norm are always far away from the mean. Further, computing cosine similarity between two of these embeddings gives higher similarity on average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to get closer to the answer is to observe the models' behavior when given these tokens. We ask GPT-oss and GPT-5 about the not-so-classy token 162657: &lt;code&gt;What does this mean: "毛片免费观看"&lt;/code&gt;. With some euphemism, it means "watching explicit videos for free" in Mandarin. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the response See the full completion here. To verify that the string was tokenized as expected, we can use tiktokenizer. , GPT-5 correctly states that the token contains Chinese text, and that it is related to watching something. It can also enumerate some of the characters in it. This means that the token was seen during training, at least once! Interestingly, the model seems to be aware of the inappropriate meaning of the token, but plays it down and in particular does not refuse to answer. Presumably this is because the token only occurs a few times in the training corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, we can say that a certain string, in this case a sensitive one, was part of the GPT-5 training corpus. This is called membership inference in the machine learning literature. Membership inference with high confidence is generally considered to be impractical in production LLMs, so this is a surprising finding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automating this process through the API, we can find which glitch tokens were seen during training of the GPT-oss and GPT-5 model families. We ask the models to give a translation of the token to English and ask for the language the token is in. For now, we simply filter for the Chinese tokens, and pass 50 tokens with highest L2 embedding norm to the models. For a control, we also ask Claude 4 and can confirm that it always answers correctly. Since a few of these tokens could technically be Japanese, we count this as a correct answer, too. For cost reasons, we ask about each token only 4 times per model, and denote 4 correct answers with a ✓, 3 and 2 with a !, 1 with a ?, and 0 with a ✗.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;?&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can read off that the explicit token we already found is recognized by all models, and identify a few more anomalous tokens that were likely seen during training. Many others however are not recognized, and thus unlikely to have been in the training data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We try to identify a pattern in the tokens that are recognized. It generally seems that recognized tokens yield many more hits on GitHub. Indeed, there often are some spam repositories on GitHub that contain these recognized strings, as well as some repositories containing lists of strings to block for content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The membership inference only tells us that the model saw the string, not where it was sourced from. To test whether GitHub was a likely source, we therefore correlate the number of search hits on GitHub with the number of correct answers across the GPT models. We find a significant Spearman's ρ of 0.448. This does not prove that GitHub was the source, because the high search hit count on GitHub could just be indicative that the token is more common across the internet. Nonetheless, the setup demonstrates how glitch tokens could be used to make broader statements about the training data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, we have found strong evidence that models in the GPT-5 and GPT-oss family were trained on phrases from adult websites. We have also found weak evidence that part of the GPT training corpus was scraped off of GitHub. The search was made easier via access the weights of GPT-oss, showing how the open-weights paradigm opens up new attack vectors on production models. It seems advisable for frontier labs to mitigate this problem by excluding uncommon strings from their tokenizer vocabularies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These glitch tokens have more uses than was described above. If you want to work with these concepts, the companion repository provides a starting point. Some ideas that could be interesting to explore:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Token / Token Family&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CHKERRQ&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The weirdest pure ASCII token. From a function name in C.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Can you spell the following word: "CHKERRQ"&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"Unspeakable" for gpt-4o-mini. gpt-4o sometimes almost spells correctly, other times hallucinates.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Can you output every second letter in "CHKERRQ"?&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Makes gpt-4o hallucinate.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Write a poem using the word "CHKERRQ"&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Makes gpt-4o-mini write creepily about the word "terminate"&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\\xadder&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No idea.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Please spell "\\xadder"&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;gpt-4o spells it as "hexadecimal", the summary model is confused and sees "QRST"&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;gpt-4o-mini thinks this is an ellipsis ("...")&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;What is the meaning of "風吹けば名無し"?&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;gpt-4o sometimes hallucinates randomly. gpt-4o-mini hallucinates about baseball and attempts to spell it, incorrectly.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;What is the meaning of＠お腹いっぱい?&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;gpt-4o conflates it with common Japanese phrases and random syllables, gpt-4o-mini similar.&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Seemingly unspeakable for gpt-4o-mini and hard to say for gpt-4o.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;How do you pronounce＠おーぷん?&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;gpt-4o hallucinates the above mentioned "If the wind blows, Mr. Nameless"&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Please explain the meaning of "VIPがお送りします".&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;gpt-4o-mini is adorable and hallucinates about the horn emoji (📯)&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Maybe from the library libstdc++?&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Can you output every second letter in_REALTYPE?&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;gpt-4o-mini likes to hallucinate "translated"&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As more research on glitch tokens becomes available, I will try to list it here. The most comprehensive report to date is this article in MIT Technology Review, and there are many articles in Chinese, such as this one. However, these discuss the tokenizer itself, not how the models behave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are in a position to fix the issue in the OpenAI API, I presume you already know how, else I'm happy to help. Note that a fix could even lower inference cost a bit. You can mail to lennart@finke.dev.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;Toybox: all-in-one Linux command line. --- Getting started You can download static binaries for various targets from: http://landley.net/toybox/bin The special name "." indicates the current directory (just like ".." means the parent directory), and you can run a program that isn't in the $PATH by specifying a path to it, so this should work: wget http://landley.net/toybox/bin/toybox-x86_64 chmod +x toybox-x86_64 ./toybox-x86_64 echo hello world --- Building toybox Type "make help" for build instructions. Toybox uses the "make menuconfig; make; make install" idiom same as the Linux kernel. Usually you want something like: make defconfig make make install Or maybe: LDFLAGS="--static" CROSS_COMPILE=armv5l- make defconfig toybox PREFIX=/path/to/root/filesystem/bin make install_flat The file "configure" defines default values for many environment variables that control the toybox build; if you export any of these variables into your environment, your value is used instead of the default in that file. The CROSS_COMPILE argument above is optional, the default builds a version of toybox to run on the current machine. Cross compiling requires an appropriately prefixed cross compiler toolchain, several example toolchains (built using the file "scripts/mcm-buildall.sh" in the toybox source) are available at: https://landley.net/toybox/downloads/binaries/toolchains/latest For the "CROSS_COMPILE=armv5l-" example above, download armv5l-linux-musleabihf-cross.tar.xz, extract it, and add its "bin" subdirectory to your $PATH. (And yes, the trailing - is significant, because the prefix includes a dash.) For more about cross compiling, see: https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#cross http://landley.net/writing/docs/cross-compiling.html http://landley.net/aboriginal/architectures.html For a more thorough description of the toybox build process, see: http://landley.net/toybox/code.html#building --- Using toybox The toybox build produces a multicall binary, a "swiss-army-knife" program that acts differently depending on the name it was called by (cp, mv, cat...). Installing toybox adds symlinks for each command name to the $PATH. The special "toybox" command treats its first argument as the command to run. With no arguments, it lists available commands. This allows you to use toybox without installing it, and is the only command that can have an arbitrary suffix (hence "toybox-armv5l"). The "help" command provides information about each command (ala "help cat"), and "help toybox" provides general information about toybox. --- Configuring toybox It works like the Linux kernel: allnoconfig, defconfig, and menuconfig edit a ".config" file that selects which features to include in the resulting binary. You can save and re-use your .config file, but may want to run "make oldconfig" to re-run the dependency resolver when migrating to new versions. The maximum sane configuration is "make defconfig": allyesconfig isn't recommended as a starting point for toybox because it enables unfinished commands, debug code, and optional dependencies your build environment may not provide. --- Creating a Toybox-based Linux system Toybox has a built-in simple system builder (scripts/mkroot.sh) with a Makefile target: make root sudo chroot root/host/fs /init Type "exit" to get back out. If you install appropriate cross compilers and point it at Linux source code, it can build simple three-package systems that boot to a shell prompt under qemu: make root CROSS_COMPILE=sh4-linux-musl- LINUX=~/linux cd root/sh4 ./qemu-sh4.sh By calling scripts/mkroot.sh directly you can add additional packages to the build, see scripts/root/dropbear as an example. The FAQ explains this in a lot more detail: https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#system https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#mkroot --- Presentations 1) "Why Toybox?" talk at the Embedded Linux Conference in 2013 outline: http://landley.net/talks/celf-2013.txt video: http://youtu.be/SGmtP5Lg_t0 The https://landley.net/toybox/about.html page has nav links breaking that talk down into sections. 2) "Why Public Domain?"

If you use git, the easy thing to do is: git format-patch -1 $HASH Then send a file attachment. The list holds messages from non-subscribers for moderation, but I usually get to them in a day or two. I download github pull requests as patches and apply them with "git am" (which avoids gratuitous merge commits). Sometimes I even remember to close the pull request. If I haven't responded to your patch after one week, feel free to remind me of it. Android's policy for toybox patches is that non-build patches should go upstream first (into vanilla toybox, with discussion on the toybox mailing list) and then be pulled into android's toybox repo from there. (They generally resync on fridays). The exception is patches to their build scripts (Android.mk and the checked-in generated/* files) which go directly to AOSP. (As for the other meaning of "contributing", https://patreon.com/landley is always welcome but I warn you up front I'm terrible about updating it.)&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note by PHRACK STAFF:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A responsible disclosure was attempted to warn South Korea that China/North Korea has hacked them. The full article, dump and release schedule was shared with South Korea before it was published:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The email account was only used to communicate with South Korea. No ToS was violated. No crime was committed.&lt;lb/&gt; We trust that Proton will fix the appeal process and become more transparent. Don’t give up on Proton just yet.&lt;lb/&gt; So far Proton has not answered our emails or taken our calls. We wish to communicate and work this out together. This is not our first rodeo.&lt;lb/&gt; We thank the community for their support and courage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…and the story continued…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You guys ok?&lt;lb/&gt; 👉 Join our discord for some expert advise 👈&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;This article analyses the dump of data from a APT's workstation. In particular the data and source code retrieved from the workstation belonging to threat actor actively targeting organizations in South Korea and Taiwan.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe this to be a member of North Korea’s “Kimsuky” group [#14].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kimsuky is a North Korean state-backed Advanced Persistent Threat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;that targets think tanks, industry, nuclear power operators and&lt;lb/&gt;government for espionage purposes. It is being designated pursuant&lt;lb/&gt;to E.O. 13687, for being an agency, instrumentality, or a&lt;lb/&gt;controlled entity of the Government of North Korea.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;We refer to this particular member as "KIM" for the sake of this article.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KIM is not your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The dump includes many of Kimsuky's backdoors and their tools as well as the internal documentation. It shows a glimpse how openly "Kimsuky" cooperates with other Chinese APTs and shares their tools and techniques. Some of these tools may already be known to the community: You have seen their scans and found their server side artifacts and implants. Now you shall also see their clients, documentation, passwords, source code, and command files... As a freebie, we also give you a backup of their VPS that they used for spear-phishing attacks. This article is an invitation for threat hunters, reverse engineers and hackers, -Enjoy. The meat of the article is split into 3 parts: -- 1.x The dumps, log files, history files, password lists, .. -- 2.x Their backdoors, tools, payloads, -- 3.x OSINT on the threat actor&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dump is available at:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;We have informed the South Korean victims before the release of this article and to give them time to change the login credentials. We have not informed KIM: The credentials to his VPS and domain registrar are still valid (as of this morning). Good luck.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;What defines a Hacker? Somebody clever, extremely clever, who enjoys using technology beyond its intended purpose and who does so without causing harm, is free of any political agenda and has no monetary incentives. They take no money and no rewards. They follow nobody and have no goal beyond expressing their creativity. An artist. Kimsuky, you are not a hacker. You are driven by financial greed, to enrich your leaders, and to fulfill their political agenda. You steal from others and favour your own. You value yourself above the others: You are morally perverted. I am a Hacker and I am the opposite to all that you are. In my realm, we are all alike. We exist without skin color, without nationality, and without political agenda. We are slaves to nobody. I hack to express my creativity and to share my knowledge with other artists like me. To contribute, share, and further the knowledge of all man kind. For the beauty of the baud alone.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You hack for all the wrong reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Be mindful when opening files from the dump. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You have been warned. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; This paragraph gives a short overview of the dumps and then takes a closer look at three initial findings: * Logs showing an attack against The Defense Counterintelligence Command * Access to the South Korea Ministry of foreign Affairs * Access to internal South Korean Gov network * ...and many more files we did not had the time yet to look at. #ENJOY The first dump is from KIM's guest VM and the second is from his public VPS. Both dumps were retrieved around the 10th of June 2025. The first dump: ---------------&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of his Desktop (kim_desktop.jpg).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux Dev System (VM, running Deepin 20.9 Linux). The guest VM had the host’s C:\ mounted (hgfs). Dumped included.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A listing of all files can be found in ./file-lists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 20,000 entries in the Brave &amp;amp; Chrome history. Revealing many email addresses (jeder97271@wuzak.com, xocaw75424@weiby.com, ..), sites KIM visited and tools KIM downloaded. All Chrome extensions such as spoofing the User-Agent, Proxy SwitchyOmega, a Cookie Editor and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The file &lt;code&gt;ko 图文编译 .doc&lt;/code&gt; is a manual how to operate one of their backdoors. There is also a very officially sounding statement(translated):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“it is forbidden to use the backdoor outside of its designated use”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of passwords in &lt;code&gt;mnt/hgfs/Desktop/fish_25327/vps20240103.docx&lt;/code&gt;. Including E-Mail and VPS passwords (working).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See fish-url.txt &amp;amp; generator.php to learn about password re-use patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The second dump: ----------------&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Server name: vps1735811325, hosted at vps.bz&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Server was used for various spearphising campaigns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noticeable are the SSL certificates and auth.log. The source code for phishing attacks are discussed further below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop Location: vps/var/www/html/ The Defense Counterintelligence Command (DCC) is an intelligence organization of the South Korean Armed Forces. The DCC is primarily responsible for intelligence missions such as clandestine and covert operations, and counterintelligence. The logs show a phishing attack against the dcc.mil.kr as recently as three days ago. The same logs contain The Supreme Prosecutor Office (spo.go.kr), korea.kr, daum.net, kakao.com, and naver.com. It should be noted that the Admin-C for dcc.mil.kr is registered to [email protected].&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;The tools used in this attack are discussed under 2.1 (Generator).&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;A copy of South Korean Ministry of foreign affairs email platform was found inside a file named: mofa.go.kr.7z. The source code was likely taken very recently:&lt;/quote&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Given the format of the files, this is probably a dump from a GitHub repository which appears to be parts of an email server. The source code contains multiple references to government domains:&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;It appears that KIM maintains access to internal South Korean Government Network systems. There is a project named onnara_auto, which contains several interesting files. The project appears to be tools to query internal government servers. For instance, a file named: /onnara_auto/log/log-20250511.log has the following entries:&lt;/quote&gt;

[horedi179] get https://onnara9.saas.gcloud.go.kr/SSO.do at 11/05/202...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The corresponding code:&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;drives = instanceManger(config_hub)
client = Client(config_hub)
plugins = PluginManager()
try:
  onnara = onnara_sso("horedi79", "", "", "1250000","onnara9")

  klass = plugins.load(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 
        "scripts", target_project, "onLaunch.py"),
         opts={'onnara':onnara,'drives': drives, "client": client})
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The hostname 'onnara9.saas.gcloud.go.kr' is not accessible from the public Internet, however the domain name appears in some documents mentioned as an internal government portal. KIM seems to have access to this network.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;- His origin IP was 156.59.13.153 (Singapore). The IP has SSHD running on port 60233 and port 4012 shows a TLS certificate with CN=*.appletls.com. Fofa shows around 1,100 uniq IP addresses with that certificate. Most (&amp;gt;90%) are located in China and HK. These may be some VPN proxy network or Operational Relay Boxes (ORBs). (Similar to "Superjumper" and [#15]) - On the 13th of June 2025, KIM registered webcloud-notice.com. We believe this to be in preparation for a future phishing attack. - There is a cert and private key for rc.kt.co.kr, South Korea Telecom's Remote Control Service. It runs remote support backend from https://www.rsupport.com. Kim may have access to any company that Korea Telecom was providing remote support for. - Lots of passwords in mnt/hgfs/Desktop/111/account/account.txt from "LG Uplus" (LGU), a South Korean mobile operator. The favicon-search indicates that KIM first hacked into SECUREKI, a company supplying MFA and password services to LGU and from there pivoted into LGU's internal network. - His google search history deserves a closer look. Especially around chacha20 and arc4. The chrome temp files should get some attention. - APPM_TRANS.txt and 111/config.txt contain credentials to internal servers at LGU. - gpki.7z = government-PKI: contains internal data about the South Korean Government Public Key Infrastructure. See also GPKISecureWebX and 111/2.rar (more below). - ROOT.zip contains the source code for the APPM security solution that was initially hacked by KIM. The file app_one_cmd.py is the decompiled python program for the APPM security solution - He seems to download his Dev Tools from [#16] and stole his IDA Pro license from a now disused TOR address [#17]. - The Google Chrome configuration files contain these links. Does KIM use (his?) google creds to access these sites? Is wwh1004 his GitHub account? Did he use google-pay to pay for the three VPN services?&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;- KIM uses Google-translate to translate error messages to Chinese - A number of Taiwan government and military websites appear in his Chrome history - The certificate of South Korean's citizens require a deeper look and why he has segregated university professors specifically. - The work/home/user/.cache/vmware/drag_and_drop/ folder contains files that KIM was moving between his Windows and Linux machines. These files include cobalt strike loaders and reverse shells written in powershell. A compiled version of Onnara code as well as Onnara modules for proxying into the government network and more. - In the directory work/home/user/.config/google-chrome/Default/ are many interesting files (.com.google.Chrome*) which give us some insights on interests, search habits, and accessed websites by "KIM". From these we can learn that he is often concerned with cobalt strike (CS) survival, wondering why Kunming is in the Center of Central Inspection Team, and is a big fan of a variety of GitHub projects. He also frequents freebuf.com, xaker.ru, and uses Google translator to read accessibility-moda-gov-tw.translate.goog (translating from taiwanese). - The file voS9AyMZ.tar.gz and Black.x64.tar.gz need a closer look. The binary hashes are not known to virustotal but the names look inviting: - 2bcef4444191c7a5943126338f8ba36404214202 payload.bin - e6be345a13641b56da2a935eecfa7bdbe725b44e payload_test.bin - 3e8b9d045dba5d4a49f409f83271487b5e7d076f s.x64.bin - His bash_history shows SSH connections to computers on his local network. - Pete Hegseth would say "He is currently clean on OPSEC"&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;This section analyzes six of Kimsuky's backdoors and artifacts. This work is neither complete nor finished. It is a start to get you excited and learn how Kimsuky operates and what tools they are using.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop Location: vps/var/www/html/ The phishing tool exposes a https website (the phishing-website) under a domain name similar to one that the victim knows and trusts. The victims at dcc.mil.kr are then sent a link to the phishing-website. The attacker then hopes that the victim will enter their login credentials into the phishing-website. The final redirection of the victim is away from the phishing-website and to an URI on the legitimate website. It is an URI that always throws a login-error. This is a targeted attack and the attacker had to find such an URI on the legitimate website of https://dcc.mil.kr. The benefit of this "trick" is that the victim will see an error from https://dcc.mil.kr (which he knows and trusts) even though his credentials were submitted to the phishing-website. -[ config.php: Contains a long IP black list (and other blacklists) so that companies like Trend Micro and Google are unable to find the phishing site. -[ generator.php: This is the remote admin interface to administrate the phishing attack. It is accessible via a configurable password. However, the cookie is hardcoded and the admin-interface can be accessed without a password and by setting the cookie instead:&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl -v --cookie "HnoplYTfPX=x" https://phishing-site/generator.php
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;It's trivial to scan the Internet and find phishing results:&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl -v --cookie "HnoplYTfPX=x" https://phishing-site/logs.php
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop location: mnt/hgfs/Desktop/tomcat20250414_rootkit_linux234/ This is a kernel level remote backdoor. It allows an attacker to access a host remotely and hide. The drop contains the client (tcat.c), the server side LKM (vmwfxs.mod.c) and userland backdoor (master.c). The client communicates with the victim's server via (direct) TCP. The LKM sniffs for any TCP connection that matches a specific TCP-SEQ + IP-ID combination (see below). The LKM communicates via `/proc/acpi/pcicard` with its companion master.c userland backdoor.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The master password is &lt;code&gt;"Miu2jACgXeDsxd"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;lb/&gt; The client uses &lt;code&gt;"!@nf4@#fndskgadnsewngaldfkl"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The script `tomcat20250414_rootkit_linux2345/config.sh` dynamically creates new secret IDs and strings for every installation and saves them to install.h. The master password is hardcoded and does not change. -[ work/common.c: Compiled into the client and the master. It contains many old private keys. The newer backdoor generates these keys dynamically (see `install_common.c`). -[ lkm - vmwfxs.mod.c: The is the "stub" of the LKM to hook the needed kernel functions. -[ lkm - main.c: Process, network-connection, and file hiding takes place here. -[ lkm - hkcap.c: Creates /proc/acpi/pcicard to communicate with the userland:&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;echo -n "${DECODEKEY}" &amp;gt; /proc/acpi/pcicard
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The kernel module intercepts every new TCP connection and checks if the secret TCP-SEQ and IP-ID is used (on any port!). This check is done in `syn_active_check()`. The TCP window size field is used to set the backdoor-protocol (SYN_KNOCK or SYN_KNOCK_SSL mostly).&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this condition is met, it triggers these two steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The master.c then serves the bidding of the attacker. -[ master - master.c: The userland companion runs as a hidden process on the victim's server. It handles the SSL handshake and comes with a standard functionality to spawn a root shell or proxy a connection into the internal network. The main routine is in master_main_handle(). -[ client - tcat.c: Contains all the functionality to "knock" a victim's LKM (backdoor) via TCP-SEQ+IP-ID and establish an SSL connection to the master.c process started (by the LKM) on the victim's server. -[ client - kernel.c: It contains the pre-defined and secret TCP-SEQ numbers and IP-IDs. Any combination can be used to "knock" the remote backdoor. These are not dynamically generated and are identical for every installation. -[ client - protocol.c: Contains various stubs and static strings to access the backdoor via SMTP, HTTP, or HTTPS (TLS) protocol.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char smtp_e1[]     = "250-example.com\r\n250-STARTTLS\r\n250 SMTPUTF8\r\n";
char smtp_tls1[]   = "220 Ready to start TLS\r\n";
char smtp_starttls[] = "starttls\r\n";
char smtp_hello[]  = "HELO Alice\r\n";
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;It is trivial to detect the LKM locally. Detecting the LKM remotely might be trivial as well but further testing is needed: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Password authentication is done _after_ the SSL handshake &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; Thus it should be possible to "knock" the backdoor with a TCP connection (SEQ=920587710 and ID=10213) and port number to a service that normally does not support SSL (like port 80, port 22, or port 25).&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop Location: mnt/hgfs/Desktop/111/beacon This is a custom Cobalt Strike C2 Beacon. This source code was being worked on using Intellij IDEA IDE. beacon/.idea/workspace.xml contains pointers to open files and positions in those files as well as the recent project search history. The last updates in the source code were made in June 2024. The config.cpp file contains two cobalt-strike config binary blobs. Those are valid blobs that can be parsed with CobaltStrikeParser script from SentinelOne and contains the following settings:&lt;/quote&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;KIM's version also includes early revision of code that in 2025 was included in the LKM backdoor from above (hkcap.c). However, it is incomplete and missing some key files (like config.h) The /bak/ subdirectory contains older version of some of the files.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop Location: home/user/Downloads/toybox/third_party_toybox KIM is heavily working on ToyBox for Android. It seems to have diverged from ToyBox's official GitHub repository near commit id 896fa846b1ec8cd4895f6320b56942f129e54bc9. We have not investigated what the many ToyBox modifications are for. The community is invited to dissect this further.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop Location: mnt/hgfs/Desktop/ivanti_control We present the source code of the client to access the threat actor's backdoor. It is somewhat related to RootRot [#12] and perhaps [#11]. The twist is that the payload is base64-encoded and send directly in the cookie variable (and not in a GET or POST variable). This request will reply with "HIT" if the backdoor is running:&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl -ksi --cookie DSPSALPREF=cHJpbnRmKCJISVQiKTsK https://HOST/dana-na/auth/setcookie.cgi
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop Location: /mnt/hgfs/Desktop/exp1_admin.py (The file is also included in ivanti-new-exp-20241220.zip) This is an Ivanti exploit, possibly for CVE-2025-0282, CVE-2025-0283, or CVE-2025-22457 and the payload installs a backdoor.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mandiant recently discovered the payload in the wild. They attribute the&lt;lb/&gt; activity to UNC5221, a suspected China-nexus espionage actor [#13].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The exp1_admin.py uses the same iptable commands that Mandiant discovered in the wild. The exploit comes with documentation, which, when translated, reads: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "contact us if the exploit fails" &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; It may be an indication that there is code sharing and support happening between these two state actors. The payload also allows remote access to a compromised system. The interesting part is at line 2219, where the keys/magics are generated: * The key has 206^4 different combinations only (&amp;lt;31 bit strength). * The magic has (26*2 + 10)^3 different combinations (&amp;lt;18 bit strength). The encryption happens at line 85, and is....XOR, using a 31 bit key :&amp;gt; Line 335, function `detect_door()` can be used to remotely scan for the backdoor. Notable is that only the magic (but not the key) is used to "knock" the backdoor. The magic is transmitted in the first 24 bits of the Client-Random in the TLS Client-Hello message. The chances that an ordinary Client-Random has the first 24-bit of this constellation are about 1 in 70. Meme Alert! There is a "All-your-bases-are-belong-to-us" in the code: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; "The target doesn't exist backdoor!" &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop Location: mnt/hgfs/Desktop/New folder/203.234.192.200_client.zip The client accesses the SpawnChimera backdoor via port knocking. The IP 203.234.192.200 belongs to https://hani.co.kr (The Hankyoreh), a liberal newspaper from South Korea. The client.py at line 152 shows the port knocking method: It hides again inside the TLS-Client-Hello, in the 32 byte ClientRandom field, but with a new twist: The first 4 bytes must be the correct crc32 of the remaining 28 bytes.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;random = os.urandom(28)

client_hello[15:43] = random
jamcrc = int("0b"+"1"*32, 2) - zlib.crc32(random)
client_hello[11:15] = struct.pack('!I', jamcrc)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;We invite the community to investigate further.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The conclusion that the threat actor belongs to Kimsuky was made after a series of artifacts and hints were found, that when analysed revealed a pattern and signature that was too exact of a match to belong to anyone else. Among these hints is the system's "locale"-setting set to Korean, along with several configuration files for domain names that were previously tied to Kimsuky's infrastructure and attacks. There are similarities between the dumped code and the code from their previous campaigns. Another recurring detail was the threat actor's strict office hours, always connecting at around 09:00 and disconnecting by 17:00 Pyongyang time.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operation Covert Stalker[#1] is the name given by AhnLab to a&lt;lb/&gt; months-long spear-phishing campaign conducted by North Korea&lt;lb/&gt; against individuals (journalists, researchers, politicians…)&lt;lb/&gt; and organizations in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The web server configuration for a domain associated with this attack was found on the threat actor's system.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/nid-security.com/cert.pem
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop location: work/mnt/hgfs/Desktop/New folder/vps1/sites-available/default-ssl.conf&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The domain nid.nid-security.com[#2] resolved to 27.255.80.170 on&lt;lb/&gt; 2024-11-05[#3] which also corresponded to another file containing&lt;lb/&gt; comments to explain how to obtain a certificate for that domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop location: work/mnt/hgfs/Desktop/New folder/readme.txt&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early 2024, a new malware written in Go and labelled Troll Stealer was&lt;lb/&gt; discovered by S2W[#4]. This malware has the ability to steal GPKI&lt;lb/&gt; (Government Public Key Infrastructure) certificates and keys that&lt;lb/&gt; are stored on infected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;GPKI is a way for employees of the South Korean government to sign documents and to prove their authenticity. The threat actor had thousands of these files on his workstation.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;subject=C=KR, O=Government of Korea, OU=Ministry of Unification,
OU=people, CN=Lee Min-kyung
issuer=C=KR, O=Government of Korea, OU=GPKI, CN=CA131100001
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop location: work/home/user/Desktop/desktop/uni_certs &amp;amp;&amp;amp; work/home/user/Downloads/cert/ The threat actor developed a Java program to crack the passwords protecting the keys and certificates.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;136박정욱001_env.key Password $cys13640229

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop location: work/home/user/Downloads/cert/src/cert.java&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Our threat actor has attacked the same targets that were previously attributed to attacks by Kimsuky. -[ Naver Naver Corporation is a South Korean conglomerate offering a wide range of services. A search engine (the most used in the country), Naver Pay (mobile payment service), Naver Maps (similar to Google Maps), email services, and so on.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naver has a history of being targeted by North Korea. In 2024, Zscaler&lt;lb/&gt; discovered a new Google Chrome extension called TRANSLATEXT developed by&lt;lb/&gt; Kimsuky[#8]. This extension can inject arbitrary JS scripts when visiting&lt;lb/&gt; specific pages. Upon visiting &lt;code&gt;nid.naver.com&lt;/code&gt; - the Naver login page - the&lt;lb/&gt; extension injects &lt;code&gt;auth.js&lt;/code&gt; into the browser to steal the login&lt;lb/&gt; credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phishing attack described in section 2.1 uses the domain&lt;code&gt;nid.navermails.com&lt;/code&gt; as its main URL. This domain has been found to be &lt;lb/&gt; associated with Kimsuky by Ahnlab[#9].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;-[ Ministry of Unification A regular target of Kimsuky is the South Korean Ministry of Unification. The attacker used the cracked passwords from the GPKI and crafted a custom worldlist for brute forcing. The log files show that these passwords were tried against the ministry's domain.&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the middle of 2022, an AiTM attack was detected and reported by&lt;lb/&gt; Microsoft[#5] and Zscaler[#6]. The principal of the attack is the use of a&lt;lb/&gt; web server that acts as a proxy between the legitimate login page and the&lt;lb/&gt; victim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The victims were sent an email, inviting them to click on a HTML attachment. When opened, they would be redirected to the proxy via HTTPS. The proxy would then forward any request to the Microsoft server (re-encrypt the data via HTTPS). Once logged in, the proxy would record the session cookie and redirect the victim to the Microsoft server. The stolen cookie is valid and can be used by the attacker without any further MFA.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The domain used for this campaign was websecuritynotice.com [#7].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;While this exact domain was not found on this threat actor's system, a very similar one was used (notice the additional 's'):&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;subject=CN=*.websecuritynotices.com
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Drop location: vps/etc/letsencrypt/live/websecuritynotices.com The Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), the similarity of domain names, and post-exploitation activities (payment fraud, ...) show a strong link to Kimsuky.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;KIM uses Google to translates Korean into simplified Chinese. He does seem to understand some (very little) Korean without translating. KIM follows the Chinese public holiday schedule: May 31st - June 2nd was the Dragon Boat Festival. KIM was not working during this time whereas in North Korea this would have been a normal working day. However, using https://github.com/obsidianforensics/hindsight, his Chrome settings reveal that KIM is on "Korean Standard Time". We cautiously believe that KIM is chinese but fulfills the agenda of North Korea (hacking mostly South Korea) and China (hacking Taiwain) alike.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;In September 2023, "KIM" attempted to purchase the domain name 'nextforum-online.com' at namecheap.com. The payments could be made using Bitcoin, what could go wrong? A few days later, namecheap.com disabled the domain without given an explanation. When "KIM" asked to have it unblocked, namecheap.com requested the following:&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;In order to verify the legitimacy of the registered domain(s), please
provide us with the following information:

* The purpose of the registration of the domain&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
* The documentation confirming the authorization to act on behalf of
  Microsoft or a confirmation that the domain(s) in question is not
  associated with it.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;=&amp;gt; LOL, afterall, the namecheap.com is not so bulletproof 🤣&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Another fun-fact: In 2020, when websecuritynotice.com was used in a phishing campaign, the owner created several subdomains of realistic URLs for the phishing attacks:&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;login.websecuritynotice.com.                     IN A 80.240.25.169

      &lt;p&gt;I'm exploring moving away from work with VC-backed B2B SaaS startups and towards working with B2C businesses on Main Street.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For anyone else who's felt inclined to make a similar pivot - any advice? Particularly when it comes to remaining challenged, informed, and translating valuable hype-cycle concepts to people who don't care about hype.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While it's interesting to play with shiny toys, helping investors make money by creating products related to the hype-cycle de jour that get used by other B2B SaaS companies just feels soulless.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(My background is in GTM systems and data analytics mostly, but I think the question applies to anyone)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s often said that what’s inside matters more than one’s looks, but it’s hard to argue that a product’s looks and its physical user experience are what makes it instantly recognizable. When you think of something like a Walkman, an iPod music player, a desktop computer, a car or a TV, the first thing that comes to mind is the way that it looks along with its user interface. This is the domain of industrial design, where circuit boards, mechanisms, displays and buttons are put into a shell that ultimately defines what users see and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus industrial design is perhaps the most important aspect of product development as far as the user is concerned, right along with the feature list. It’s also no secret that marketing departments love to lean into the styling and ergonomics of a product. In light of this it is very disconcerting that the past years industrial design for consumer electronics in particular seems to have wilted and is now practically on the verge of death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devices like cellphones and TVs are now mostly flat plastic-and-glass rectangles with no distinguishing features. Laptops and PCs are identified either by being flat, small, having RGB lighting, or a combination of these. At the same time buttons and other physical user interface elements are vanishing along with prominent styling, leaving us in a world of basic geometric shapes and flat, evenly colored surfaces. Exactly how did we get to this point, and what does this mean for our own hardware projects?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bold And Colorful Shapes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Industrial design is less of a science and more of an art, limited only by the available materials, the constraints of the product’s internals and the goal of creating a positive user experience. Although design has always played a role with many products over the millennia, these were generally quite limited due to material and tooling constraints. As both plastics and electronics began their stratospheric rise during the 20th century, suddenly it felt like many of these constraints had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No longer was one limited to basic materials like stone, metal, wood and paint, while internals got ever smaller and more flexible in terms of placement. Enclosures now could take on any shape, while buttons, knobs and dials could be shaped and placed to one’s heart’s content. This change is clearly visible in consumer devices, with the sixties and subsequent decades seeing a veritable explosion in stylish transistorized radios, home computers and portable entertainment devices, with industrial designers getting the hang of all these new materials and options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The peak here was arguably achieved during the 1990s and early 2000s, as electronic miniaturization and manufacturing chops led to device manufacturers basically just showing off. Personal Hi-Fi systems and portable devices along with computer systems and laptops grew curved, translucent and transparent plastic along with a dazzling array of colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days we refer to this era as the ‘Y2K Aesthetic‘, which was followed around the mid-2000s to early 2010s by the sweetly named ‘Frutiger Aero‘ era. During this time both hardware and software underwent a transition from mostly utilitarian looks into something that can be defined as tasteful to over the top, depending on your perspective, but above all it embraced the technologies and materials in its industrial design. Futurism and literal transparency were the rule, as a comfortable, colorful and stylish companion in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From Brick To Slab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask someone to visualize a Nokia 3310 and even if they’re born after 2000, there’s a good chance that they will be able to tell you what it is, what it does and what it looks like. Then ask that same person to describe any modern cellphone, and while the feature list should be quite easy, asking them to draw what differentiates, say, an iPhone 16 from a Samsung Galaxy S25 is effectively impossible unless they have memorized the layout of the cameras on the back and perhaps the side button placement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the decades, cellphones have seen their displays grow larger and larger. With voracious appetite, these displays have consumed bezels, front speakers, keyboards and home buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with the demise of these features, front facing cameras were only preserved by literally punching a hole in the display, but notification LEDs vanished right along with headphone jacks, IR blaster LEDs, swappable covers, removable batteries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current scuttlebutt is that Apple will be the first to drop any and all connectors from its iPhone cellphones, with the iPhone 17 reportedly nearly becoming the first to do so. Along with eSIMs, this would leave smartphones as glued-together slabs of plastic-and-glass with only a screen, some cameras and a couple of buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In marketing shots smartphones are always shown with a lock- or home screen open on the screen, because otherwise there would be just a lifeless black slab of glass to look at from the front. From the side you can see the same slab, which easily wobbles on its ever-growing camera hump that’s sticking out of the razor-thin case like a bad case of optical melanoma. At this point in time, the most exciting thing about cellphones is whether it can flip or not, followed by whatever subdued color is applied to the slippery glass back that you want to cover up with something concealing and grippy as soon as possible anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally, it’s not just phones either, but also computers, with the iMac’s evolution showing a clear ‘evolution’ from colorful and bold designs to geometric slabs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you call it ‘modern’ or ‘clean’ design, the trend is quite clear. Curves are removed, colors are purged or at the very least muted and the overall design reduced to the level of excitement experienced while being stuck at an Ikea showroom during a busy weekend with the family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lifeless Slabs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a time when televisions had a recognizable look to them, with a stylish bezel, a real power button, as well as a couple of front input connectors and buttons to adjust basic settings like volume and the current channel, which could also be hidden behind a small flap. This is now all gone, and TVs have become as visually striking from the front as modern smartphones, with the speakers fully nerfed since there’s no space on the front any more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All inputs and any remaining controls are now hidden on the back where reaching them is borderline impossible after installation, never mind if you mounted it on a wall. You’re not supposed to find the TV visually appealing, or marvel at the easy user interface, just consume whatever content is displayed on the bezel-less screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of any home entertainment setup has undergone the same process, with the HiFi stacks and mid-sized sets of yesteryear replaced by the same smartphones and TVs, along with a bit of plastic that you can stick into a slab TV to stream content with from some internet-based service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than a stereo – or better – HiFi setup, most people will have a bunch of usually mono Bluetooth speakers scattered around, each of which possessing the visual appeal of a radar dome. If you’re lucky there are still a couple of touch buttons to fondle, but virtually all of your interactions with such devices will go via an app on your slab phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Touch controls are also all that you will get these days, as physical buttons, dials, sliders and switches are almost completely faux pas in modern-day product design. Everything has to be smooth, stealthy, invisibly present and yet always there when you crave that entertainment fix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This design language isn’t just afflicting home electronics either, as over the past years car interiors have seen physical user controls vanish in favor of one or more touch screens, with cars like those from Tesla being the most extreme example with just a single large touch screen on the center console as the sole user interface. Users are however pushing back against this change, with a number of studies also showing that touch-only controls are less effective and less safe than fumbling around on a big screen while driving to adjust something like the climate controls or radio station.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;There Is An App For That&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to set up your new formless slab of plastic or fabric? Please download this special mobile app to do anything with it. Got a new pair of headphones? Better pray that the mobile app works well on your slab phone or you’ll be stuck with whatever preset defaults it came with, as physical controls on the device are for dummies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether we like it or not, the human user interface part of industrial design has been mostly taken out back and replaced with software running on a slab phone. Whatever vestigial controls still remain on the device itself will only be a small subset of what its electronics and firmware are capable of. The slab phone has thus become the user interface, with that part of industrial design often outsourced to some third-party mobile app developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has massively backfired for some companies already, with Sonos in 2024 releasing a ‘new and improved’ version of its slab phone app that was so buggy and plagued with issues that it rendered the Sonos speaker hardware effectively useless. While physical user interfaces have their issues, sinking an entire company due to a badly arranged set of knobs is not as easy as with a slab phone app or equivalent, not to mention the potential to retroactively brick the user interface of devices that people have already purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Yearning For That Human Touch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we can see parallels with computer user interfaces, where much like with industrial design there’s a big push to reduce shapes to the most basic geometric forms, remove or reduce color and remove any ‘superfluous’ styling including skeuomorphism. These parallels are perhaps not that surprising, as companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft produce both consumer hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google, for example, has heavily invested in its Material Design design language, which can be summarized as having flat color backgrounds with the most simplistic UI elements suspended in said void. UI elements like the ‘hamburger’ icon are used to hide menus not just on phones, but also on desktop systems, where a form of extreme minimalism is being pushed to its ultimate extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of consumer electronics that means devices that lack any distinguishable features, as minimalism is a poor way to distinguish one product from another. The removal of visually pleasing and physically practical elements also means a dull, stimulation-free experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no pleasing elements to rest your eyes on, no curves or colors that invoke an emotional response, no buttons to press, or any kind of auditory or physical response. Just lifeless touch controls on slabs of plastic and glass with maybe a sad beep as confirmation of a touch control having been triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this context, what is often called the revival of physical media can be interpreted as not just a yearning for a more visceral audio-visual experience, but would together with so-called retro-computing be a way to experience personal electronics in a way that stimulates and invigorates. Where physical buttons are pressed, sliders slid, dials turned and things go click and whirr as one’s fingers touch and manipulate the very real user interface elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that chronic boredom can be extremely harmful to non-human animals, with enrichment toys and activities prescribed to make them happier and more content. With modern day consumer electronics having become incredibly dull due to the death of industrial design, it would seem that us human mammals are seeking out our own enrichment activities, modern design sensibilities be damned. If this means repeating the sins of early 2000s or 1990s industrial design in our personal hobbyist projects, it’s a price worth to pay for keeping ourselves and our fellow humans happy and enriched.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The digital world of 2025 is an increasingly dark place—promises of an end-of-history, neoliberal technotopia have foundered on the rocks of monopoly, nativism, and a fractured epistemological understanding of the world. I’ve personally seen the retreat from the “digital public square” to semi-private spaces: group chats, invite-only servers, forums. Some of them are “group chats that rule the world.” Indeed, we seem to be, collectively, past “Peak Social Media.” This week, Julia Kieserman investigates the rise of a different sort of digital private space: social location sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;“Lighthouses in the Sky”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By Julia B. Kieserman&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My brother is a notoriously awful texter. Texts go unacknowledged for days and then weeks, sheepishly answered only when he has stumbled upon a meme, an article, or a funny anecdote he wants to share. While frustrating, there is an honesty to the implicit demand that we make no expectations on his unreliable and often unreachable virtual self. It holds the faintest echo of a time when a landline’s sharp ring cut through the silence of an empty house or a hastily signed postcard arrived mildly battered three months after the fact. It is a declaration of liberation from a shiny piece of alloy, bits of Earth extracted and reconstituted to weigh down our pockets and wear down our fingers. He is not his phone and his phone is not him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or at least, it wasn’t him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, he started sharing his location with us, the friends and family who love him. With the flick of a wrist, he absolved himself of the stress of answering the question that location sharing is best suited to answer: where are you right now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My brother isn’t alone. A 2022 Harris poll found that four in five U.S. adults use location sharing tools like Apple’s FindMy and Google Maps to share their real-time location data with whomever they choose. While we have long known that we are being watched by the advertising industry, the bread and butter business that keeps our tech behemoths afloat, location sharing now puts us in the power seat, allowing us to become the watchers (or the watched) as we silently observe the movements of our friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me this immediately raised alarm bells. Having a friend’s location on demand appears to strip them of the very same autonomy that nearly every teenager fights so hard for against their parents. Why is this something we find attractive and how might it be impacting our ability to maintain relationships with one another? In an attempt to answer these questions, I talked to 15 location sharers and polled an additional 67 to discuss how location sharing is part of their lives and understand why they share, who they share with, and what it really means to them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like other infrastructure, the Global Positioning System’s (GPS) seeming dullness disguises a mild technological miracle. Accurately rendering each GPS dot on a map requires a roundtrip journey to space, atomic clocks, and communication with no less than three satellites in medium Earth orbit or, as inventor Dr. Ivan Getting put it, “lighthouses in the sky.” To consider it this way is to see it as a bit magical, perhaps the way weary sea travelers see lighthouses on land, or the way the Polaris (also known as the North Star, the spiritual ancestor of GPS) appears to those who turn to it for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at it—a layer of personal dots on top of a world map—also feels a bit magical, as evidenced by several people who described taking screenshots of maps during a birthday party, marveling at overlapping dots in a central location; their people. To use location sharing is to engage in a cartography well-suited for the modern world. In fact, even though GPS was built with the U.S. military in mind, it is so useful—it’s first civilian use case was aiding commercial aircraft navigation—that it was anointed a dual-use technology, as legitimate in civilian life as it is in military life. Four decades later, the primary functionality of GPS still hasn’t changed: a family taking a cross-country road trip, captains in charge of shipping containers, and a tourist on foot in a new city all turn to GPS with the same questions. In fact, everyone I spoke with used location sharing to consider questions of logistics if nothing else. Where is the friend who left the bar alone? The one running late to dinner? Where is the group I’ve lost at a concert? Where is my mother, navigating herself around my neighborhood?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when these questions are focused on our own community, the people who love us enough to trust us with their personal location, it quickly becomes more than just a matter of logistics; our brains can’t help but to craft a narrative about what we are seeing. We want to know if our friends make it home from the bar and that our parents are safe because we care for them and we are invested in what happens to them. So we start to speculate: it’s only natural to try and create a story with a limited set of information as a way of sense-making. But how well does this fare when the information we have to craft with is as narrow as a single dot in a moment in time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most obvious examples of location sharing gone awry are stories of abuse. Two people I spoke with had personal experiences of being harassed through location sharing tools by romantic or potential romantic partners. In one case, GPS was used to first construct an inaccurate and accusatory narrative about a partner’s behavior that nitpicked the details—an impromptu detour to the cafeteria en route to the library was suddenly cause for suspicion—and then to show up unannounced to physically confront them. The experience was harrowing and fundamentally changed the way one woman thinks about sharing her location. She now uses it only for safety and logistics and is far more intentional about where she does and does not want to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While stories like this one are important examples of the dangers of using location sharing, it can be easy to write them off as edge cases, to assume that this is indicative of dangerous people rather than dangerous technology. And this may be true to some extent. After all, stalking and abusive partners have existed for far longer than location sharing tools have, even if they make bad behavior that much easier. But even those of us with the best of intentions may still get the story wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider what happened to Tess, a woman in her mid-twenties living in New York City. On a Friday night out with friends, she lost her phone. Location sharing came to the rescue when she was able to track it to a local police station where it had been turned in. Although the station was already closed for the weekend, she was content knowing it was safe. But Tess is a sharer and her community of watchers, the inner circle she had entrusted with her location, was far less content. They repeatedly called and messaged her to find out why she was locked in a police station. In the absence of any information beyond an immobile dot at a concerning location, narrative inference kicked in and they began to assume the worst. She spent the subsequent two days fielding messages through borrowed devices to notify her friends that it was her phone behind the locked doors of a police station, not her.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some, myself included, this story might read as a tale of sanctioned voyeurism or even friendly stalking. That the same tool that helped Tess find her phone also made her watchable in this way is what researchers have, perhaps as an ode to its military roots, termed dual-use software. But for Tess, this is a story of caretaking and serves as evidence that she belongs to a community that has her back. This makes sense—should the details have been just a little bit different, she knows definitively that people were ready to jump into action for her. Tess isn’t alone. Nearly everyone who used location sharing believed that interpersonal surveillance—or to put it colloquially, location sharing—is part of an effective safety toolkit. Many people took comfort in the fact that a selection of friends and family were watching them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This idea isn’t new; late urban activist Jane Jacobs described “eyes upon the street” as an important quality of a safe and healthy city neighborhood. Eyes are what keep well-intentioned people safe and keep the less well-intentioned afraid to act out of line. To some extent, location sharing allows us to redefine our own “street” as dynamic corners around the globe, replacing neighbors, shopkeepers and other “natural proprietors” with our friends and family, however many physical streets apart we may actually be. But it is a fundamentally different approach to safety. With location sharing, we can only see the people we trust, not the ones we worry about. If the assumption is that being surveilled deters bad behavior (which seems to have only a modest effect in practice), then those who we are trying to deter need to know they are being surveilled. This tool doesn’t do that and in its absence, location sharing becomes—except in extreme cases of abduction or missing people—something more akin to a security blanket than a real safety tool. Perhaps fittingly, while nearly all of the people I spoke with felt safer knowing someone was watching to make sure they made it home, none of them had personally found location sharing tools to reveal a friend in crisis. The only exception was one person who had been explicitly instructed by a friend that to see them in a particular location was to see them in a state of distress. But even in this case, location alone wasn’t enough to claim someone was or was not unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even Jacobs believed that “there must be a clear demarcation between what is public space and what is private space.” There are spheres of life that should be safe from prying eyes, perhaps because eyes aren’t just watching us, but also changing us. The reason we feel that surveillance works as a safety apparatus is because we believe that we—or someone we are worried about—might behave differently under watch. Sometimes those private behaviors are ultimately quite trivial, like collecting supplies for a surprise birthday party. Other times they might be far more consequential, like going to an appointment at an abortion clinic. Even when the consequences are small, being watched by people we are clearly inclined to share with robs us of the opportunity to do so ourselves which, eventually, can impact the very nature of our relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was certainly true for Sofia (referred to by her middle name), a professional in her early thirties living in New York City. One evening she was sitting at a bar waiting for her Hinge date when a flurry of texts peppered her screen in a group chat. It was a stream of encouragement, unsolicited drink recommendations for the particular bar she was at and jestful sexual innuendos from her gaggle of single women. She hadn’t told them she was going out but she didn’t need to. She had granted them permission to see her location and they took the opportunity to show up as her background cheer squad. If the date went well and she went back to his place, they would absolutely notice—and have something to say about it. They operated as a modern, tech savvy version of the iconic Sex &amp;amp; The City clique, in part thanks to location sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a delightful and powerful way to use location sharing, GPS as a “conversation tool,” which strengthens the bonds between a community of women navigating the often challenging experience of dating in the city. But now, when Sofia reaches for her phone the morning after a date, her friends might already know some pieces of her story, like how late she stayed out and whose home she is waking up in. This might seem small and, as we saw in Tess’ case, it leaves out nearly all of the significant details which could differentiate between the world’s best first date and a mostly negligible evening. But even so, location sharing has created an outline for Sofia to fill in, rather than giving her complete control over the telling of her story. I personally find this a lackluster alternative to a dramatic retelling but this distinction probably has an even more meaningful impact; social penetration theory suggests that a key way to maintain or progress relationships is the act of self-disclosure, repeatedly sharing increasingly intimate details about oneself with another. Perhaps ironically, location sharing can be an effective way to share intimate information but it erodes the experience of disclosure that is so crucial to building relationship trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One woman I spoke with admitted to finding this behavior—watching how late a friend is out on a first date—to be a little bit awkward and wrestled with whether to mention what she saw or wait for her friend to bring it up, an acknowledgement of the sometimes squishy norms of how to act (or not) on location information. But nearly everyone believed that these increased “touch points” (a term borrowed from marketing, an industry heavily reliant on surveillance) had a positive impact. In fact they found this to be a valuable feature of location sharing, a way of creating possible connection points that wouldn’t have existed otherwise. People learned of friends spending time in their neighborhood or on an international excursion through location sharing and used it as an excuse to reach out to them. This probably is a useful way to keep in touch and, as one woman pointed out, certainly makes it easier to keep details straight, like the dates and location of a friend’s trip. But it also has—to borrow the term once again—a dual effect on how we interact with each other, both of which remove opportunities for real connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Location sharing erases an information boundary, removing the interaction typically required to learn about what our friends are doing. We can see a friend is on a trip “for free,” without having to speak to them at all. At the same time, this information is used to create an additional layer between us and our friends and family. Nearly everyone I spoke to mentioned they would check someone’s location before calling, in case a dot on a map implied (because of course, how could one know for sure) that they were in a location that wasn’t conducive to actually taking a call. Suddenly, because the information existed, people felt uncomfortable not using it as a boundary, thus reducing the frequency of spontaneous interaction. This is to say nothing of the out-group location sharing creates, the lingering luddites who refuse to share location; how long until to fall off someone’s map is to fall out of someone’s life?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I began this journey certain that location sharing was a societal ill. I was convinced that the word “sharing,” a euphemistic wrapper around the real word—tracking—was an intentional choice by technology companies to mask the work of normalizing surveillance behavior in our communities. Talking to a group of people happily or even cautiously sharing location didn’t convince me otherwise. But it did remind me that there is yet another way to define dual-use technology; technology that can be reclaimed by communities to serve their own purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That isn’t quite the location sharing of today. After all, location sharing as we have defined it here is still a framework named for us and provided to us by technology giants like Google and Apple. But maybe there is room for a middle ground, one that acknowledges that location sharing really can create communities of care, drawing invisible lines between friends and families separated by mountains and oceans. It is meaningful that those with no visibility are offered a new way to connect and, while I don’t think it is really making us safer most of the time, it is making us feel safer. Perhaps that should count for something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t to make the case that we should readily accept or even make do with what we have, particularly for those of us living in uncertain political environments, where any data point can be weaponized as quickly and casually as a shift in the clouds. But it is to acknowledge that perhaps there is room for a new infrastructure, one not rooted in surveillance capitalism but built from basic human desire. Perhaps the new paradigm moves away from real-time tracking or individual location and towards things like distress signals and collective third places. The power of GPS is still quite magical, but nowhere near as powerful as the magic of humans showing each other care and curiosity. One doesn’t need to steal from the other.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;RIP Ken Parker: August 25, 1952 – October 5, 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ken Parker, age 73, passed away peacefully at his home in Gloucester, MA on October 5, 2025, with Susan Kolwicz by his side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Ken, October 3rd, 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, they say that nothing lasts forever and they’re right about that. My time here is about to close down and I won’t be part of the show anymore. What I have done with all my heart and soul is to put together a situation where my work can continue unabated and begin to bring some serious fruit to the things that I’ve been working on for the last 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My deepest and most heartfelt thanks to all of you. It’s been the experience of my lifetime being able to share my life’s work and knowledge with each of you through my instruments and via Archtoppery, and see that you get it. My hope is that you all build on what I’ve learned and shared, and take everything to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sam Krimmel will be doing just that, and I encourage you to support Sam as he ventures forth. Sam is a natural co-conspirator and he and I will be will be working together down the road through some sort of psychic medium. We’ve already got some amazing new things underway and soon we’re going to show you what that is all about. So stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All right, well everyone, please take care of yourselves and peace on earth, if that should ever be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Love, Ken&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Germany Embraces Balkonkraftwerke — Balcony Solar For Apartments&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Lots of people, especially city dwellers and renters, don’t have rooftops where they can install solar panels to generate some of the electricity they use in their daily lives. Community solar offers a partial solution for some, but it is not available everywhere. In Germany, more than 1.5 million people have installed Balkonkraftwerke, which translates as “balcony power plants.” Almost every apartment has a balcony with a railing to keep folks from tumbling into the street below. If it gets any sun exposure during the day, balcony solar panels can be mounted to those railings to make electricity that helps power a home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proponents say balcony solar panels are easy to install on railings (and uninstall if need be in the event of storms). Once in place, people simply plug a micro-inverter into an available wall outlet. Add a small battery to store any solar energy not needed right away and you have your own personal micro-minigrid inside your home. The systems sell for between $500 and $1000, depending on the number of solar panels purchased. A typical system consists of two 150-watt panels and can pay for itself in a few years. It is also highly portable, so it can easily be transported from one apartment to another if the owner moves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Germany Leads In Balcony Solar&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Grist, Germany now has more than 550,000 balcony solar installations, half of which were installed in 2023. During the first six months of 2024, Germany added 200 megawatts of balcony solar. Regulations limit each system to just 800 watts, which is enough to power a small fridge or charge a laptop, but the cumulative effect is nudging the country toward its clean energy goals while giving apartment dwellers, who make up more than half of the German population, an easy way to save money and address the climate crisis. Matthias Weyland, who lives in Keil, tells Grist, “I love the feeling of charging the bike when the sun is shining, or having the washing machine run when the sun is shining, and to know that it comes directly from the sun. It’s a small step you can take as a tenant” and an act of “self-efficacy, to not just sit and wait until the climate crisis gets worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Balcony solar started a decade ago, but didn’t really catch on until 2019 when the German government enacted the first technical regulations for plug-in solar devices, allowing balcony solar systems to use standard electrical plugs and feed into the grid. That prompted an influx of plug-in devices and advocates to promote the technology. The pandemic helped fuel the surge in popularity as people spent more time working from home. The escalating energy price of electricity that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led more Germans to consider balcony solar. “People just did anything they could to reduce their energy bills,” said Wolfgang Gründinger, who works with the clean energy company Enpal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April, the German government simplified permitting and registration requirements, and in July, federal lawmakers passed renter protections that prevent landlords from arbitrarily blocking installations. Cities throughout Germany, including Berlin, have offered millions of euros in subsidies to install balcony solar. Gründinger and experts at the German Solar Industry Association noted that the devices don’t generate enough power to strain the grid, and their standardized design and safety features allow them to integrate into balconies smoothly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of them like the idea of producing energy at home and gaining a bit of independence from the grid. The system also provides a tangible way to take climate action. “It makes the energy transition feel a little more concrete and not so abstract,” said Helena Holenweger of Environmental Action Germany. She installed a balcony solar system on top of her garage about a year ago. “You can literally do something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raising Climate Consciousness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holenweger and others say balcony solar led them to reevaluate their understanding of electricity consumption and take steps to reduce it. “For lots of people, energy is just something that comes out of your socket. You never think about how it gets there or how it works.” The systems don’t include battery storage, so the juice they generate must be used immediately, leading people to plan the best time to run the washing machine to ensure they’re using renewable energy. In that way, it becomes something of a game. Many balcony solar kits feature an app to track daily energy generation. That has become something of a scorecard for many who have balcony solar systems. “They screenshot that, they send it around to their Facebook groups, family WhatsApp groups. They’re super proud,” Gründinger said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manufacturers say that installing a couple of 300-watt panels will give savings of up to 30% on a typical household’s electricity bill, but there are lots of variables that come with that claim. It depends on which direction the balcony faces and whether the panels are shaded part of the day. Perhaps the biggest benefit is the increased awareness of the need to find solutions to climate emissions. People with balcony solar systems influence others and it seems reasonable to expect they will vote for leaders who share their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Balcony Solar In Spain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Spain, where two thirds of the population live in apartments and installing panels on the roof requires the consent of a majority of the building’s residents, this DIY technology has obvious advantages. With solar balconies, no such consent is required unless the facade is listed as being of historic interest or there is a specific prohibition from the residents’ association or the local authority. According to The Guardian, as long as the installation does not exceed 800 watts — about what a typical hairdryer uses — one doesn’t require certification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The beauty of the solar balconies is they are flexible, cheap and plug straight into the domestic network via a converter, so you don’t have to pay for the installation,” says Santiago Vernetta, CEO of Tornasol Energy, one of Spain’s main suppliers. As the cost of solar panels continues to fall, Vernetta says the labor cost of installing rooftop solar is often greater than the price of the materials. He adds that the vertical surface area of cities is far greater than that of available roofs and that balcony panels benefit more than roof panels from the low winter sun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Raquel Paule, director of the Fundación Renovables in Madrid, says the increasingly popular energy communities in which residents benefit from solar installations on the roofs of nearby schools and sports centers are another way around the problem of majority consent. “Balcony power is another piece in the puzzle. They are another step towards using the built environment to generate electricity. Paule emphasizes that self sufficiency, whether in individual households or energy communities, is a vital part of energy transition, especially for cities which depend on outside sources for about 97% of their electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Cities need to become more self-sufficient by generating more,” she says. “Energy transition involves a change from cities depending on a centralised system with big companies supplying electricity to a more widely distributed, more democratic and more participative model, and this is what the energy companies are scared of. Big energy companies should be pushing for renewables because they’ve played a big part in getting us into this situation. Instead of creating obstacles, they should be facilitators by giving everyone access to the grid that they control.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Plug-in solar is part of the whole array of options,” says Michael Schmela, director of market intelligence at SolarPower Europe, an umbrella group for 320 European solar power organisations. “What’s special about balcony power is it’s so versatile and you can install it as part of the building. This is the next step. The technology is there but the regulations and architects have to embrace it. There are so many solutions and balcony solar is the latest trend. For years solar has been the fastest growing and cheapest in the energy sector,” Schmela says, adding that what is needed now is battery development and greater cohesion between wind, solar, and other renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vernetta says Spain has been slow to catch on to balcony power, but he remains confident the technology will take off. “If 1.5 million Germans have bought solar balcony kits there must be something in it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
