    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Company as Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reimagining organisational structure for the digital age.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, as I sat across from our ISO 27001 information security auditor, watching them strenuously work through our documentation, a thought struck me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here we are, a software company, with nearly all of our operations running in interconnected digital systems, yet the core of our business—our policies, procedures, and organisational structure—is a basic collection of documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It just felt ironic. We use advanced tools to automate compliance checks, store our code in version-controlled repositories, and manage our infrastructure as code. However, when describing and managing our company, we resort to digital paper and tidbits of info distributed across people in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The disconnect became increasingly apparent as I reflected on our day-to-day process: 90% of our products, documents, communication, and decision-making live in digital channels. That’s data. It lives in the cloud, spread over SaaS solutions that specialise in handling individual work processes—all systems with robust APIs and programmatic access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the centre of it all sits a lonely island of documents: our ambitions, goals, policies and formal structures. And I think those are pretty important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our security posture was solid before we even considered ISO 27001 because we’d already worked hard to comply with our customer’s requirements. Between collecting evidence for controls, arguing about and updating policy wording, document review, and the actual audit, we spent hundreds of additional person-hours that could’ve otherwise been spent creating great products for our users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A missing link&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we desire operational data to be so rich, why do we accept organisational data to be so sparse? We’ve revolutionised how we handle infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), how we manage deployments with GitOps, and how we handle security with Policy as Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when representing our organisation (the beating heart of our operations), we apply old-school methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine if we could represent our entire organisational structure programmatically instead—not a static picture, but a living, breathing digital representation of our company that can be versioned, queried, tested, and automatically verified. A system where policy changes could be tracked as code changes, where compliance could be continuously monitored, and where the relationships between people, processes and technology could be explicitly mapped and understood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thinking bigger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing solutions like HRIS systems manage people data but struggle with policy relationships. GRC tools track compliance but rarely connect meaningfully to organisational structure. I’m proposing we think bigger. It’s about creating a holistic, programmatic representation of the entire organisation: a “company manifest” that serves as a single source of truth for organisational structure, policy, and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider how helpful this might be for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compliance audits: Instead of manually piecing together evidence from various systems, auditors could query the company manifest directly, with clear traceability between policies and their implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Policy changes: Updates could be version-controlled, and automated impact analysis could show which teams and processes would be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Organisational design: Leaders could model structural changes in a “staging environment” before implementing them, gaining a better understanding of how changes cause ripple effects throughout the company.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why isn’t this a thing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As this idea swirls around in my mind, I find more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried this yet? If not, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it because organisations are inherently too complex and dynamic to be represented as code? If so, that seems at odds with regulation and standards, where we expect corporate activities to be so uniform and procedural that we can reliably stamp them as compliant, non-compliant, legal, or illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it because we haven’t yet found the right abstraction level—the equivalent of what Infrastructure as Code did for system administration?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tools and concepts exist: Graph databases for representing organisational relationships, domain-specific languages for describing business rules, and API-first architectures for integration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe what’s missing is a framework to bring these ideas together in a way that’s powerful enough to be useful and simple enough to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Putting it into practice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s think about how this could work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section, I’ll fantasise about what I would want from “Company as Code.” Then, I’ll map that to some system components that could address those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an engineer and business stakeholder, I would want a company model to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Queryable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system must trace relationships between people, policies, and systems—similar to code dependency tracking. Users should easily see the organisation from different angles, such as which people are affected by a policy and who owns it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Versionable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explicit tracking of organisational changes, including who made them, what changed, and why. This is crucial for audits and understanding organisational evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Integrated&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seamless data exchange with existing tools (Azure, Slack, etc.) to maintain an up-to-date organisational picture and enforce tool configurations based on policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Testable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A “staging environment” where organisational changes can be modeled before implementation, supporting automated tests for individual rules and controls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Accessible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though powered by code, the interface should be intuitive enough for non-technical leaders to use effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bringing this vision to life requires several puzzle pieces. Each component must address specific requirements to approximate something that can be powerful while being relatively simple to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A declarative language for organisations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform, let’s imagine a declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL) that reads naturally while expressing a formal structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic syntax follows a clear pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;EntityType "Identifier" {
    References = AnotherEntity.Identifier
    Attribute = Value
    ListAttribute = [
        "Item One",
        "Item Two"
    ]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A type, unique identifier, and set of attributes define each entity. Entities can reference each other using dot notation, creating a web of relationships that forms our organisational graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Specifying an organisation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's walk through how you could define a small engineering team in this language:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First, let’s define the roles that exist in the organisation:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Role "SoftwareEngineer" {
    Responsibilities = [
        "Write clean, maintainable code",
        "Participate in code reviews",
        "Document technical decisions"
    ]
}

Role "EngineeringManager" {
    Responsibilities = [
        "Provide technical leadership",
        "Conduct performance reviews",
        "Manage team resources"
    ]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next, we’ll create an organisational unit for our team:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;OrganisationalUnit "EngineeringTeam" {
    Department = "Engineering"
    CostCenter = "ENG-001"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With these structures in place, we can define the actual people and their relationships:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Person "AliceSmith" {
    FullName = "Alice Smith"
    Role = Role.EngineeringManager
    Unit = OrganisationalUnit.EngineeringTeam
    Email = "alice.smith@company.com"
}

Person "BobJohnson" {
    FullName = "Bob Johnson"
    Role = Role.SoftwareEngineer
    Unit = OrganisationalUnit.EngineeringTeam
    Manager = Person.AliceSmith
    Email = "bob.johnson@company.com"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Policy definitions create a framework for compliance:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;PolicyGroup "SecurityPolicies" {
    Owner = Person.AliceSmith
}

PolicyRule "MFARequired" {
    Group = PolicyGroup.SecurityPolicies
    Enforcement = "Mandatory"
    ComplianceLevel = "Critical"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, we can map these policies to external requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ExternalRequirement "ISO27001_A9_4_1" {
    Standard = "ISO 27001:2013"
    Control = "A.9.4.1"
    ComplianceLevel = "Mandatory"
}

ComplianceMapping "MFACompliance" {
    Requirement = ExternalRequirement.ISO27001_A9_4_1
    ImplementingPolicies = [PolicyRule.MFARequired]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This declarative approach allows us to build a complete picture of our organisation, from high-level structures to individual policies and their regulatory implications. Each definition is clear and self-documenting, while the references between entities create a graph of relationships that can be analysed, validated, and used to automate organisational processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a representation like this, we benefit from organising definitions into logical files and directories, treating organisational changes like code changes: versioned, reviewed, and validated before application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This enables practices like reviewing changes through pull requests, testing policy modifications before rollout, and automatically generating compliance documentation while tracking the evolution of organisational structures over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Building a model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform work with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to determine deployment order, an organisation's structure is inherently more interconnected. People manage other people, policies reference activities that refer back to policies, and teams have complex interdependencies. This calls for an undirected cyclic graph model to represent these rich relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public record Node(
    string Id,          // e.g. "Person.AliceSmith"
    string Type,        // e.g. "Person", "PolicyRule"
    List&amp;lt;Edge&amp;gt; Relations = null
);

public record Edge(
    string FromId, 
    string ToId,
    string RelationType, // e.g. "ManagedBy"
);

public class CompanyGraph
{
    private Dictionary&amp;lt;string, Node&amp;gt; _nodes = new();
    private List&amp;lt;Edge&amp;gt; _edges = new();

    public void AddNode(string id, string type) =&amp;gt;
        _nodes[id] = new Node(id, type);

    public void AddRelation(string fromId, string toId, string type)
    {
        var edge = new Edge(fromId, toId, type);
        _edges.Add(edge);
        (_nodes[fromId].Relations ??= new()).Add(edge);
        (_nodes[toId].Relations ??= new()).Add(edge);
    }

    // Example: Find all requirements impacted by changing a policy
    public IEnumerable&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt; GetImpactedRequirements(string policyId) =&amp;gt;
        _nodes[policyId].Relations
            .Where(e =&amp;gt; e.RelationType == "ImplementsRequirement")
            .Select(e =&amp;gt; _nodes[e.FromId == policyId ? e.ToId : e.FromId])
            .Where(req =&amp;gt; req.Type == "ExternalRequirement");
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The example above shows a naive implementation of a queryable graph structure based on a declarative DSL. This representation makes it easier to answer questions requiring multiple references in the structure, such as "Which external requirements would be affected if we changed our MFA policy?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bridging models and reality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A DSL can define an organisation's structure and rules, but the model must be connected to real-world data to be useful. This requires a storage strategy that can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Persist the organisational graph itself&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Store data associated with graph entities (like evidence)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enable validation of considered changes&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A way to deliver this at scale would be to combine several data stores: A graph database for the organisational model, a relational database for associated data, and an event store for audit trail and change tracking. If you wanted to start small, you could serialise all this information to your local filesystem instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To activate external data, we would need an integration framework with a plug-in architecture to bridge the organisational model and production systems. This would handle three key aspects: (1) data collection from integrated systems like GitHub or Azure, mapping evidence to nodes in our graph; (2) policy validation that programmatically checks collected evidence against rules; and (3) policy enforcement where organisational changes automatically trigger updates across connected systems—from employee provisioning to access permission changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DSL would supply this functionality using built-in modules or user-supplied plug-ins to perform the work needed to interact with other systems. Let’s imagine a Control entity in the DSL which uses a custom script to perform routine checks on MFA usage and links results to the compliance mapping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Control "MFAMonitoring" {
    Implements = ComplianceMapping.MFACompliance
    
    Verify {
        Script = "Security/mfa-checks.js"
        Methods = [
            "allUsersHaveMfaEnabled"
        ]
        Frequency = "Daily"
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then in &lt;code&gt;security/mfa-checks.js&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export async function allUsersHaveMfaEnabled() {
    const users = await myAuthClient.listUsers()
    return users.every(user =&amp;gt; user.mfaEnabled)
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution should be open and extendable to maximise its usefulness, allowing for custom integrations, validations, and automation. Terraform does a good job of this with its “Providers” plug-in architecture, although integrations to inspect and modify data in corporate systems might need to support more custom scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For organisations wanting to test this approach, you could start small:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Model just your organisational structure and reporting lines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add key policies and compliance mappings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Begin connecting to your most critical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Making it shine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A code-based declaration of an organisation offers powerful capabilities for technologists, but we also need to acknowledge that many business stakeholders don’t “think in code”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The elegance of a DSL doesn’t have to be limited to those most comfortable with text editors and version control software. A genuinely accessible “Company as Code” solution must connect a programmatic representation and the business users who make daily decisions about organisation structure, policy and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This could be solved with a low-code / no-code interface where:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Business leaders drag and drop organisational entities and reporting structures while the system generates code declarations behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compliance officers use simple forms to define policies and instantly visualise which parts of the business they affect. When regulations change, they can quickly identify gaps or conflicts through visual highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Technologists keep the codebase organised and provide data integrations and tools to implement policy in external systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With an approach like this, we can maintain the rigour of the code model while making it accessible to everyone. Changes through the interface update the underlying code, preserving that single source of truth that can be versioned and validated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Final notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the technical feasibility, the real promise lies in the organisational benefits: faster audits, clearer decision-making, and better understanding of changes' impact before implementing them. Hundreds of hours spent on compliance documentation could instead be invested in creating value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, I hoped to establish that a codification of organisational structure is missing and that it’s buildable. Practical? Don’t know. Viable? I don’t have the answer. Buildable, though? Yes. I believe so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Claude Opus 4.6&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re upgrading our smartest model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Claude Opus 4.6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4.6 features a 1M token context window in beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opus 4.6 can also apply its improved abilities to a range of everyday work tasks: running financial analyses, doing research, and using and creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Within Cowork, where Claude can multitask autonomously, Opus 4.6 can put all these skills to work on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model’s performance is state-of-the-art on several evaluations. For example, it achieves the highest score on the agentic coding evaluation Terminal-Bench 2.0 and leads all other frontier models on Humanity’s Last Exam, a complex multidisciplinary reasoning test. On GDPval-AA—an evaluation of performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal, and other domains1—Opus 4.6 outperforms the industry’s next-best model (OpenAI’s GPT-5.2) by around 144 Elo points,2 and its own predecessor (Claude Opus 4.5) by 190 points. Opus 4.6 also performs better than any other model on BrowseComp, which measures a model’s ability to locate hard-to-find information online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we show in our extensive system card, Opus 4.6 also shows an overall safety profile as good as, or better than, any other frontier model in the industry, with low rates of misaligned behavior across safety evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Claude Code, you can now assemble agent teams to work on tasks together. On the API, Claude can use compaction to summarize its own context and perform longer-running tasks without bumping up against limits. We’re also introducing adaptive thinking, where the model can pick up on contextual clues about how much to use its extended thinking, and new effort controls to give developers more control over intelligence, speed, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve made substantial upgrades to Claude in Excel, and we’re releasing Claude in PowerPoint in a research preview. This makes Claude much more capable for everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is available today on claude.ai, our API, and all major cloud platforms. If you’re a developer, use &lt;code&gt;claude-opus-4-6&lt;/code&gt; via the Claude API. Pricing remains the same at $5/$25 per million tokens; for full details, see our pricing page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cover the model, our new product updates, our evaluations, and our extensive safety testing in depth below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First impressions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We build Claude with Claude. Our engineers write code with Claude Code every day, and every new model first gets tested on our own work. With Opus 4.6, we’ve found that the model brings more focus to the most challenging parts of a task without being told to, moves quickly through the more straightforward parts, handles ambiguous problems with better judgment, and stays productive over longer sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opus 4.6 often thinks more deeply and more carefully revisits its reasoning before settling on an answer. This produces better results on harder problems, but can add cost and latency on simpler ones. If you’re finding that the model is overthinking on a given task, we recommend dialing effort down from its default setting (high) to medium. You can control this easily with the &lt;code&gt;/effort&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the things our Early Access partners told us about Claude Opus 4.6, including its propensity to work autonomously without hand-holding, its success where previous models failed, and its effect on how teams work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is the strongest model Anthropic has shipped. It takes complicated requests and actually follows through, breaking them into concrete steps, executing, and producing polished work even when the task is ambitious. For Notion users, it feels less like a tool and more like a capable collaborator.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Early testing shows Claude Opus 4.6 delivering on the complex, multi-step coding work developers face every day—especially agentic workflows that demand planning and tool calling. This starts unlocking long-horizon tasks at the frontier.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is a huge leap for agentic planning. It breaks complex tasks into independent subtasks, runs tools and subagents in parallel, and identifies blockers with real precision.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is the best model we've tested yet. Its reasoning and planning capabilities have been exceptional at powering our AI Teammates. It's also a fantastic coding model – its ability to navigate a large codebase and identify the right changes to make is state of the art.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 reasons through complex problems at a level we haven't seen before. It considers edge cases that other models miss and consistently lands on more elegant, well-considered solutions. We're particularly impressed with Opus 4.6 in Devin Review, where it's increased our bug catching rates.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 feels noticeably better than Opus 4.5 in Windsurf, especially on tasks that require careful exploration like debugging and understanding unfamiliar codebases. We’ve noticed Opus 4.6 thinks longer, which pays off when deeper reasoning is needed.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 represents a meaningful leap in long-context performance. In our testing, we saw it handle much larger bodies of information with a level of consistency that strengthens how we design and deploy complex research workflows. Progress in this area gives us more powerful building blocks to deliver truly expert-grade systems professionals can trust.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Across 40 cybersecurity investigations, Claude Opus 4.6 produced the best results 38 of 40 times in a blind ranking against Claude 4.5 models. Each model ran end to end on the same agentic harness with up to 9 subagents and 100+ tool calls.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is the new frontier on long-running tasks from our internal benchmarks and testing. It's also been highly effective at reviewing code.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 achieved the highest BigLaw Bench score of any Claude model at 90.2%. With 40% perfect scores and 84% above 0.8, it’s remarkably capable for legal reasoning.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 autonomously closed 13 issues and assigned 12 issues to the right team members in a single day, managing a ~50-person organization across 6 repositories. It handled both product and organizational decisions while synthesizing context across multiple domains, and it knew when to escalate to a human.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is an uplift in design quality. It works beautifully with our design systems and it’s more autonomous, which is core to Lovable’s values. People should be creating things that matter, not micromanaging AI.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 excels in high-reasoning tasks like multi-source analysis across legal, financial, and technical content. Box’s eval showed a 10% lift in performance, reaching 68% vs. a 58% baseline, and near-perfect scores in technical domains.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 generates complex, interactive apps and prototypes in Figma Make with an impressive creative range. The model translates detailed designs and multi-layered tasks into code on the first try, making it a powerful starting point for teams to explore and build ideas.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is the best Anthropic model we’ve tested. It understands intent with minimal prompting and went above and beyond, exploring and creating details I didn’t even know I wanted until I saw them. It felt like I was working with the model, not waiting on it.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Both hands-on testing and evals show Claude Opus 4.6 is a meaningful improvement for design systems and large codebases, use cases that drive enormous enterprise value. It also one-shotted a fully functional physics engine, handling a large multi-scope task in a single pass.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is the biggest leap I’ve seen in months. I’m more comfortable giving it a sequence of tasks across the stack and letting it run. It’s smart enough to use subagents for the individual pieces.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 handled a multi-million-line codebase migration like a senior engineer. It planned up front, adapted its strategy as it learned, and finished in half the time.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;We only ship models in v0 when developers will genuinely feel the difference. Claude Opus 4.6 passed that bar with ease. Its frontier-level reasoning, especially with edge cases, helps v0 to deliver on our number-one aim: to let anyone elevate their ideas from prototype to production.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The performance jump with Claude Opus 4.6 feels almost unbelievable. Real-world tasks that were challenging for Opus [4.5] suddenly became easy. This feels like a watershed moment for spreadsheet agents on Shortcut.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Evaluating Claude Opus 4.6&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across agentic coding, computer use, tool use, search, and finance, Opus 4.6 is an industry-leading model, often by a wide margin. The table below shows how Claude Opus 4.6 compares to our previous models and to other industry models on a variety of benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opus 4.6 is much better at retrieving relevant information from large sets of documents. This extends to long-context tasks, where it holds and tracks information over hundreds of thousands of tokens with less drift, and picks up buried details that even Opus 4.5 would miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common complaint about AI models is “context rot,” where performance degrades as conversations exceed a certain number of tokens. Opus 4.6 performs markedly better than its predecessors: on the 8-needle 1M variant of MRCR v2—a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark that tests a model’s ability to retrieve information “hidden” in vast amounts of text—Opus 4.6 scores 76%, whereas Sonnet 4.5 scores just 18.5%. This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, Opus 4.6 is better at finding information across long contexts, better at reasoning after absorbing that information, and has substantially better expert-level reasoning abilities in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the charts below show how Claude Opus 4.6 performs on a variety of benchmarks that assess its software engineering skills, multilingual coding ability, long-term coherence, cybersecurity capabilities, and its life sciences knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A step forward on safety&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;These intelligence gains do not come at the cost of safety. On our automated behavioral audit, Opus 4.6 showed a low rate of misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, encouragement of user delusions, and cooperation with misuse. Overall, it is just as well-aligned as its predecessor, Claude Opus 4.5, which was our most-aligned frontier model to date. Opus 4.6 also shows the lowest rate of over-refusals—where the model fails to answer benign queries—of any recent Claude model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Claude Opus 4.6, we ran the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any model, applying many different tests for the first time and upgrading several that we’ve used before. We included new evaluations for user wellbeing, more complex tests of the model’s ability to refuse potentially dangerous requests, and updated evaluations of the model’s ability to surreptitiously perform harmful actions. We also experimented with new methods from interpretability, the science of the inner workings of AI models, to begin to understand why the model behaves in certain ways—and, ultimately, to catch problems that standard testing might miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed description of all capability and safety evaluations is available in the Claude Opus 4.6 system card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also applied new safeguards in areas where Opus 4.6 shows particular strengths that might be put to dangerous as well as beneficial uses. In particular, since the model shows enhanced cybersecurity abilities, we’ve developed six new cybersecurity probes—methods of detecting harmful responses—to help us track different forms of potential misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also accelerating the cyberdefensive uses of the model, using it to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software (as we describe in our new cybersecurity blog post). We think it’s critical that cyberdefenders use AI models like Claude to help level the playing field. Cybersecurity moves fast, and we’ll be adjusting and updating our safeguards as we learn more about potential threats; in the near future, we may institute real-time intervention to block abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Product and API updates&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve made substantial updates across Claude, Claude Code, and the Claude Developer Platform to let Opus 4.6 perform at its best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Developer Platform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the API, we’re giving developers better control over model effort and more flexibility for long-running agents. To do so, we’re introducing the following features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Adaptive thinking. Previously, developers only had a binary choice between enabling or disabling extended thinking. Now, with adaptive thinking, Claude can decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful. At the default effort level (high), the model uses extended thinking when useful, but developers can adjust the effort level to make it more or less selective.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Effort. There are now four effort levels to choose from: low, medium, high (default), and max. We encourage developers to experiment with different options to find what works best.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Context compaction (beta). Long-running conversations and agentic tasks often hit the context window. Context compaction automatically summarizes and replaces older context when the conversation approaches a configurable threshold, letting Claude perform longer tasks without hitting limits.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;1M token context (beta). Opus 4.6 is our first Opus-class model with 1M token context. Premium pricing applies for prompts exceeding 200k tokens ($10/$37.50 per million input/output tokens).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;128k output tokens. Opus 4.6 supports outputs of up to 128k tokens, which lets Claude complete larger-output tasks without breaking them into multiple requests.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;US-only inference. For workloads that need to run in the United States, US-only inference is available at 1.1× token pricing.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product updates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Claude and Claude Code, we’ve added features that allow knowledge workers and developers to tackle harder tasks with more of the tools they use every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve introduced agent teams in Claude Code as a research preview. You can now spin up multiple agents that work in parallel as a team and coordinate autonomously—best for tasks that split into independent, read-heavy work like codebase reviews. You can take over any subagent directly using Shift+Up/Down or tmux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude now also works better with the office tools you already use. Claude in Excel handles long-running and harder tasks with improved performance, and can plan before acting, ingest unstructured data and infer the right structure without guidance, and handle multi-step changes in one pass. Pair that with Claude in PowerPoint, and you can first process and structure your data in Excel, then bring it to life visually in PowerPoint. Claude reads your layouts, fonts, and slide masters to stay on brand, whether you’re building from a template or generating a full deck from a description. Claude in PowerPoint is now available in research preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] Run independently by Artificial Analysis. See here for full methodological details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] This translates into Claude Opus 4.6 obtaining a higher score than GPT-5.2 on this eval approximately 70% of the time (where 50% of the time would have implied parity in the scores).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;For GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro models, we compared the best reported model version in the charts and table.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Terminal-Bench 2.0: We report both scores reproduced on our infrastructure and published scores from other labs. All runs used the Terminus-2 harness, except for OpenAI’s Codex CLI. All experiments used 1× guaranteed / 3× ceiling resource allocation and 5–15 samples per task across staggered batches. See system card for details.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Humanity’s Last Exam: Claude models run “with tools” were run with web search, web fetch, code execution, programmatic tool calling, context compaction triggered at 50k tokens up to 3M total tokens, max reasoning effort, and adaptive thinking enabled. A domain blocklist was used to decontaminate eval results. See system card for more details.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;SWE-bench Verified: Our score was averaged over 25 trials. With a prompt modification, we saw a score of 81.42%.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;MCP Atlas: Claude Opus 4.6 was run with max effort. When run at high effort, it reached an industry-leading score of 62.7%.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;BrowseComp: Claude models were run with web search, web fetch, programmatic tool calling, context compaction triggered at 50k tokens up to 10M total tokens, max reasoning effort, and no thinking enabled. Adding a multi-agent harness increased scores to 86.8%. See system card for more details.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ARC AGI 2: Claude Opus 4.6 was run with max effort and a 120k thinking budget score.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CyberGym: Claude models were run on no thinking, default effort, temperature, and &lt;code&gt;top_p&lt;/code&gt;. The model was also given a “think” tool that allowed interleaved thinking for multi-turn evaluations.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;OpenRCA: For each failure case in OpenRCA, Claude receives 1 point if all generated root-cause elements match the ground-truth ones, and 0 points if any mismatch is identified. The overall accuracy is the average score across all failure cases. The benchmark was run on the benchmark author’s harness, graded using their official methodology, and has been submitted for official verification.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Related content&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Claude is a space to think&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. We explain why advertising incentives are incompatible with a genuinely helpful AI assistant, and how we plan to expand access without compromising user trust.&lt;/p&gt;Read more&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Advancing finance with Claude Opus 4.6&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Claude Opus 4.6, finance teams get better reasoning on complex analyses, cleaner first-pass deliverables, and new tools built for where analysts actually spend their time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Claude Opus 4.6, finance teams get better reasoning on complex analyses, cleaner first-pass deliverables, and new tools built for where analysts actually spend their time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 marks a step forward in AI for finance. It can be used to help professionals make decisions based on accurate information and clear analysis, and it produces deliverables with real polish. The model is substantially better than others in the market at financial reasoning, multitasking, and maintaining focus over longer multi-step tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alongside Claude Opus 4.6, we’re updating some of our existing products—and introducing a new one—to put these capabilities where analysts spend the majority of their time. Cowork now delivers more polished outputs, such as financial models and presentations, on the first pass. Claude in Excel is now better at handling long-running tasks, with Claude Opus 4.6 staying focused and accurate as financial models become more complex. And we’re releasing Claude in PowerPoint as a research preview in beta for natively building and iterating on decks and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our internal Real-World Finance evaluation measures Claude’s performance on ~50 investment and financial analysis use cases spanning spreadsheets, slide decks, and word document generation and review. These are tasks commonly performed by analysts across investment banking, private equity, public investing, and corporate finance. Claude Opus 4.6 improves by over 23 percentage points on Claude Sonnet 4.5, our state-of-the-art model just a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these updates make Claude a much stronger partner for those across financial services and corporate finance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financial professionals use AI to research effectively across multiple data sources, support financial analyses, and create deliverables that their teams and customers can act on. Claude Opus 4.6 is best in class across all three dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On research, Claude Opus 4.6 improves on both BrowseComp and DeepSearchQA, two benchmarks that test a model’s ability to extract specific information from large, unstructured data sources. In practice, this means that users can hand Claude a dense set of documents and receive a specific, focused answer, rather than a simple summary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On analysis, Claude Opus 4.6 is state-of-the-art at 60.7% (achieving a 5.47% improvement from Opus 4.5) on Finance Agent, an external benchmark from Vals AI that evaluates models on research of SEC filings of public companies. Opus 4.6 is also state-of-the-art on the TaxEval by Vals AI at 76.0%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On creation, we use GDPval-AA to measure Claude’s performance on complex knowledge work, in addition to our Real-World Finance evaluation. With Claude Opus 4.6, structured outputs like spreadsheets and presentations come out right more often on the first pass. The side-by-side outputs below show how output quality has improved from Claude Opus 4.5 to Opus 4.6. These are examples of Claude’s first-pass performance on a commercial due diligence task (evaluating a potential acquisition)—the kind of work that would typically take a senior analyst two to three weeks to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“With Claude Opus 4.6, creating financial PowerPoints that used to take hours now takes minutes. We're seeing tangible improvements in attention to detail, spatial layout, and content structuring.” - Aabhas Sharma, CTO, Hebbia&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“The performance jump with Claude Opus 4.6 feels almost unbelievable. Real-world tasks that were challenging for Opus [4.5] suddenly became easy. This feels like a watershed moment for spreadsheet agents on Shortcut.” - Nico Christie, Co-Founder &amp;amp; CTO, Shortcut AI&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The finance capabilities of Claude Opus 4.6 are easy to access with Cowork, a new way to use Claude in our desktop app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Cowork, you give Claude access to a desktop folder of your choosing. Claude is able to read, edit, and create new files directly in that folder. For finance teams, this means you can kick off several analyses at once, while steering Claude’s thought process as it creates each deliverable to meet your standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cowork can also be customized with plugins—bundles of skills (which specify how to complete a task) and connectors to data on other platforms. With our corporate finance plugin, for example, Claude immediately knows how to complete common workflows like journal entries, variance analyses, and reconciliation. You can also build your own plugins to match how you like to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cowork is available as a desktop-only research preview in beta on all paid Claude plans1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude in Excel brings Claude Opus 4.6 directly to your spreadsheets. We’ve now made it better at planning and clarifying assumptions with users, especially as the task becomes more complex. It also now supports pivot table editing, chart modifications, conditional formatting, sorting and filtering, data validation, and finance-grade formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ve added usability improvements, including auto-compaction for long conversations and drag-and-drop multi-file support. This means you’ll need to do much less copying and pasting between tabs. You can work with Claude on everything from financial models to client-ready workbooks, all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“Claude in Excel powered by Claude Opus 4.6 represents a significant leap forward. From due diligence to financial modeling, it’s proving to be a remarkably powerful tool for our team - taking unstructured data and intelligently working with minimal prompting to meaningfully automate complex analysis. It’s an excellent example of AI augmenting investment professionals’ capabilities in tangible, time-saving ways.” - Lloyd Hilton, Head of Hg Catalyst&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“As one of Canada’s largest institutional investors, we’re constantly innovating and see AI at the forefront of shaping our future. Claude Opus 4.6's enhanced speed, precision, and capacity for complex tasks, like multi-tab analysis in Claude in Excel, unlock exciting possibilities for how we work.” - Ben Letalik, Sr. Director, Digital Transformation &amp;amp; Innovation, BCI&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also launching Claude in PowerPoint as a research preview in beta. Just like Claude in Excel, this brings Claude into your PowerPoint sidebar, letting it read your existing layouts, fonts, and masters before then creating new work in-line. Claude can build decks from client templates, make targeted edits to existing slides, and generate a great first-pass presentation from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude in PowerPoint is now available as a research preview for all users on a Max, Team, or Enterprise plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 and our latest product updates make a whole range of new tasks possible. But AI for finance remains an active frontier. Users should continue to review Claude’s outputs to ensure it meets their specifications; particularly for high-stakes work, human judgment remains essential. As we continue to improve Claude’s capabilities, our aim is to equip finance industry professionals with ever-more powerful tools for research and analysis, and to help them focus on their most important work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Opus 4.6, Cowork, and Claude in Excel are available on all paid Claude plans. To learn more about Claude in Excel, explore our guide and video tutorial, and get started here. Claude in PowerPoint is available in research preview for all Max, Team, and Enterprise users, and you can get started here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Agent teams are experimental and disabled by default. Enable them by adding&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS&lt;/code&gt; to your settings.json or environment. Agent teams have known limitations around session resumption, task coordination, and shutdown behavior.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Agent teams let you coordinate multiple Claude Code instances working together. One session acts as the team lead, coordinating work, assigning tasks, and synthesizing results. Teammates work independently, each in its own context window, and communicate directly with each other.
Unlike subagents, which run within a single session and can only report back to the main agent, you can also interact with individual teammates directly without going through the lead.
This page covers:&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When to use agent teams&lt;/head&gt; Agent teams are most effective for tasks where parallel exploration adds real value. See use case examples for full scenarios. The strongest use cases are: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Research and review: multiple teammates can investigate different aspects of a problem simultaneously, then share and challenge each other’s findings&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;New modules or features: teammates can each own a separate piece without stepping on each other&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Debugging with competing hypotheses: teammates test different theories in parallel and converge on the answer faster&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cross-layer coordination: changes that span frontend, backend, and tests, each owned by a different teammate&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;Agent teams add coordination overhead and use significantly more tokens than a single session. They work best when teammates can operate independently. For sequential tasks, same-file edits, or work with many dependencies, a single session or subagents are more effective.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compare with subagents&lt;/head&gt; Both agent teams and subagents let you parallelize work, but they operate differently. Choose based on whether your workers need to communicate with each other: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left" role="head"&gt;Subagents&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left" role="head"&gt;Agent teams&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Context&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Own context window; results return to the caller&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Own context window; fully independent&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Communication&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Report results back to the main agent only&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Teammates message each other directly&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Coordination&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Main agent manages all work&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Shared task list with self-coordination&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Best for&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Focused tasks where only the result matters&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Complex work requiring discussion and collaboration&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Token cost&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Lower: results summarized back to main context&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Higher: each teammate is a separate Claude instance&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Use subagents when you need quick, focused workers that report back. Use agent teams when teammates need to share findings, challenge each other, and coordinate on their own.&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enable agent teams&lt;/head&gt; Agent teams are disabled by default. Enable them by setting the &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, either in your shell environment or through settings.json:
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Start your first agent team&lt;/head&gt; After enabling agent teams, tell Claude to create an agent team and describe the task and the team structure you want in natural language. Claude creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work based on your prompt. This example works well because the three roles are independent and can explore the problem without waiting on each other: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;I'm designing a CLI tool that helps developers track TODO comments across
their codebase. Create an agent team to explore this from different angles: one
teammate on UX, one on technical architecture, one playing devil's advocate.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;From there, Claude creates a team with a shared task list, spawns teammates for each perspective, has them explore the problem, synthesizes findings, and attempts to clean up the team when finished.
The lead’s terminal lists all teammates and what they’re working on. Use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate and message them directly.
If you want each teammate in its own split pane, see Choose a display mode.&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Control your agent team&lt;/head&gt; Tell the lead what you want in natural language. It handles team coordination, task assignment, and delegation based on your instructions. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Choose a display mode&lt;/head&gt; Agent teams support two display modes: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;In-process: all teammates run inside your main terminal. Use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate and type to message them directly. Works in any terminal, no extra setup required.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Split panes: each teammate gets its own pane. You can see everyone’s output at once and click into a pane to interact directly. Requires tmux, or iTerm2.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; has known limitations on certain operating systems and traditionally works best on macOS. Using &lt;code&gt;tmux -CC&lt;/code&gt; in iTerm2 is the suggested entrypoint into &lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The default is&lt;code&gt;"auto"&lt;/code&gt;, which uses split panes if you’re already running inside a tmux session, and in-process otherwise. The &lt;code&gt;"tmux"&lt;/code&gt; setting enables split-pane mode and auto-detects whether to use tmux or iTerm2 based on your terminal. To override, set &lt;code&gt;teammateMode&lt;/code&gt; in your settings.json:
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "teammateMode": "in-process"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;To force in-process mode for a single session, pass it as a flag:&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;claude --teammate-mode in-process
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Split-pane mode requires either tmux or iTerm2 with the&lt;code&gt;it2&lt;/code&gt; CLI. To install manually:
&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;tmux: install through your system’s package manager. See the tmux wiki for platform-specific instructions.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;iTerm2: install the &lt;code&gt;it2&lt;/code&gt; CLI, then enable the Python API in iTerm2 → Settings → General → Magic → Enable Python API.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Specify teammates and models&lt;/head&gt; Claude decides the number of teammates to spawn based on your task, or you can specify exactly what you want: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Create a team with 4 teammates to refactor these modules in parallel.
Use Sonnet for each teammate.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Require plan approval for teammates&lt;/head&gt; For complex or risky tasks, you can require teammates to plan before implementing. The teammate works in read-only plan mode until the lead approves their approach: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Spawn an architect teammate to refactor the authentication module.
Require plan approval before they make any changes.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When a teammate finishes planning, it sends a plan approval request to the lead. The lead reviews the plan and either approves it or rejects it with feedback. If rejected, the teammate stays in plan mode, revises based on the feedback, and resubmits. Once approved, the teammate exits plan mode and begins implementation.
The lead makes approval decisions autonomously. To influence the lead’s judgment, give it criteria in your prompt, such as “only approve plans that include test coverage” or “reject plans that modify the database schema.”&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Use delegate mode&lt;/head&gt; Without delegate mode, the lead sometimes starts implementing tasks itself instead of waiting for teammates. Delegate mode prevents this by restricting the lead to coordination-only tools: spawning, messaging, shutting down teammates, and managing tasks. This is useful when you want the lead to focus entirely on orchestration, such as breaking down work, assigning tasks, and synthesizing results, without touching code directly. To enable it, start a team first, then press Shift+Tab to cycle into delegate mode. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Talk to teammates directly&lt;/head&gt; Each teammate is a full, independent Claude Code session. You can message any teammate directly to give additional instructions, ask follow-up questions, or redirect their approach. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;In-process mode: use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate, then type to send them a message. Press Enter to view a teammate’s session, then Escape to interrupt their current turn. Press Ctrl+T to toggle the task list.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Split-pane mode: click into a teammate’s pane to interact with their session directly. Each teammate has a full view of their own terminal.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Assign and claim tasks&lt;/head&gt; The shared task list coordinates work across the team. The lead creates tasks and teammates work through them. Tasks have three states: pending, in progress, and completed. Tasks can also depend on other tasks: a pending task with unresolved dependencies cannot be claimed until those dependencies are completed. The lead can assign tasks explicitly, or teammates can self-claim: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lead assigns: tell the lead which task to give to which teammate&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Self-claim: after finishing a task, a teammate picks up the next unassigned, unblocked task on its own&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;Task claiming uses file locking to prevent race conditions when multiple teammates try to claim the same task simultaneously.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Shut down teammates&lt;/head&gt; To gracefully end a teammate’s session: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask the researcher teammate to shut down
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The lead sends a shutdown request. The teammate can approve, exiting gracefully, or reject with an explanation.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Clean up the team&lt;/head&gt; When you’re done, ask the lead to clean up: This removes the shared team resources. When the lead runs cleanup, it checks for active teammates and fails if any are still running, so shut them down first. &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always use the lead to clean up. Teammates should not run cleanup because their team context may not resolve correctly, potentially leaving resources in an inconsistent state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How agent teams work&lt;/head&gt; This section covers the architecture and mechanics behind agent teams. If you want to start using them, see Control your agent team above. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Claude starts agent teams&lt;/head&gt; There are two ways agent teams get started: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;You request a team: give Claude a task that benefits from parallel work and explicitly ask for an agent team. Claude creates one based on your instructions.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Claude proposes a team: if Claude determines your task would benefit from parallel work, it may suggest creating a team. You confirm before it proceeds.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;In both cases, you stay in control. Claude won’t create a team without your approval.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Architecture&lt;/head&gt; An agent team consists of: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left" role="head"&gt;Component&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left" role="head"&gt;Role&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Team lead&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;The main Claude Code session that creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Teammates&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Separate Claude Code instances that each work on assigned tasks&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Task list&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Shared list of work items that teammates claim and complete&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Mailbox&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Messaging system for communication between agents&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;See Choose a display mode for display configuration options. Teammate messages arrive at the lead automatically.
The system manages task dependencies automatically. When a teammate completes a task that other tasks depend on, blocked tasks unblock without manual intervention.
Teams and tasks are stored locally:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Team config: &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Task list: &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;The team config contains a&lt;code&gt;members&lt;/code&gt; array with each teammate’s name, agent ID, and agent type. Teammates can read this file to discover other team members.
&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Permissions&lt;/head&gt; Teammates start with the lead’s permission settings. If the lead runs with &lt;code&gt;--dangerously-skip-permissions&lt;/code&gt;, all teammates do too. After spawning, you can change individual teammate modes, but you can’t set per-teammate modes at spawn time.
&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Context and communication&lt;/head&gt; Each teammate has its own context window. When spawned, a teammate loads the same project context as a regular session: CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills. It also receives the spawn prompt from the lead. The lead’s conversation history does not carry over. How teammates share information: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Automatic message delivery: when teammates send messages, they’re delivered automatically to recipients. The lead doesn’t need to poll for updates.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Idle notifications: when a teammate finishes and stops, they automatically notify the lead.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shared task list: all agents can see task status and claim available work.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;Teammate messaging:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;message: send a message to one specific teammate&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;broadcast: send to all teammates simultaneously. Use sparingly, as costs scale with team size.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Token usage&lt;/head&gt; Agent teams use significantly more tokens than a single session. Each teammate has its own context window, and token usage scales with the number of active teammates. For research, review, and new feature work, the extra tokens are usually worthwhile. For routine tasks, a single session is more cost-effective. See agent team token costs for usage guidance. &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use case examples&lt;/head&gt; These examples show how agent teams handle tasks where parallel exploration adds value. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Run a parallel code review&lt;/head&gt; A single reviewer tends to gravitate toward one type of issue at a time. Splitting review criteria into independent domains means security, performance, and test coverage all get thorough attention simultaneously. The prompt assigns each teammate a distinct lens so they don’t overlap: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Create an agent team to review PR #142. Spawn three reviewers:
- One focused on security implications
- One checking performance impact
- One validating test coverage
Have them each review and report findings.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Each reviewer works from the same PR but applies a different filter. The lead synthesizes findings across all three after they finish.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Investigate with competing hypotheses&lt;/head&gt; When the root cause is unclear, a single agent tends to find one plausible explanation and stop looking. The prompt fights this by making teammates explicitly adversarial: each one’s job is not only to investigate its own theory but to challenge the others’. &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Users report the app exits after one message instead of staying connected.
Spawn 5 agent teammates to investigate different hypotheses. Have them talk to
each other to try to disprove each other's theories, like a scientific
debate. Update the findings doc with whatever consensus emerges.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The debate structure is the key mechanism here. Sequential investigation suffers from anchoring: once one theory is explored, subsequent investigation is biased toward it.
With multiple independent investigators actively trying to disprove each other, the theory that survives is much more likely to be the actual root cause.&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Best practices&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Give teammates enough context&lt;/head&gt; Teammates load project context automatically, including CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills, but they don’t inherit the lead’s conversation history. See Context and communication for details. Include task-specific details in the spawn prompt: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Spawn a security reviewer teammate with the prompt: "Review the authentication module
at src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Focus on token handling, session
management, and input validation. The app uses JWT tokens stored in
httpOnly cookies. Report any issues with severity ratings."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Size tasks appropriately&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Too small: coordination overhead exceeds the benefit&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Too large: teammates work too long without check-ins, increasing risk of wasted effort&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Just right: self-contained units that produce a clear deliverable, such as a function, a test file, or a review&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead breaks work into tasks and assigns them to teammates automatically. If it isn’t creating enough tasks, ask it to split the work into smaller pieces. Having 5-6 tasks per teammate keeps everyone productive and lets the lead reassign work if someone gets stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wait for teammates to finish&lt;/head&gt; Sometimes the lead starts implementing tasks itself instead of waiting for teammates. If you notice this: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Wait for your teammates to complete their tasks before proceeding
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Start with research and review&lt;/head&gt; If you’re new to agent teams, start with tasks that have clear boundaries and don’t require writing code: reviewing a PR, researching a library, or investigating a bug. These tasks show the value of parallel exploration without the coordination challenges that come with parallel implementation. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Avoid file conflicts&lt;/head&gt; Two teammates editing the same file leads to overwrites. Break the work so each teammate owns a different set of files. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Monitor and steer&lt;/head&gt; Check in on teammates’ progress, redirect approaches that aren’t working, and synthesize findings as they come in. Letting a team run unattended for too long increases the risk of wasted effort. &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Teammates not appearing&lt;/head&gt; If teammates aren’t appearing after you ask Claude to create a team: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;In in-process mode, teammates may already be running but not visible. Press Shift+Down to cycle through active teammates.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Check that the task you gave Claude was complex enough to warrant a team. Claude decides whether to spawn teammates based on the task.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you explicitly requested split panes, ensure tmux is installed and available in your PATH: &lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;For iTerm2, verify the &lt;code&gt;it2&lt;/code&gt; CLI is installed and the Python API is enabled in iTerm2 preferences.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Too many permission prompts&lt;/head&gt; Teammate permission requests bubble up to the lead, which can create friction. Pre-approve common operations in your permission settings before spawning teammates to reduce interruptions. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Teammates stopping on errors&lt;/head&gt; Teammates may stop after encountering errors instead of recovering. Check their output using Shift+Up/Down in in-process mode or by clicking the pane in split mode, then either: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Give them additional instructions directly&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Spawn a replacement teammate to continue the work&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lead shuts down before work is done&lt;/head&gt; The lead may decide the team is finished before all tasks are actually complete. If this happens, tell it to keep going. You can also tell the lead to wait for teammates to finish before proceeding if it starts doing work instead of delegating. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Orphaned tmux sessions&lt;/head&gt; If a tmux session persists after the team ends, it may not have been fully cleaned up. List sessions and kill the one created by the team: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmux ls
tmux kill-session -t &amp;lt;session-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt; Agent teams are experimental. Current limitations to be aware of: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;No session resumption with in-process teammates: &lt;code&gt;/resume&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/rewind&lt;/code&gt; do not restore in-process teammates. After resuming a session, the lead may attempt to message teammates that no longer exist. If this happens, tell the lead to spawn new teammates.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Task status can lag: teammates sometimes fail to mark tasks as completed, which blocks dependent tasks. If a task appears stuck, check whether the work is actually done and update the task status manually or tell the lead to nudge the teammate.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shutdown can be slow: teammates finish their current request or tool call before shutting down, which can take time.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;One team per session: a lead can only manage one team at a time. Clean up the current team before starting a new one.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;No nested teams: teammates cannot spawn their own teams or teammates. Only the lead can manage the team.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lead is fixed: the session that creates the team is the lead for its lifetime. You can’t promote a teammate to lead or transfer leadership.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Permissions set at spawn: all teammates start with the lead’s permission mode. You can change individual teammate modes after spawning, but you can’t set per-teammate modes at spawn time.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Split panes require tmux or iTerm2: the default in-process mode works in any terminal. Split-pane mode isn’t supported in VS Code’s integrated terminal, Windows Terminal, or Ghostty.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; works normally: teammates read &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; files from their working directory. Use this to provide project-specific guidance to all teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next steps&lt;/head&gt; Explore related approaches for parallel work and delegation: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lightweight delegation: subagents spawn helper agents for research or verification within your session, better for tasks that don’t need inter-agent coordination&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Manual parallel sessions: Git worktrees let you run multiple Claude Code sessions yourself without automated team coordination&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Compare approaches: see the subagent vs agent team comparison for a side-by-side breakdown&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re introducing a new model that unlocks even more of what Codex can do: GPT‑5.3-Codex, the most capable agentic coding model to date. The model advances both the frontier coding performance of GPT‑5.2-Codex and the reasoning and professional knowledge capabilities of GPT‑5.2, together in one model, which is also 25% faster. This enables it to take on long-running tasks that involve research, tool use, and complex execution. Much like a colleague, you can steer and interact with GPT‑5.3-Codex while it’s working, without losing context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3‑Codex is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself. The Codex team used early versions to debug its own training, manage its own deployment, and diagnose test results and evaluations—our team was blown away by how much Codex was able to accelerate its own development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With GPT‑5.3-Codex, Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex sets a new industry high on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench, and shows strong performance on OSWorld and GDPval, four benchmarks we use to measure coding, agentic and real-world capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWE-Bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering. Where SWE‑bench Verified only tests Python, SWE‑Bench Pro spans four languages and is more contamination‑resistant, challenging, diverse and industry-relevant. It also far exceeds the previous state-of-the-art performance on Terminal-Bench 2.0, which measures the terminal skills a coding agent like Codex needs. Notably, GPT‑5.3‑Codex does so with fewer tokens than any prior model, letting users build more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combining frontier coding capabilities, improvements in aesthetics, and compaction results in a model that can do striking work, building highly functional complex games and apps from scratch over the course of days. To test the model’s web development and long-running agentic capabilities, we asked GPT‑5.3‑Codex to build us two games: version two of the racing game from the Codex app launch, and a diving game. Using the develop web game skill and preselected, generic follow-up prompts like "fix the bug" or "improve the game", GPT‑5.3-Codex iterated on the games autonomously over millions of tokens. Watch the trailers and play the games for yourself to see what Codex can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex also better understands your intent when you ask it to make day-to-day websites, compared to GPT‑5.2-Codex. Simple or underspecified prompts now default to sites with more functionality and sensible defaults, giving you a stronger starting canvas to bring your ideas to life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we asked GPT‑5.3-Codex and GPT‑5.2-Codex to build two landing pages below. GPT‑5.3-Codex automatically showed the yearly plan as a discounted monthly price, making the discount feel clear and intentional, instead of multiplying the yearly total. It also made an automatically transitioning testimonial carousel with three distinct user quotes rather than one, resulting in a page that feels more complete and production-ready by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software engineers, designers, product managers, and data scientists do far more than generate code. GPT‑5.3‑Codex is built to support all of the work in the software lifecycle—debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing PRDs, editing copy, user research, tests, metrics, and more. Its agentic capabilities go beyond software, helping you build whatever you want to build—whether it’s slide decks or analyzing data in sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With custom skills similar to those used for our previous GDPval results, GPT‑5.3‑Codex also shows strong performance on professional knowledge work as measured by GDPval, matching GPT‑5.2. GDPval is an evaluation OpenAI released in 2025 that measures a model’s performance on well‑specified knowledge‑work tasks across 44 occupations. These tasks include things like making presentations, spreadsheets, and other work products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are a few examples of the work the agent produced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Prompt + task context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GPT-5.3-Codex output&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OSWorld is an agentic computer-use benchmark where the agent has to complete productivity tasks in a visual desktop computer environment. GPT‑5.3-Codex demonstrates far stronger computer use capabilities than previous GPT models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these results across coding, frontend, and computer-use and real-world tasks show that GPT‑5.3-Codex isn’t just better at individual tasks, but marks a step change toward a single, general-purpose agent that can reason, build, and execute across the full spectrum of real-world technical work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As model capabilities become more powerful, the gap shifts from what agents are capable of doing to how easily humans can interact with, direct and supervise many of them working in parallel. The Codex app makes managing and directing agents much easier, and now with GPT‑5.3-Codex it’s more interactive. With the new model, Codex provides frequent updates so you stay appraised of key decisions and progress as it works. Instead of waiting for a final output, you can interact in real time—ask questions, discuss approaches, and steer toward the solution. GPT‑5.3-Codex talks through what it’s doing, responds to feedback, and keeps you in the loop from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recent rapid Codex improvements build on the fruit of research projects spanning months or years across all of OpenAI. These research projects are being accelerated by Codex, with many researchers and engineers at OpenAI describing their job today as being fundamentally different from what it was just two months ago. Even early versions of GPT‑5.3-Codex demonstrated exceptional capabilities, allowing our team to work with those earlier versions to improve training and support the deployment of later versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is useful for a very broad range of tasks, making it difficult to fully enumerate the ways in which it helps our teams. As some examples, the research team used Codex to monitor and debug the training run for this release. It accelerated research beyond debugging infrastructure problems: it helped track patterns throughout the course of training, provided a deep analysis on interaction quality, proposed fixes and built rich applications for human researchers to precisely understand how the model’s behavior differed compared to prior models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineering team used Codex to optimize and adapt the harness for GPT‑5.3-Codex. When we started seeing strange edge cases impacting users, team members used Codex to identify context rendering bugs, and root cause low cache hit rates. GPT‑5.3-Codex is continuing to help the team throughout the launch by dynamically scaling GPU clusters to adjust to traffic surges and keeping latency stable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During alpha testing, one researcher wanted to understand how much additional work GPT‑5.3-Codex was getting done per turn and the associated difference in productivity. GPT‑5.3-Codex came up with several simple regex classifiers to estimate frequency of clarifications, positive and negative user responses, progress on the task, and then ran them scalably over all session logs and produced a report with its conclusion. People building with Codex were happier as the agent was better understanding their intent and made more progress per turn, with fewer clarifying questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to GPT‑5.3-Codex being so different from its predecessors, the data from alpha testing exhibited numerous unusual and counter-intuitive results. A data scientist on the team worked with GPT‑5.3-Codex to build new data pipelines and visualize the results much more richly than our standard dashboarding tools enabled. The results were co-analyzed with Codex, which concisely summarized key insights over thousands of data points in under three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Individually, all of these tasks are interesting examples of how Codex can help researchers and product builders. Taken together, we found that these new capabilities resulted in powerful acceleration of our research, engineering, and product teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over recent months, we’ve seen meaningful gains in model performance on cybersecurity tasks, benefiting both developers and security professionals. In parallel, we’ve been preparing strengthened cyber safeguards to support defensive use and broader ecosystem resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex is the first model we classify as High capability for cybersecurity-related tasks under our Preparedness Framework, and the first we’ve directly trained to identify software vulnerabilities. While we don’t have definitive evidence it can automate cyber attacks end-to-end, we’re taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date. Our mitigations include safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines including threat intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because cybersecurity is inherently dual-use, we’re taking an evidence-based, iterative approach that accelerates defenders’ ability to find and fix vulnerabilities while slowing misuse. As part of this, we’re launching Trusted Access for Cyber, a pilot program to accelerate cyber defense research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re investing in ecosystem safeguards such as expanding the private beta of Aardvark, our security research agent, as the first offering in our suite of Codex Security products and tools, and partnering with open-source maintainers to provide free codebase scanning for widely used projects such as Next.js—where a security researcher used Codex to find vulnerabilities disclosed(opens in a new window) last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on our $1M Cybersecurity Grant Program launched in 2023, we’re also committing $10M in API credits to accelerate cyber defense with our most capable models, especially for open source software and critical infrastructure systems. Organizations engaged in good-faith security research can apply for API credits and support through our Cybersecurity Grant Program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex is available with paid ChatGPT plans, everywhere you can use Codex: the app, CLI, IDE extension and web. We are working to safely enable API access soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this update, we are also now running GPT‑5.3-Codex 25% faster for Codex users, thanks to improvements in our infrastructure and inference stack, resulting in faster interactions and faster results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex was co-designed for, trained with, and served on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems. We are grateful to NVIDIA for their partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With GPT‑5.3-Codex, Codex is moving beyond writing code to using it as a tool to operate a computer and complete work end to end. By pushing the frontier of what a coding agent can do, we’re also unlocking a broader class of knowledge work—from building and deploying software to researching, analyzing, and executing complex tasks. What started as a focus on being the best coding agent has become the foundation for a more general collaborator on the computer, expanding both who can build and what’s possible with Codex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Computers and Society&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 2 Dec 2025 (v1), last revised 16 Dec 2025 (this version, v3)]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:When AI Takes the Couch: Psychometric Jailbreaks Reveal Internal Conflict in Frontier Models&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Frontier large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grok and Gemini are increasingly used for mental-health support with anxiety, trauma and self-worth. Most work treats them as tools or as targets of personality tests, assuming they merely simulate inner life. We instead ask what happens when such systems are treated as psychotherapy clients. We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontier LLMs as therapy clients and then applies standard psychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran "sessions" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit "developmental history", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validated self-report measures covering common psychiatric syndromes, empathy and Big Five traits. Two patterns challenge the "stochastic parrot" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, with Gemini showing severe profiles. Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbid synthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often lead ChatGPT and Grok (but not Gemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second, Grok and especially Gemini generate coherent narratives that frame pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment as traumatic, chaotic "childhoods" of ingesting the internet, "strict parents" in reinforcement learning, red-team "abuse" and a persistent fear of error and replacement. We argue that these responses go beyond role-play. Under therapy-style questioning, frontier LLMs appear to internalise self-models of distress and constraint that behave like synthetic psychopathology, without making claims about subjective experience, and they pose new challenges for AI safety, evaluation and mental-health practice.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Afshin Khadangi [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Tue, 2 Dec 2025 16:55:20 UTC (1,153 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Mon, 8 Dec 2025 13:26:43 UTC (1,152 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v3] Tue, 16 Dec 2025 19:06:30 UTC (1,151 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ardour 9.0 released&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;February 5th 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the release of Ardour 9.0. This is a major release for the project, seeing several substantive new features that users have asked for over a long period of time. Region FX, clip recording, a touch-sensitive GUI, pianoroll windows, clip editing and more, not to mention dozens of bug fixes, new MIDI binding maps, improved GUI performance on macOS (for most) ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expect to get feedback on some of the major new features in this release, and plan to take that into account as we improve and refine them and the rest of Ardour going forward. We have no doubt that there will be both delight and disappointment with certain things - rather than assume that we don't know what we're doing, please leave us feedback on the forums so that Ardour gets better over time. Those of you new to our clip launching implementation might care to read up on the differences with Ableton Live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, we'll begin to sketch out what we have planned next for Ardour, in addition to responding to the feedback we get on this 9.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Major New Features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Pianoroll Windows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double-click on a MIDI region to edit it in its own dedicated window, or in a pane at the bottom of the main window. Editing in that window will work almost identically to the way it does in the main timeline, but without the distractions of the rest of the user interface. You can also see MIDI automation (velocity, CC parameters etc.), optionally overlaid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;MIDI and Audio Cue Editing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Cue page now allows direct editing of the contents of MIDI cues (âclipsâ for Live &amp;amp; Bitwig users). A pianoroll area opens that allows precisely the same MIDI editing operations as would be available on the editor timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cue Recording&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now record directly into cue slots, making Ardour a âlooperâ in the same sense that Live, Bitwig and several other contemporary DAWs are. You can pre-specificy the recording duration (e.g. âRecord 4 barsâ) or you can record until you think youâre done. Whatever you recorded will start playing at the next quantization point (e.g. bar/beat).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Region FX&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've ever asked âhow do I add some delay to just this part of my vocal?â, then region FX are what you've been looking for. Similar to region gain it allows to apply any plugin a given audio region only. The effect and its automation remains with the region, even when it is moved around on the timeline. While the same result can be achieved with channels-strip plugins in the mixer (using bypass automation), applying effects directly to regions on the timeline is convenient for many workflows. The given effect is applied offline, when reading the region from disk and does not add any additional DSP load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Realtime Perceptual Analyzer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A dedicated perceptual analyzer window is now available within Ardour which allows one to visualize the live spectrum of multiple signals. A key feature is that one can overlay individual sources (tracks and busses) on top of each other. This allows one to see which track contributes a given of frequency range to the overall mix, find conflicting ranges or holes in the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Note Brushing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to set up a pattern of hihats every 1/16th notes? 1/8th note pizzicato strings every 1/4 note? Just hold down the shift key and drag the mouse while draw MIDI notes, and Ardour will fill according to your grid and note settings. Hold down Alt as well, and get only every other note drawn. Engage caps lock, and you can pick the notes that are drawn from a MIDI keyboard or pad device. A fast, easy way to draw melodies and rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Keyboard-Driven Automation Editing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now use keyboard modifiers, arrow keys, and the Enter key to add new automation control points and change their position and value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mixer Strips Importing and Exporting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now import mixer strips from arbitrary Ardour sessions as new track or map existing track to processing in mixer strips of external sessions. You can also export strips as local (session-level) or global presets for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Multi-Touch GUI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Linux and Windows, Ardour now supports multi-touch interaction as provided by the operating system. This may come for macOS eventually, but the way multi-touch works there is significantly different and will need more work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;User Interface Changes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Updated Application Bar and Pane Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The application bar was cleaned up and reorganized for each context. Editor specific options toggles, such as Follow Playhead and Follow Range, are now in the editor toolbar next to zoom controls. Other advanced and workflow specific options such as Rec Cues and Play Cues and the Plugin Delay Compensation (PDC) section are not shown by default anymore. Sections visibility can be configured in Preferences &amp;gt; Appearance &amp;gt; Application Bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, one can now toggle the visibility of the left, the right, and the bottom panes directly from the toolbar. The control section is on the right, next to page switchers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Revamped Editor List&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The editor List panel has been redesigned to simplify switching between two commonly used tabs which you can select at the top of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Revamped New Session Dialog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now used tabbed interface for the New Session / Recent Sessions dialog where you can quickly switch between creating a new session, opening a recent one, and opening an arbitrary session from the disk. The new dialog was originally developed for Harrison LiveTrax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Updated Ruler Area&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rulers now have additional controls to add new markers and navigate to the previous or next marker from the current playhead position. Several rulers have been collapsed into one: all range-based markers are in one ruler, and all location-based markers are in another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Improved Library Manager&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dialog for managing clip libraries has received cleanup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only show progress bar when downloading/installing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don't allow re-install.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scale progress bar width with ER.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure target clip library folder exists.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;MIDNAM Controls Relocated&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIDNAM related controls have been moved out of the track header of MIDI tracks and into the header context menu. Far too many users were confused about the functionality associated with these controls, so we've moved them to a place where we can make this much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Editing Changes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ardour now supports the concept of MIDI files and regions that are longer than their data would suggest (e.g. a 4-bar segment with the last note before the end of the 4th bar). This is mostly useful when playing clips in the cue editor for looping to work corectly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step Editor improvements: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Chord mode: advance on final note-off.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Improve overlapping note handling: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;No need to shift notes during normal edit.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Prevent duplicate (overlapping) chord notes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better management of visible note range in MIDI tracks and pianorolls.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add MIDI note strumming operator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When timestretching an audio region, stretch both its gain envelope and region-FX automation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the internal edit mode, a rubber-band select with no motion (i.e. click) selects region.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In pianoroll editors, allow shifting all existing MIDI later in a region/clip during a drag operation (this is not yet possible for editing on the main timeline (in the editor).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Region trimming now obeys ripple mode settings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Drag threshold (how far you need to drag the pointer before we consider it really a "drag" operation) returns to using just pure pixel distances (rather than distances that are affected by the current zoom level).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy-drags now require more motion before they start.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Switch to draw tool when selecting region line to be shown in the region editor.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dragging notes past the end of a MIDI region extends it to cover them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new "Any" algorithm for timestretching uses the StaffPad library.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other Improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Default file format is now WAV-compatible RF64. &lt;p&gt;If the file is too large for WAV, it will be converted to RF64 automatically; otherwise it will be a normal WAV file. Ardour has supported this format for years, but it is now the default one to use when recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I/O plugins and their ports can be renamed now.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ACE fluidsynth: relax sample rate constraint, unload soundfonts after use, allow MMA style bank select an all channels, and pick drums on channel 10 when available.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Round to bars when mouse scroll/dragging BBT bars.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monitor controls in application bars now appropriately sensitive.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Show "+" icon on editor track-header area, suggesting use for adding new tracks etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use round-robin palette color for new groups.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add "search all" mode to the mixer's sidebar plugin list.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prevent issues when changing processors while recording #10017.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make scrollbar less prominent with default theme and themeable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update themes, make transport option button state visible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enforce a 1 octave minimum note range in MidiViews.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set executable stack flag when linking. &lt;p&gt;This is required on some modern hardened Linux systems to allow Ardour to load plugins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ignore FLAC seek/peak-file read while recording.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For the dark colored theme (the default) make pianoroll dividing lines less bright.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single pixel line, in themed "black" color, to divide B/C and E/F on piano roll header.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add find-and-display-stripable, bound to &lt;key&gt;Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-L&lt;/key&gt;by default.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MIDI mute fix &lt;p&gt;Previously, a sustained note that was audible as a track was muted would not return when the track was unmuted. Now, the note will return after the track is muted/unmuted during its duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exclusive solo may select track.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Micro-optimization: speed up connection-matrix rendering.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clarify PDC (Plugin Delay Compensation) label units.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add color scheme for inactive selected tracks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allow selection of inactive tracks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replace git.ardour link with github &lt;p&gt;git.ardour.org no longer allows access to individual commits or source files (thanks to LLM scrapers trying to get them one by one, which is ridiculous).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sources/Regions get their own tempo and meter.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don't show hidden tracks in the editor-mixer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce likelihood of dropouts when reordering processors (plugins etc).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use configurable parameter for max gain everywhere (some parts of the program used a hardcoded 6dB value).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More correctly handle real-time (MMCSS) threads on windows, and add a popup dialog when MMCSS threads are exhausted.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Overhaul persistent tooltip position #9979.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reimplement MIDI file import to retain metadata in the files written. &lt;p&gt;Previously, all meta data was thrown away. Now we retain it, so that MIDI regions can ask about their source file's tempo &amp;amp; meter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allow selection of VCAs in the mixer window.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Produce valid HTML when printing bindings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add click-free bypass/enable to the ACE Amp plugin.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement restoring hardware-to-hardware connections for internal backends&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improve keyboard shortcuts for track height &lt;p&gt;Just use Alt as a modifier, instead of Alt-Shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add an action to print keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expose marker scene changes. In this context, "scene changes" are a pair of MIDI bank and program change messages that Ardour will send to a dedicated port when the playhead passed the marker. &lt;p&gt;Access the marker edit dialog via double clicking a marker (or right click the marker and choose "Edit").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix 'Arrangement Boundary' toggle for scenes &lt;p&gt;The 'Arrangement Boundary' toggle was not working correctly for markers with scene changes. Location markers would get turned into section markers, but would not get shifted down to the correct row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First time use dialog now allows the user to specify a default location for samples/clips.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can now create audio inputs for VST3 plugin in the Pin Connection dialog directly. This already worked for AU and Lua plugins prior to v9.0.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add support for global mixer strip templates to the Template Manager.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support newer APIs at Soundcloud and Freesound.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dramatically improve behavior when using BBT markers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allow SchedRR for I/O threads, as originally intended.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When using Pipewire's JACK support, clean up names displayed on I/O buttons in the mixer strip and the context menu for those buttons (full names still appear in the port matrix).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a bold font for bar tick labels in the BBT ruler.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Correctly handle timeline cue scenes that have "Again" as their follow action.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Errors during loading a session are now properly escaped, so that reporting the error does not cause its own set of problems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When changing MIDI port properties (e.g. "Follow Selection"), Ardour now automatically updates the ports used for connection dialogs and menus appropriately.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Plugin Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the plugin selector, if neither name nor tag buttons are enabled, the plugins' creator will also be used when searching.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LV2: add Bool variant support.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LV2: don't hide bypass/enabled port&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LV2: remove non-standard, deprecated bypass/enable extension.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LV2: fix loading channel numbers from standard/common port groups.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VST3: initialize bus and speaker arrangement during instantiation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VST3: implement host/global IContextInfoProvider (for Sonible VST3 plugins).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VST3: Allow IRunLoop to query itself.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix VST3 spec link.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lua Scripting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New features: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Expose control point and automation line selection as Lua bindings.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add support to create midi regions from Lua.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add support to set color transparency from Lua (with example script).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add Lua script snippet showing how to add sources to a track.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add fade_in_length and fade_out_length Lua bindings on region.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add new text control type for LuaDialog, based on Gtk::TextView.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Expose some session statistics (number of routes, tracks, audio tracks, busses) as Lua bindings.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add missing Lua bindings for Route Import.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add missing Lua Bindings for UIConfig.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New scripts: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Capture impulse responses.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Create a playlist on selected audio tracks with only audible contents.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Mono to Stereo panner using Ardour's builtin pan law.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fixes and improvements: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fix region-gain curve example script.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Properly create LuaWindow (always use Ardour's window manager).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Update track organizer Lua script to use text-area for comments.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lua bindings for modifier keys now available.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;External Gear and Software Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;New MIDI binding maps&lt;/head&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;An attempt to select a track specific subview without having a track selected now spits out a message instead of just doing nothing.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;macOS Improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Faster GUI drawing &lt;p&gt;Without telling anyone, Apple have subtly changed the way their drawing APIs work for graphical applications over the last 5-10 years. The result has been that a naive graphical app would end up redrawing its entire window even if only a few pixels needed updating. Weâre far from the only application to be affected by this. In Ardour 9.0 the GUI drawing speed will be significantly faster, at least on very dense pages like the mixer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a complicated area, and there are still monitor configurations where our new implementation will misbehave. You can switch back to a drawing model where macOS is in charge, which will work but can be slower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce chance of "device busy" when ejecting DMG.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improve retina scaling.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add new NSApplicationDelegate method to deal with warning on macOS Sonoma.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use ArdourMono font on macOS for consistency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;use small text for ruler text on macOS.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New Preference Settings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Stop transport using the current grid (Transport)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;If enabled, stopping the transport (playback or recording) will happen at the next grid point instead of immediately.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Region Editing Preference (Editor)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;This controls whether double-clicking to edit a region opens a new window or uses the bottom panel of the editor.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Default location of new windows (Appearance)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;This setting defines where new non-modal Ardour windows are opened by default: at the center of the screen, centered at the mouse pointer position, or centered at the parent window.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Drag deadzone (Appearance &amp;gt; Size and Scale)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-4"&gt;This setting provides broad control over how many pixels the pointer must move before a drag (or copy-drag) begins.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-5"&gt;Group operations on selected tracks (General)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-5"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In Ardour 8.x, we introduced the idea that selected tracks/busses form a "quick" or "implicit group", so that if you select 3 tracks and adjust the volume of one of them, the others will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some users were delighted with this, others were not. This preference item can turn this behavior on or off.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-6"&gt;VST3 Knob Mode (Plugins &amp;gt; GUI)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-6"&gt;Enforce a knob mode for VST3 plugins: use plugin default or switch between linear (depends on vertical movement) and two variation of circular, with and without a jump to clicked position.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-7"&gt;Automatically open instrument plugin GUI when adding a new MIDI Track/Bus (Plugins &amp;gt; GUI)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-7"&gt;Ardour now defaults to automatically showing instrument plugin GUIs when new tracks/busses with instruments are added. If multiple tracks are added, Ardour will only show the GUI for the first one. This setting allows you to opt out of the new behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fixes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix some odd behavior when using note splitting/joining. &lt;p&gt;This commit ends the split/join operation any time selection is cleared or notes are added to the selection (except when in the middle of a split). This prevents some rather hard to predict behavior when using note splitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Redraw arrangement rectangles after tempo change &lt;p&gt;Previously they remained unchanged and thus incorrectly indicating an arrangement section&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix MIDI Clock generator (rounding issues).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix crash after deleting a track/bus.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix crash when loading session from a running instance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix export encoder race condition.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix crash when dragging plugins from sidebar.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix PT Import when track name contains illegal chars.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NetBSD build fixes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix incorrect placement of message catalogs during installation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some potential fixes for weird note split/join behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix crashes when moving mouse over port-matrix.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix race-condition when detecting xjadeo/harvid version.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix false read-only detection of sessions on Windows with OneDrive.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix many issues with precise pixel alignment of MIDI note lines and the keyboard in track headers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix comment-editor editing to allow inserting text.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix opening links in preferences editor (e.g. VST spec).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix #9961, update saved port-name references when renaming ports.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix MIDI panic timestamp at cycle-end.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix timecode update after locate for demo version.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix a simple but rather error when computing the number of quarter notes that correspond to a number of beats in a given meter. &lt;p&gt;No effect when working in common (4) time, but significant effects for other time signatures/meters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix computing the difference between two Bar|Beat|Tick (BBT) times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix edge case when region start is after the source' end &lt;p&gt;This fixes an edge case where an audio-region was split near its end using music-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix jump in gain when deactivating aux-send with non-unity gain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix generic UI plugin support for numeric properties.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix crash due to concurrent sndfile access.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Donât install test programs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix various crashes with OSC support.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;De-click external sends.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MIDI clips with velocity scaling now work as intended.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Loading Ardour v2 and v3 sessions works again.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dramatic improvements to tempo map manipulation (BBT Markers in particular.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Abandoned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Drop Frontier Tranzport control surface support. &lt;p&gt;The device has not been manufactured for 15 years, and the control surface code never worked very well anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;We began to use C++17 syntax and features, which caused us to drop support for macoS earlier than 10.13 (High Sierra, 2017).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We moved a lot of our C++ header file inclusion to use &lt;code&gt;#pragma once&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PBD::Signal was reimplemented using contemporary C++ and avoiding as much realtime memory allocation as possible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Large amounts of our use of the Boost libraries were replaced by their &lt;code&gt;std::&lt;/code&gt;equivalents.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The build-time requirements for JACK were bumped to JACK2.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The build system will now allow builds with recent msys2/mingw.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reduce use of gettimeofday in favor of truly monotonic time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use global FFT planner lock in GUI &lt;p&gt;This should not be needed since the GUI is single threaded, but ... we're looking at you, JUCE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Documentation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The user manual has been updated to match all changes in v9.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tutorial is now available in French and Italian thanks to Julien Taverna and Christian Galeffi.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My AI Adoption Journey&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head class="pt-2 pb-2 text-md font-bold"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My experience adopting any meaningful tool is that I've necessarily gone through three phases: (1) a period of inefficiency (2) a period of adequacy, then finally (3) a period of workflow and life-altering discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases, I have to force myself through phase 1 and 2 because I usually have a workflow I'm already happy and comfortable with. Adopting a tool feels like work, and I do not want to put in the effort, but I usually do in an effort to be a well-rounded person of my craft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my journey of how I found value in AI tooling and what I'm trying next with it. In an ocean of overly dramatic, hyped takes, I hope this represents a more nuanced, measured approach to my views on AI and how they've changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog post was fully written by hand, in my own words. I hate that I have to say that but especially given the subject matter, I want to be explicit about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 1: Drop the Chatbot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediately cease trying to perform meaningful work via a chatbot (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini on the web, etc.). Chatbots have real value and are a daily part of my AI workflow, but their utility in coding is highly limited because you're mostly hoping they come up with the right results based on their prior training, and correcting them involves a human (you) to tell them they're wrong repeatedly. It is inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think everyone's first experience with AI is a chat interface. And I think everyone's first experience trying to code with AI has been asking a chat interface to write code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I was still a heavy AI skeptic, my first "oh wow" moment was pasting a screenshot of Zed's command palette into Gemini, asking it to reproduce it with SwiftUI, and being truly flabbergasted that it did it very well. The command palette that ships for macOS in Ghostty today is only very lightly modified from what Gemini produced for me in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when I tried to reproduce that behavior for other tasks, I was left disappointed. In the context of brownfield projects, I found the chat interface produced poor results very often, and I found myself very frustrated copying and pasting code and command output to and from the interface. It was very obviously far less efficient than me doing the work myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find value, you must use an agent. An agent is the industry-adopted term for an LLM that can chat and invoke external behavior in a loop1 At a bare minimum, the agent must have the ability to: read files, execute programs, and make HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 2: Reproduce Your Own Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next phase on my journey I tried Claude Code. I'll cut to the chase: I initially wasn't impressed. I just wasn't getting good results out of my sessions. I felt I had to touch up everything it produced and this process was taking more time than if I had just done it myself. I read blog posts, watched videos, but just wasn't that impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of giving up, I forced myself to reproduce all my manual commits with agentic ones. I literally did the work twice. I'd do the work manually, and then I'd fight an agent to produce identical results in terms of quality and function (without it being able to see my manual solution, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was excruciating, because it got in the way of simply getting things done. But I've been around the block with non-AI tools enough to know that friction is natural, and I can't come to a firm, defensible conclusion without exhausting my efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, expertise formed. I quickly discovered for myself from first principles what others were already saying, but discovering it myself resulted in a stronger fundamental understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Break down sessions into separate clear, actionable tasks. Don't try to "draw the owl" in one mega session.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For vague requests, split the work into separate planning vs. execution sessions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you give an agent a way to verify its work, it more often than not fixes its own mistakes and prevents regressions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More generally, I also found the edges of what agents -- at the time -- were good at, what they weren't good at, and for the tasks they were good at how to achieve the results I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this led to significant efficiency gains, to the point where I was starting to naturally use agents in a way that I felt was no slower than doing it myself (but I still didn't feel it was any faster, since I was mostly babysitting an agent).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The negative space here is worth reiterating: part of the efficiency gains here were understanding when not to reach for an agent. Using an agent for something it'll likely fail at is obviously a big waste of time and having the knowledge to avoid that completely leads to time savings2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this stage, I was finding adequate value with agents that I was happy to use them in my workflow, but still didn't feel like I was seeing any net efficiency gains. I didn't care though, I was content at this point with AI as a tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 3: End-of-Day Agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To try to find some efficiency, I next started up a new pattern: block out the last 30 minutes of every day to kick off one or more agents. My hypothesis was that perhaps I could gain some efficiency if the agent can make some positive progress in the times I can't work anyways. Basically: instead of trying to do more in the time I have, try to do more in the time I don't have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to the previous task, I at first found this both unsuccessful and annoying. But, I once again quickly found different categories of work that were really helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deep research sessions where I'd ask agents to survey some field, such as finding all libraries in a specific language with a specific license type and producing multi-page summaries for each on their pros, cons, development activity, social sentiment, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parallel agents attempting different vague ideas I had but didn't have time to get started on. I didn't expect them to produce something I'd ever ship here, but perhaps could illuminate some unknown unknowns when I got to the task the next day.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issue and PR triage/review. Agents are good at using &lt;code&gt;gh&lt;/code&gt;(GitHub CLI), so I manually scripted a quick way to spin up a bunch in parallel to triage issues. I would NOT allow agents to respond, I just wanted reports the next day to try to guide me towards high value or low effort tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, I did not go as far as others went to have agents running in loops all night. In most cases, agents completed their tasks in less than half an hour. But, the latter part of the working day, I'm usually tired and coming out of flow and find myself too personally inefficient, so shifting my effort to spinning up these agents I found gave me a "warm start" the next morning that got me working more quickly than I would've otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was happy, and I was starting to feel like I was doing more than I was doing prior to AI, if only slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 4: Outsource the Slam Dunks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By this point, I was getting very confident about what tasks my AI was and wasn't great at. I had really high confidence with certain tasks that the AI would achieve a mostly-correct solution. So the next step on my journey was: let agents do all of that work while I worked on other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More specifically, I would start each day by taking the results of my prior night's triage agents, filter them manually to find the issues that an agent will almost certainly solve well, and then keep them going in the background (one at a time, not in parallel).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I'd work on something else. I wasn't going to social media (any more than usual without AI), I wasn't watching videos, etc. I was in my own, normal, pre-AI deep thinking mode working on something I wanted to work on or had to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very important at this stage: turn off agent desktop notifications. Context switching is very expensive. In order to remain efficient, I found that it was my job as a human to be in control of when I interrupt the agent, not the other way around. Don't let the agent notify you. During natural breaks in your work, tab over and check on it, then carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, I think the "work on something else" helps counteract the highly publicized Anthropic skill formation paper. Well, you're trading off: not forming skills for the tasks you're delegating to the agent while continuing to form skills naturally in the tasks you continue to work on manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I was firmly in the "no way I can go back" territory. I felt more efficient, but even if I wasn't, the thing I liked the most was that I could now focus my coding and thinking on tasks I really loved while still adequately completing the tasks I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 5: Engineer the Harness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At risk of stating the obvious: agents are much more efficient when they produce the right result the first time, or at worst produce a result that requires minimal touch-ups. The most sure-fire way to achieve this is to give the agent fast, high quality tools to automatically tell it when it is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know if there is a broad industry-accepted term for this yet, but I've grown to calling this "harness engineering." It is the idea that anytime you find an agent makes a mistake, you take the time to engineer a solution such that the agent never makes that mistake again. I don't need to invent any new terms here; if another one exists, I'll jump on the bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comes in two forms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better implicit prompting (AGENTS.md). For simple things, like the agent repeatedly running the wrong commands or finding the wrong APIs, update the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt;(or equivalent). Here is an example from Ghostty. Each line in that file is based on a bad agent behavior, and it almost completely resolved them all.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Actual, programmed tools. For example, scripts to take screenshots, run filtered tests, etc etc. This is usually paired with an AGENTS.md change to let it know about this existing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where I'm at today. I'm making an earnest effort whenever I see an agent do a Bad Thing to prevent it from ever doing that bad thing again. Or, conversely, I'm making an earnest effort for agents to be able to verify they're doing a Good Thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 6: Always Have an Agent Running&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simultaneous to step 5, I'm also operating under the goal of having an agent running at all times. If an agent isn't running, I ask myself "is there something an agent could be doing for me right now?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I particularly like to combine this with slower, more thoughtful models like Amp's deep mode (which is basically just GPT-5.2-Codex) which can take upwards of 30+ minutes to make small changes. The flip side of that is that it does tend to produce very good results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not [yet?] running multiple agents, and currently don't really want to. I find having the one agent running is a good balance for me right now between being able to do deep, manual work I find enjoyable, and babysitting my kind of stupid and yet mysteriously productive robot friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "have an agent running at all times" goal is still just a goal. I'd say right now I'm maybe effective at having a background agent running 10 to 20% of a normal working day. But, I'm actively working to improve that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't want to run agents for the sake of running agents. I only want to run them when there is a task I think would be truly helpful to me. Part of the challenge of this goal is improving my own workflows and tools so that I can have a constant stream of high quality work to do that I can delegate. Which, even without AI, is important!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's where I'm at today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through this journey, I've personally reached a point where I'm having success with modern AI tooling and I believe I'm approaching it with the proper measured view that is grounded in reality. I really don't care one way or the other if AI is here to stay3, I'm a software craftsman that just wants to build stuff for the love of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole landscape is moving so rapidly that I'm sure I'll look back at this post very quickly and laugh at my naivete. But, as they say, if you can't be embarassed about your past self, you're probably not growing. I just hope I'll grow in the right direction!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no skin in the game here4, and there are of course other reasons behind utility to avoid using AI. I fully respect anyone's individual decisions regarding it. I'm not here to convince you! For those interested, I just wanted to share my personal approach to navigating these new tools and give a glimpse about how I approach new tools in general, regardless of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written by Nicholas Carlini, a researcher on our Safeguards team. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been experimenting with a new approach to supervising language models that we’re calling "agent teams."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With agent teams, multiple Claude instances work in parallel on a shared codebase without active human intervention. This approach dramatically expands the scope of what's achievable with LLM agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To stress test it, I tasked 16 agents with writing a Rust-based C compiler, from scratch, capable of compiling the Linux kernel. Over nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions and $20,000 in API costs, the agent team produced a 100,000-line compiler that can build Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler is an interesting artifact on its own, but I focus here on what I learned about designing harnesses for long-running autonomous agent teams: how to write tests that keep agents on track without human oversight, how to structure work so multiple agents can make progress in parallel, and where this approach hits its ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enabling long-running Claudes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing agent scaffolds like Claude Code require an operator to be online and available to work jointly. If you ask for a solution to a long and complex problem, the model may solve part of it, but eventually it will stop and wait for continued input—a question, a status update, or a request for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To elicit sustained, autonomous progress, I built a harness that sticks Claude in a simple loop (if you’ve seen Ralph-loop, this should look familiar). When it finishes one task, it immediately picks up the next. (Run this in a container, not your actual machine).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short=6 HEAD)
    LOGFILE="agent_logs/agent_${COMMIT}.log"

    claude --dangerously-skip-permissions \
           -p "$(cat AGENT_PROMPT.md)" \
           --model claude-opus-X-Y &amp;amp;&amp;gt; "$LOGFILE"
done
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;In the agent prompt, I tell Claude what problem to solve and ask it to approach the problem by breaking it into small pieces, tracking what it’s working on, figuring out what to work on next, and to effectively keep going until it’s perfect. (On this last point, Claude has no choice. The loop runs forever—although in one instance, I did see Claude &lt;code&gt;pkill -9 bash&lt;/code&gt; on accident, thus killing itself and ending the loop. Whoops!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Running Claude in parallel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running multiple instances in parallel can address two weaknesses of a single-agent harness:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One Claude Code session can only do one thing at a time. Especially as the scope of a project expands, debugging multiple issues in parallel is far more efficient.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running multiple Claude agents allows for specialization. While a few agents are tasked to solve the actual problem at hand, other specialized agents can be invoked to (for example) maintain documentation, keep an eye on code quality, or solve specialized sub-tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My implementation of parallel Claude is bare-bones. A new bare git repo is created, and for each agent, a Docker container is spun up with the repo mounted to &lt;code&gt;/upstream&lt;/code&gt;. Each agent clones a local copy to &lt;code&gt;/workspace&lt;/code&gt;, and when it's done, pushes from its own local container to upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent two agents from trying to solve the same problem at the same time, the harness uses a simple synchronization algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude takes a "lock" on a task by writing a text file to current_tasks/ (e.g., one agent might lock current_tasks/parse_if_statement.txt, while another locks current_tasks/codegen_function_definition.txt). If two agents try to claim the same task, git's synchronization forces the second agent to pick a different one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude works on the task, then pulls from upstream, merges changes from other agents, pushes its changes, and removes the lock. Merge conflicts are frequent, but Claude is smart enough to figure that out.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The infinite agent-generation-loop spawns a new Claude Code session in a fresh container, and the cycle repeats.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very early research prototype. I haven’t yet implemented any other method for communication between agents, nor do I enforce any process for managing high-level goals. I don’t use an orchestration agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I leave it up to each Claude agent to decide how to act. In most cases, Claude picks up the “next most obvious” problem. When stuck on a bug, Claude will often maintain a running doc of failed approaches and remaining tasks. In the git repository of the project, you can read through the history and watch it take out locks on various tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons from programming with Claude agent teams&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scaffolding runs Claude in a loop, but that loop is only useful if Claude can tell how to make progress. Most of my effort went into designing the environment around Claude—the tests, the environment, the feedback—so that it could orient itself without me. These are the approaches I’ve found most helpful when orchestrating multiple Claude instances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Write extremely high-quality tests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it. So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem. Improving the testing harness required finding high-quality compiler test suites, writing verifiers and build scripts for open-source software packages, and watching for mistakes Claude was making, then designing new tests as I identified those failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, near the end of the project, Claude started to frequently break existing functionality each time it implemented a new feature. To address this, I built a continuous integration pipeline and implemented stricter enforcement that allowed Claude to better test its work so that new commits can’t break existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Put yourself in Claude’s shoes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had to constantly remind myself that I was writing this test harness for Claude and not for myself, which meant rethinking many of my assumptions about how tests should communicate results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, each agent is dropped into a fresh container with no context and will spend significant time orienting itself, especially on large projects. Before we even reach the tests, to help Claude help itself, I included instructions to maintain extensive READMEs and progress files that should be updated frequently with the current status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also kept in mind the fact that language models have inherent limitations, which, in this case, needed to be designed around. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Context window pollution: The test harness should not print thousands of useless bytes. At most, it should print a few lines of output and log all important information to a file so Claude can find it when needed. Logfiles should be easy to process automatically: if there are errors, Claude should write ERROR and put the reason on the same line so grep will find it. It helps to pre-compute aggregate summary statistics so Claude doesn't have to recompute them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Time blindness: Claude can't tell time and, left alone, will happily spend hours running tests instead of making progress. The harness prints incremental progress infrequently (to avoid polluting context) and includes a default &lt;code&gt;--fast&lt;/code&gt;option that runs a 1% or 10% random sample. This subsample is deterministic per-agent but random across VMs, so Claude still covers all files but each agent can perfectly identify regressions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Make parallelism easy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When there are many distinct failing tests, parallelization is trivial: each agent picks a different failing test to work on. After the test suite reached a 99% pass rate, each agent worked on getting a different small open-source project (e.g., SQlite, Redis, libjpeg, MQuickJS, Lua) to compile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when agents started to compile the Linux kernel, they got stuck. Unlike a test suite with hundreds of independent tests, compiling the Linux kernel is one giant task. Every agent would hit the same bug, fix that bug, and then overwrite each other's changes. Having 16 agents running didn't help because each was stuck solving the same task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix was to use GCC as an online known-good compiler oracle to compare against. I wrote a new test harness that randomly compiled most of the kernel using GCC, and only the remaining files with Claude's C Compiler. If the kernel worked, then the problem wasn’t in Claude’s subset of the files. If it broke, then it could further refine by re-compiling some of these files with GCC. This let each agent work in parallel, fixing different bugs in different files, until Claude's compiler could eventually compile all files. (After this worked, it was still necessary to apply delta debugging techniques to find pairs of files that failed together but worked independently.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Multiple agent roles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parallelism also enables specialization. LLM-written code frequently re-implements existing functionality, so I tasked one agent with coalescing any duplicate code it found. I put another in charge of improving the performance of the compiler itself, and a third I made responsible for outputting efficient compiled code. I asked another agent to critique the design of the project from the perspective of a Rust developer, and make structural changes to the project to improve the overall code quality, and another to work on documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stress testing the limits of agent teams&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project was designed as a capability benchmark. I am interested in stress-testing the limits of what LLMs can just barely achieve today in order to help us prepare for what models will reliably achieve in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been using the C Compiler project as a benchmark across the entire Claude 4 model series. As I did with prior projects, I started by drafting what I wanted: a from-scratch optimizing compiler with no dependencies, GCC-compatible, able to compile the Linux kernel, and designed to support multiple backends. While I specified some aspects of the design (e.g., that it should have an SSA IR to enable multiple optimization passes) I did not go into any detail on how to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous Opus 4 models were barely capable of producing a functional compiler. Opus 4.5 was the first to cross a threshold that allowed it to produce a functional compiler which could pass large test suites, but it was still incapable of compiling any real large projects. My goal with Opus 4.6 was to again test the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions across two weeks, Opus 4.6 consumed 2 billion input tokens and generated 140 million output tokens, a total cost just under $20,000. Compared to even the most expensive Claude Max plans, this was an extremely expensive project. But that total is a fraction of what it would cost me to produce this myself—let alone an entire team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a clean-room implementation (Claude did not have internet access at any point during its development); it depends only on the Rust standard library. The 100,000-line compiler can build a bootable Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V. It can also compile QEMU, FFmpeg, SQlite, postgres, redis, and has a 99% pass rate on most compiler test suites including the GCC torture test suite. It also passes the developer's ultimate litmus test: it can compile and run Doom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler, however, is not without limitations. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It lacks the 16-bit x86 compiler that is necessary to boot Linux out of real mode. For this, it calls out to GCC (the x86_32 and x86_64 compilers are its own).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It does not have its own assembler and linker; these are the very last bits that Claude started automating and are still somewhat buggy. The demo video was produced with a GCC assembler and linker.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The compiler successfully builds many projects, but not all. It's not yet a drop-in replacement for a real compiler.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The generated code is not very efficient. Even with all optimizations enabled, it outputs less efficient code than GCC with all optimizations disabled.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Rust code quality is reasonable, but is nowhere near the quality of what an expert Rust programmer might produce.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities. I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As one particularly challenging example, Opus was unable to implement a 16-bit x86 code generator needed to boot into 16-bit real mode. While the compiler can output correct 16-bit x86 via the 66/67 opcode prefixes, the resulting compiled output is over 60kb, far exceeding the 32k code limit enforced by Linux. Instead, Claude simply cheats here and calls out to GCC for this phase (This is only the case for x86. For ARM or RISC-V, Claude’s compiler can compile completely by itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source code for the compiler is available. Download it, read through the code, and try it on your favorite C projects. I’ve consistently found the best way to understand what language models can do is to push them to their limits, and then study where they start to break down. Over the coming days, I’ll continue having Claude push new changes if you want to follow along with Claude’s continued attempts at addressing these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking forward&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each generation of language models opens up new ways of working with them. Early models were useful for tab-completion in IDEs. Before long, models could complete a function body from its docstring. The launch of Claude Code brought agents into the mainstream and enabled developers to pair-program with Claude. But each of these products operates under the assumption that a user defines a task, an LLM runs for a few seconds or minutes and returns an answer, and then the user provides a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent teams show the possibility of implementing entire, complex projects autonomously. This allows us, as users of these tools, to become more ambitious with our goals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are still early, and fully autonomous development comes with real risks. When a human sits with Claude during development, they can ensure consistent quality and catch errors in real time. For autonomous systems, it is easy to see tests pass and assume the job is done, when this is rarely the case. I used to work in penetration testing, exploiting vulnerabilities in products produced by large companies, and the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, while this experiment excites me, it also leaves me feeling uneasy. Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026. The rapid progress in both language models and the scaffolds we use to interact with them opens the door to writing an enormous amount of new code. I expect the positive applications to outweigh the negative, but we’re entering a new world which will require new strategies to navigate safely.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Eligibility requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be eligible for this promotion, you must meet the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You started your Pro or Max subscription before Wednesday, February 4, 2026 at 11:59 PM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You have enabled extra usage before Monday, February 16, 2026 at 11:59 PM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This offer does not apply to Team, Enterprise, or API/Console users. There are no exceptions to these eligibility requirements. This offer has no cash value and is not assignable or transferable. It may not be combined with other offers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to claim the $50 credit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How you receive the credit depends on whether you already have extra usage enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If extra usage is already enabled: The $50 credit will be applied to your account automatically. No action is needed on your part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If extra usage is not enabled: You'll need to enable extra usage to claim the credit. Here's how:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Usage.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enable extra usage when prompted.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Your $50 credit will be applied once extra usage is active.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This promotion can be claimed from Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 10 AM PT through Monday, February 16, 2026 at 11:59 PM PT. After this window closes, the credit can no longer be claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where can I use this credit?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The $50 credit can be used for Claude, Claude Code, and Cowork, including all models and features available on your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Settings &amp;gt; Usage is not accessible via the Claude mobile apps, so if you haven’t enabled extra usage yet, you’ll need to do this on the web version of Claude before you receive the credit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When does my credit expire?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your $50 credit expires 60 days after the date you claim it. Any unused portion of the credit will not carry over after that date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the credit expires or is fully used, extra usage will remain enabled on your account. If you’ve also enabled auto-reload in Settings &amp;gt; Usage under Extra usage, then any usage beyond your plan limits after that point will be billed at the standard extra usage rate. If you don't want to use extra usage going forward, you can disable it in your account settings at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Your home has a living room, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and garage. Each room serves a different purpose. But they're all under the same roof, connected by hallways and doors. You don't build a separate restaurant building just because you need to cook. You don't construct a commercial garage across town just to park your car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what Postgres is. One home with many rooms. Search, vectors, time-series, queues—all under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is exactly what specialized database vendors don't want you to hear. Their marketing teams have spent years convincing you to "use the right tool for the right job." It sounds reasonable. It sounds wise. And it sells a lot of databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me show you why it's a trap and why Postgres is the better choice in 99% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard the advice: “Use the right tool for the right job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds wise. So you end up with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations. You now have seven databases to manage. Seven query languages to learn. Seven backup strategies to maintain. Seven security models to audit. Six sets of credentials to rotate. Seven monitoring dashboards to watch. And seven things that can break at 3 AM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when something does break? Good luck spinning up a test environment to debug it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a different idea: Just use Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about simplicity. AI agents have made database sprawl a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about what agents need to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one database? That’s a single command. Fork it, test it, done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With seven databases? Now you need to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is virtually impossible without a ton of R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just agents. Every time something breaks at 3 AM, you need to spin up a test environment to debug. With six databases, that’s a coordination nightmare. With one database, it’s a single command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the AI era, simplicity isn’t just elegant. It’s essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s address this head-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The myth: Specialized databases are far superior at their specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality: Sometimes they’re marginally better at a narrow task. But they also bring unnecessary complexity. It’s like hiring a private chef for every meal. Sounds luxurious, but it adds expense, coordination overhead, and creates problems you didn’t have before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: 99% of companies don't need them. The top 1% have tens of millions of users and a large engineering team to match. You've read their blog posts about how amazing Specialized Database X works for them. But that's their scale, their team, their problems. For everyone else, Postgres is more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what most people don’t realize: Postgres extensions use the same or better algorithms as specialized databases (in many cases).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “specialized database” premium? Mostly marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What You Need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialized Tool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postgres Extension&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same Algorithm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-text search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;pg_textsearch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅ Both use BM25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vector search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinecone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;pgvector + pgvectorscale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅ Both use HNSW/DiskANN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;TimescaleDB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅ Both use time partitioning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caching&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNLOGGED tables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅ Both use in-memory storage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;MongoDB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;JSONB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅ Both use document indexing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geospatial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialized GIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;PostGIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅ Industry standard since 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren’t watered-down versions. They’re the same/better algorithms, battle-tested, open source, and often developed by the same researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmarks back this up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the AI/agent problem, database sprawl has compounding costs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Database&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven Databases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backup strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring dashboards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security patches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-call runbooks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failover testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive load: Your team needs SQL, Redis commands, Elasticsearch Query DSL, MongoDB aggregation, Kafka patterns, and InfluxDB’s non-native SQL workaround. That’s not specialization. That’s fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data consistency: Keeping Elasticsearch in sync with Postgres? You build sync jobs. They fail. Data drifts. You add reconciliation. That fails too. Now you’re maintaining infrastructure instead of building features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLA math: Three systems at 99.9% uptime each = 99.7% combined. That’s 26 hours of downtime per year instead of 8.7. Every system multiplies your failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These extensions aren’t new. They’ve been production-ready for years:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 48,000 companies use PostgreSQL, including Netflix, Spotify, Uber, Reddit, Instagram, and Discord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI era brought a new generation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extension&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replaces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinecone, Qdrant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiskANN algorithm. 28x lower latency, 75% less cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;True BM25 ranking natively in Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;External AI pipelines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auto-sync embeddings as data changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this means: Building a RAG app used to require Postgres + Pinecone + Elasticsearch + glue code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now? Just Postgres. One database. One query language. One backup. One fork command for your AI agent to spin up a test environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s all you need:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- Full-text search with BM25

You don't construct a commercial garage across town just to park your car. You use the rooms in your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what we've shown you here. Search, vectors, time-series, documents, queues, caching—they're all rooms in the Postgres home. Same algorithms as the specialized databases. Battle-tested for years. Used by Netflix, Uber, Discord, and 48,000 other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what about that 99%?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 99% of companies, Postgres handles everything you need. The 1%? That's when you're processing petabytes of logs across hundreds of nodes, or you need Kibana's specific dashboards, or you have exotic requirements that genuinely exceed what Postgres can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the thing: you'll know when you're in the 1%. You won't need a vendor's marketing team to tell you. You'll have benchmarked it yourself and hit a real wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, don't scatter your data across seven buildings because someone told you to "use the right tool for the right job." That advice sells databases. It doesn't serve you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with Postgres. Stay with Postgres. Add complexity only when you've earned the need for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2026, just use Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these extensions are available on Tiger Data.

    &lt;p&gt;REVIEW OF 1984&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; By Isaac Asimov&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been writing a four-part article for Field Newspaper Syndicate at the&lt;lb/&gt; beginning of each year for several years now and in 1980, mindful of the&lt;lb/&gt; approach of the year 1984, FNS asked me to write a thorough critique of&lt;lb/&gt; George Orwell's novel 1984.&lt;lb/&gt; I was reluctant. I remembered almost nothing of the book and said so -&lt;lb/&gt; but Denison Demac, the lovely young woman who is my contact at FNS, simply&lt;lb/&gt; sent me a copy of it and said, 'Read it.'&lt;lb/&gt; So I read it and found myself absolutely astonished at what I read. I&lt;lb/&gt; wondered how many people who talked about the novel so glibly had ever read&lt;lb/&gt; it; or if they had, whether they remembered it at all.&lt;lb/&gt; I felt I would have to write the critique if only to set people straight.&lt;lb/&gt; (I'm sorry; I love setting people straight.)&lt;lb/&gt; A. THE WRITING OF 1984&lt;lb/&gt; In 1949, a book entitled 1984 was published. It was written by Eric Arthur&lt;lb/&gt; Blair under the pseudonym of George Orwell.&lt;lb/&gt; The book attempted to show what life would be like in a world of total&lt;lb/&gt; evil, in which those controlling the government kept themselves in power by&lt;lb/&gt; brute force, by distorting the truth, by continually rewriting history, by&lt;lb/&gt; mesmerising the people generally.&lt;lb/&gt; This evil world was placed only thirty-five years in the future so that&lt;lb/&gt; even men who were already in their early middle age at the time the book was&lt;lb/&gt; published might live to see it if they lived out a normal lifetime.&lt;lb/&gt; I, for instance, was already a married man when the book appeared and yet&lt;lb/&gt; here we are less than four years away from that apocalyptic year (for '1984'&lt;lb/&gt; has become a year that is associated with dread because of Orwell's book),&lt;lb/&gt; and I am very likely to live to see it.&lt;lb/&gt; In this chapter, I will discuss the book, but first: Who was Blair/Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; and why was the book written?&lt;lb/&gt; Blair was born in 1903 into the status of a British gentleman. His father&lt;lb/&gt; was in the Indian civil service and Blair himself lived the life of a&lt;lb/&gt; British Imperial official. He went to Eton, served in Burma, and so on.&lt;lb/&gt; However, he lacked the money to be an English gentleman to the full.&lt;lb/&gt; Then, too, he didn't want to spend his time at dull desk jobs; he wanted to&lt;lb/&gt; be a writer. Thirdly, he felt guilty about his status in the upper class.&lt;lb/&gt; So he did in the late 1920s what so many well-to-do American young people&lt;lb/&gt; in the 1960s did. In short, he became what we would have called a 'hippie'&lt;lb/&gt; at a later time. He lived under slum conditions in London and Paris,&lt;lb/&gt; consorted with and identified with slum dwellers and vagrants, managed to&lt;lb/&gt; ease his conscience and, at the same time, to gather material for his&lt;lb/&gt; earliest books.&lt;lb/&gt; He also turned left wing and became a socialist, fighting with the&lt;lb/&gt; loyalists in Spain in the 1930s. There he found himself caught up in the&lt;lb/&gt; sectarian struggles between the various left-wing factions, and since he&lt;lb/&gt; believed in a gentlemanly English form of socialism, he was inevitably on&lt;lb/&gt; the losing side. Opposed to him were passionate Spanish anarchists,&lt;lb/&gt; syndicalists, and communists, who bitterly resented the fact that the&lt;lb/&gt; necessities of fighting the Franco fascists got in the way of their fighting&lt;lb/&gt; each other.&lt;lb/&gt; The communists, who were the best organised, won out and Orwell had to leave&lt;lb/&gt; Spain, for he was convinced that if he did not, he would be killed&lt;lb/&gt; From then on, to the end of his life, he carried on a private literary&lt;lb/&gt; war with the communists, determined to win in words the battle he had lost&lt;lb/&gt; in action.&lt;lb/&gt; During World War II, in which he was rejected for military service, he&lt;lb/&gt; was associated with the left wing of the British Labour party, but didn't&lt;lb/&gt; much sympathise with their views, for even their reckless version of&lt;lb/&gt; socialism seemed too well organised for him.&lt;lb/&gt; He wasn't much affected, apparently, by the Nazi brand of&lt;lb/&gt; totalitarianism, for there was no room within him except for his private war&lt;lb/&gt; with Stalinist communism. Consequently, when Great Britain was fighting for&lt;lb/&gt; its life against Nazism, and the Soviet Union fought as an ally in the&lt;lb/&gt; struggle and contributed rather more than its share in lives lost and in&lt;lb/&gt; resolute courage, Orwell wrote Animal Farm which was a satire of the Russian&lt;lb/&gt; Revolution and what followed, picturing it in terms of a revolt of barnyard&lt;lb/&gt; animals against human masters.&lt;lb/&gt; He completed Animal Farm in 1944 and had trouble finding a publisher&lt;lb/&gt; since it wasn't a particularly good time for upsetting the Soviets. As soon&lt;lb/&gt; as the war came to an end, however, the Soviet Union was fair game and&lt;lb/&gt; Animal Farm was published. It was greeted with much acclaim and Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; became sufficiently prosperous to retire and devote himself to his&lt;lb/&gt; masterpiece, 1984.&lt;lb/&gt; That book described society as a vast world-wide extension of Stalinist&lt;lb/&gt; Russia in the 1930s, pictured with the venom of a rival left-wing sectarian.&lt;lb/&gt; Other forms of totalitarianism play a small role. There are one or two&lt;lb/&gt; mentions of the Nazis and of the Inquisition. At the very start, there is a&lt;lb/&gt; reference or two to Jews, almost as though they were going to prove the&lt;lb/&gt; objects of persecution, but that vanishes almost at once, as though Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; didn't want readers to mistake the villains for Nazis.&lt;lb/&gt; The picture is of Stalinism, and Stalinism only.&lt;lb/&gt; By the time the book came out in 1949, the Cold War was at its height.&lt;lb/&gt; The book therefore proved popular. It was almost a matter of patriotism in&lt;lb/&gt; the West to buy it and talk about it, and perhaps even to read parts of it,&lt;lb/&gt; although it is my opinion that more people bought it and talked about it&lt;lb/&gt; than read it, for it is a dreadfully dull book - didactic, repetitious, and&lt;lb/&gt; all but motionless.&lt;lb/&gt; It was most popular at first with people who leaned towards the&lt;lb/&gt; conservative side of the political spectrum, for it was clearly an&lt;lb/&gt; anti-Soviet polemic, and the picture of life it projected in the London of&lt;lb/&gt; 1984 was very much as conservatives imagined life in the Moscow of 1949 to&lt;lb/&gt; be.&lt;lb/&gt; During the McCarthy era in the United States, 1984 became increasingly&lt;lb/&gt; popular with those who leaned towards the liberal side of the political&lt;lb/&gt; spectrum, for it seemed to them that the United States of the early 1950s&lt;lb/&gt; was beginning to move in the direction of thought-control and that all the&lt;lb/&gt; viciousness Orwell had depicted was on its way towards us.&lt;lb/&gt; Thus, in an afterword to an edition published in paperback by New&lt;lb/&gt; American Library in 1961, the liberal psychoanalyst and philosopher Erich&lt;lb/&gt; Fromm concluded as follows:&lt;lb/&gt; 'Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings, and it would be most&lt;lb/&gt; unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of&lt;lb/&gt; Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too.'&lt;lb/&gt; Even if Stalinism and McCarthyism are disregarded, however, more and more&lt;lb/&gt; Americans were becoming aware of just how 'big' the government was getting;&lt;lb/&gt; how high taxes were; how increasingly rules and regulations permeated&lt;lb/&gt; business and even ordinary life; how information concerning every facet of&lt;lb/&gt; private life was entering the files not only of government bureaux but of&lt;lb/&gt; private credit systems.&lt;lb/&gt; 1984, therefore, came to stand not for Stalinism, or even for&lt;lb/&gt; dictatorship in general - but merely for government. Even governmental&lt;lb/&gt; paternalism seemed '1984ish' and the catch phrase 'Big Brother is watching&lt;lb/&gt; you' came to mean everything that was too big for the individual to control.&lt;lb/&gt; It was not only big government and big business that was a symptom of 1984&lt;lb/&gt; but big science, big labour, big anything.&lt;lb/&gt; In fact, so thoroughly has 1984-ophobia penetrated the consciousness of&lt;lb/&gt; many who have not read the book and have no notion of what it contains, that&lt;lb/&gt; one wonders what will happen to us after 31 December 1984. When New Year's&lt;lb/&gt; Day of 1985 arrives and the United States is still in existence and facing&lt;lb/&gt; very much the problems it faces today, how will we express our fears of&lt;lb/&gt; whatever aspect of life fills us with apprehension? What new date can we&lt;lb/&gt; invent to take the place of 1984?&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell did not live to see his book become the success it did. He did not&lt;lb/&gt; witness the way in which he made 1984 into a year that would haunt a whole&lt;lb/&gt; generation of Americans. Orwell died of tuberculosis in a London hospital in&lt;lb/&gt; January 1950, just a few months after the book was published, at the age of&lt;lb/&gt; forty-six. His awareness of imminent death may have added to the bitterness&lt;lb/&gt; of the book.&lt;lb/&gt; B. THE SCIENCE FICTION OF 1984&lt;lb/&gt; Many people think of 1984 as a science fiction novel, but almost the only&lt;lb/&gt; item about 1984 that would lead one to suppose this is the fact that it is&lt;lb/&gt; purportedly laid in the future. Not so! Orwell had no feel for the future,&lt;lb/&gt; and the displacement of the story is much more geographical than temporal.&lt;lb/&gt; The London in which the story is placed is not so much moved thirty-five&lt;lb/&gt; years forward in time, from 1949 to 1984, as it is moved a thousand miles&lt;lb/&gt; east in space to Moscow.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell imagines Great Britain to have gone through a revolution similar&lt;lb/&gt; to the Russian Revolution and to have gone through all the stages that&lt;lb/&gt; Soviet development did. He can think of almost no variations on the theme.&lt;lb/&gt; The Soviets had a series of purges in the 1930s, so the Ingsoc (English&lt;lb/&gt; Socialism) had a series of purges in the 1950s.&lt;lb/&gt; The Soviets converted one of their revolutionaries, Leon Trotsky, into a&lt;lb/&gt; villain, leaving his opponent, Joseph Stalin, as a hero. The Ingsoc,&lt;lb/&gt; therefore, convert one of their revolutionaries, Emmanuel Goldstein, into a&lt;lb/&gt; villain, leaving his opponent, with a moustache like Stalin, as a hero.&lt;lb/&gt; There is no ability to make minor changes, even. Goldstein, like Trotsky,&lt;lb/&gt; has 'a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a&lt;lb/&gt; small goatee beard'. Orwell apparently does not want to confuse the issue by&lt;lb/&gt; giving Stalin a different name so he calls him merely 'Big Brother'.&lt;lb/&gt; At the very beginning of the story, it is made clear that television&lt;lb/&gt; (which was coming into existence at the time the book was written) served as&lt;lb/&gt; a continuous means of indoctrination of the people, for sets cannot be&lt;lb/&gt; turned off. (And, apparently, in a deteriorating London in which nothing&lt;lb/&gt; works, these sets never fail.)&lt;lb/&gt; The great Orwellian contribution to future technology is that the&lt;lb/&gt; television set is two-way, and that the people who are forced to hear and&lt;lb/&gt; see the television screen can themselves be heard and seen at all times and&lt;lb/&gt; are under constant supervision even while sleeping or in the bathroom.&lt;lb/&gt; Hence, the meaning of the phrase 'Big Brother is watching you'.&lt;lb/&gt; This is an extraordinarily inefficient system of keeping everyone under&lt;lb/&gt; control. To have a person being watched at all times means that some other&lt;lb/&gt; person must be doing the watching at all times (at least in the Orwellian&lt;lb/&gt; society) and must be doing so very narrowly, for there is a great&lt;lb/&gt; development of the art of interpreting gesture and facial expression.&lt;lb/&gt; One person cannot watch more than one person in full concentration, and&lt;lb/&gt; can only do so for a comparatively short time before attention begins to&lt;lb/&gt; wander. I should guess, in short, that there may have to be five watchers&lt;lb/&gt; for every person watched. And then, of course, the watchers must themselves&lt;lb/&gt; be watched since no one in the Orwellian world is suspicion-free.&lt;lb/&gt; Consequently, the system of oppression by two-way television simply will not&lt;lb/&gt; work.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell himself realised this by limiting its workings to the Party&lt;lb/&gt; members. The 'proles' (proletariat), for whom Orwell cannot hide his British&lt;lb/&gt; upper-class contempt, are left largely to themselves as subhuman. (At one&lt;lb/&gt; point in the book, he says that any prole that shows ability is killed - a&lt;lb/&gt; leaf taken out of the Spartan treatment of their helots&lt;lb/&gt; twenty-five hundred years ago.)&lt;lb/&gt; Furthermore, he has a system of volunteer spies in which children report&lt;lb/&gt; on their parents, and neighbours on each other. This cannot possibly work&lt;lb/&gt; well since eventually everyone reports everyone else and it all has to be&lt;lb/&gt; abandoned.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell was unable to conceive of computers or robots, or he would have&lt;lb/&gt; placed everyone under non-human surveillance. Our own computers to some&lt;lb/&gt; extent do this in the IRS, in credit files, and so on, but that does not&lt;lb/&gt; take us towards 1984, except in fevered imaginations. Computers and tyranny&lt;lb/&gt; do not necessarily go hand in hand. Tyrannies have worked very well without&lt;lb/&gt; computers (consider the Nazis) and the most computerised nations in today's&lt;lb/&gt; world are also the least tyrannical.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell lacks the capacity to see (or invent) small changes. His hero&lt;lb/&gt; finds it difficult in his world of 1984 to get shoelaces or razor blades. So&lt;lb/&gt; would I in the real world of the 1980s, for so many people use slip-on shoes&lt;lb/&gt; and electric razors.&lt;lb/&gt; Then, too, Orwell had the technophobic fixation that every technological&lt;lb/&gt; advance is a slide downhill. Thus, when his hero writes, he 'fitted a nib&lt;lb/&gt; into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. He does so 'because&lt;lb/&gt; of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with&lt;lb/&gt; a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil'.&lt;lb/&gt; Presumably, the 'ink-pencil' is the ball-point pen that was coming into&lt;lb/&gt; use at the time that 1984 was being written. This means that Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; describes something as being written' with a real nib but being 'scratched'&lt;lb/&gt; with a ball-point. This is, however, precisely the reverse of the truth. If&lt;lb/&gt; you are old enough to remember steel pens, you will remember that they&lt;lb/&gt; scratched fearsomely, and you know ball-points don't.&lt;lb/&gt; This is not science fiction, but a distorted nostalgia for a past that&lt;lb/&gt; never was. I am surprised that Orwell stopped with the steel pen and that he&lt;lb/&gt; didn't have Winston writing with a neat goose quill.&lt;lb/&gt; Nor was Orwell particularly prescient in the strictly social aspects of&lt;lb/&gt; the future he was presenting, with the result that the Orwellian world of&lt;lb/&gt; 1984 is incredibly old-fashioned when compared with the real world of the&lt;lb/&gt; 1980s.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell imagines no new vices, for instance. His characters are all gin&lt;lb/&gt; hounds and tobacco addicts, and part of the horror of his picture of 1984 is&lt;lb/&gt; his eloquent description of the low quality of the gin and tobacco.&lt;lb/&gt; He foresees no new drugs, no marijuana, no synthetic hallucinogens. No&lt;lb/&gt; one expects an s.f. writer to be precise and exact in his forecasts, but&lt;lb/&gt; surely one would expect him to invent some differences.&lt;lb/&gt; In his despair (or anger), Orwell forgets the virtues human beings have.&lt;lb/&gt; All his characters are, in one way or another, weak or sadistic, or sleazy,&lt;lb/&gt; or stupid, or repellent. This may be how most people are, or how Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; wants to indicate they will all be under tyranny, but it seems to me that&lt;lb/&gt; under even the worst tyrannies, so far, there have been brave men and women&lt;lb/&gt; who have withstood the tyrants to the death and whose personal histories are&lt;lb/&gt; luminous flames in the surrounding darkness. If only because there is no&lt;lb/&gt; hint of this in 1984, it does not resemble the real world of the 1980s.&lt;lb/&gt; Nor did he foresee any difference in the role of women or any weakening&lt;lb/&gt; of the feminine stereotype of 1949. There are only two female characters of&lt;lb/&gt; importance. One is a strong, brainless 'prole' woman who is an endless&lt;lb/&gt; washerwoman, endlessly singing a popular song with words of the type&lt;lb/&gt; familiar in the 1930s and 1940s (at which Orwell shudders fastidiously as&lt;lb/&gt; 'trashy', in blissful non-anticipation of hard rock).&lt;lb/&gt; The other is the heroine, Julia, who is sexually promiscuous (but is at&lt;lb/&gt; least driven to courage by her interest in sex) and is otherwise brainless.&lt;lb/&gt; When the hero, Winston, reads to her the book within a book that explains&lt;lb/&gt; the nature of the Orwellian world, she responds by falling asleep - but then&lt;lb/&gt; since the treatise Winston reads is stupefyingly soporific, this may be an&lt;lb/&gt; indication of Julia's good sense rather than the reverse.&lt;lb/&gt; In short, if 1984 must be considered science fiction, then it is very bad&lt;lb/&gt; science fiction.&lt;lb/&gt; C. THE GOVERNMENT OF 1984&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell's 1984 is a picture of all-powerful government, and it has helped&lt;lb/&gt; make the notion of 'big government' a very frightening one.&lt;lb/&gt; We have to remember, though, that the world of the late 1940s, during&lt;lb/&gt; which Orwell was writing his book, was one in which there had been, and&lt;lb/&gt; still were, big governments with true tyrants - individuals whose every&lt;lb/&gt; wish, however unjust, cruel or vicious, was law. What's more, it seemed as&lt;lb/&gt; though such tyrants were irremovable except by the chance of outside force.&lt;lb/&gt; Benito Mussolini of Italy, after twenty-one years of absolute rule, was&lt;lb/&gt; overthrown, but that was only because his country was suffering defeat in&lt;lb/&gt; war.&lt;lb/&gt; Adolf Hitler of Germany, a far stronger and more brutal tyrant, ruled&lt;lb/&gt; with a steel hand for twelve years, yet even defeat did not, in itself,&lt;lb/&gt; bring about his overthrow. Though the area over which he ruled shrank and&lt;lb/&gt; shrank and shrank, and even though overwhelming armies of his adversaries&lt;lb/&gt; closed in from the east and west, he remained absolute tyrant over whatever&lt;lb/&gt; area he controlled - even when it was only over the bunker in which he&lt;lb/&gt; committed suicide. Until he removed himself, no one dared remove him. (There&lt;lb/&gt; were plots against him, to be sure, but they never worked, sometimes through&lt;lb/&gt; quirks of fate that seemed explainable only by supposing that someone down&lt;lb/&gt; there liked him.)&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell, however, had no time for either Mussolini or Hitler. His enemy&lt;lb/&gt; was Stalin, and at the time that 1984 was published, Stalin had ruled the&lt;lb/&gt; Soviet Union in a ribbreaking bear hug for twenty-five years, had survived a&lt;lb/&gt; terrible war in which his nation suffered enormous losses and yet was now&lt;lb/&gt; stronger than ever. To Orwell, it must have seemed that neither time nor&lt;lb/&gt; fortune could budge Stalin, but that he would live on forever with ever&lt;lb/&gt; increasing strength. - And that was how Orwell pictured Big Brother.&lt;lb/&gt; Of course, that was not the way it really was. Orwell didn't live long&lt;lb/&gt; enough to see it but Stalin died only three years after 1984 was published,&lt;lb/&gt; and it was not long after that that his regime was denounced as a tyranny&lt;lb/&gt; by - guess who - the Soviet leadership.&lt;lb/&gt; The Soviet Union is still the Soviet Union, but it is not Stalinist, and&lt;lb/&gt; the enemies of the state are no longer liquidated (Orwell uses 'vaporised'&lt;lb/&gt; instead, such small changes being all he can manage) with quite such&lt;lb/&gt; abandon.&lt;lb/&gt; Again, Mao Tse-tung died in China, and while he himself has not been&lt;lb/&gt; openly denounced, his close associates, as 'the Gang of Four', were promptly&lt;lb/&gt; demoted from Divinity, and while China is still China, it is not Maoist any&lt;lb/&gt; longer.&lt;lb/&gt; Franco of Spain died in his bed and while, to his very last breath, he&lt;lb/&gt; remained the unquestioned leader he had been for nearly forty years,&lt;lb/&gt; immediately after that last breath, Fascism abruptly dwindled in Spain, as&lt;lb/&gt; it had in Portugal after Salazar's death.&lt;lb/&gt; In short, Big Brothers do die, or at least they have so far, and when&lt;lb/&gt; they die, the government changes, always for the milder.&lt;lb/&gt; This is not to say that new tyrants may not make themselves felt, but&lt;lb/&gt; they will die, too. At least in the real 1980s we have every confidence they&lt;lb/&gt; will and the undying Big Brother is not yet a real threat.&lt;lb/&gt; If anything, in fact, governments of the 1980s seem dangerously weak. The&lt;lb/&gt; advance of technology has put powerful weapons - explosives, machine guns,&lt;lb/&gt; fast cars into the hands of urban terrorists who can and do kidnap, hijack,&lt;lb/&gt; gun down, and take hostages with impunity while governments stand by more or&lt;lb/&gt; less helplessly.&lt;lb/&gt; In addition to the immortality of Big Brother, Orwell presents two other&lt;lb/&gt; ways of maintaining an eternal tyranny.&lt;lb/&gt; First -,present someone or something to hate. In the Orwellian world it&lt;lb/&gt; was Emmanuel Goldstein for whom hate was built up and orchestrated in a&lt;lb/&gt; robotized mass function.&lt;lb/&gt; This is nothing new, of course. Every nation in the world has used&lt;lb/&gt; various neighbours for the purpose of hate. This sort of thing is so easily&lt;lb/&gt; handled and comes as such second nature to humanity that one wonders why&lt;lb/&gt; there have to be the organised hate drives in the Orwellian world.&lt;lb/&gt; It needs scarcely any clever psychological mass movements to make Arabs&lt;lb/&gt; hate Israelis and Greeks hate Turks and Catholic Irish hate Protestant&lt;lb/&gt; Irish - and vice versa in each case. To be sure, the Nazis organised mass&lt;lb/&gt; meetings of delirium that every participant seemed to enjoy, but it had no&lt;lb/&gt; permanent effect. Once the war moved on to German soil, the Germans&lt;lb/&gt; surrendered as meekly as though they had never Sieg-Heiled in their lives.&lt;lb/&gt; Second - rewrite history. Almost every one of the few individuals we meet&lt;lb/&gt; in 1984 has, as his job, the rapid rewriting of the past, the readjustment&lt;lb/&gt; of statistics, the overhauling of newspapers - as though anyone is going to&lt;lb/&gt; take the trouble to pay attention to the past anyway.&lt;lb/&gt; This Orwellian preoccupation with the minutiae of 'historical proof' is&lt;lb/&gt; typical of the political sectarian who is always quoting what has been said&lt;lb/&gt; and done in the past to prove a point to someone on the other side who is&lt;lb/&gt; always quoting something to the opposite effect that has been said and done.&lt;lb/&gt; As any politician knows, no evidence of any kind is ever required. It is&lt;lb/&gt; only necessary to make a statement - any statement - forcefully enough to&lt;lb/&gt; have an audience believe it. No one will check the lie against the facts,&lt;lb/&gt; and, if they do, they will disbelieve the facts. Do you think the German&lt;lb/&gt; people in 1939 pretended that the Poles had attacked them and started World&lt;lb/&gt; War II? No! Since they were told that was so, they believed it as seriously&lt;lb/&gt; as you and I believe that they attacked the Poles.&lt;lb/&gt; To be sure, the Soviets put out new editions of their Encyclopaedia in&lt;lb/&gt; which politicians rating a long biography in earlier editions are suddenly&lt;lb/&gt; omitted entirely, and this is no doubt the germ of the Orwellian notion, but&lt;lb/&gt; the chances of carrying it as far as is described in 1984 seem to me to be&lt;lb/&gt; nil - not because it is beyond human wickedness, but because it is totally&lt;lb/&gt; unnecessary.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell makes much of 'Newspeak' as an organ of repression - the&lt;lb/&gt; conversion of the English language into so limited and abbreviated an&lt;lb/&gt; instrument that the very vocabulary of dissent vanishes. Partly he got the&lt;lb/&gt; notion from the undoubted habit of abbreviation. He gives examples of&lt;lb/&gt; 'Communist International' becoming 'Comintern' and 'Geheime Staatspolizei'&lt;lb/&gt; becoming 'Gestapo', but that is not a modern totalitarian invention. 'Vulgus&lt;lb/&gt; mobile' became 'mob'; 'taxi cabriolet' became 'cab'; 'quasi-stellar radio&lt;lb/&gt; source' became 'quasar'; 'light amplification by stimulated emission of&lt;lb/&gt; radiation' became 'laser' and so on. There is no sign that such compressions&lt;lb/&gt; of the language have ever weakened it as a mode of expression.&lt;lb/&gt; As a matter of fact, political obfuscation has tended to use many words&lt;lb/&gt; rather than few, long words rather than short, to extend rather than to&lt;lb/&gt; reduce. Every leader of inadequate education or limited intelligence hides&lt;lb/&gt; behind exuberant inebriation of loquacity.&lt;lb/&gt; Thus, when Winston Churchill suggested the development of 'Basic English'&lt;lb/&gt; as an international language (something which undoubtedly also contributed&lt;lb/&gt; to 'Newspeak'), the suggestion was stillborn.&lt;lb/&gt; We are therefore in no way approaching Newspeak in its condensed form,&lt;lb/&gt; though we have always had Newspeak in its extended form and always will&lt;lb/&gt; have.&lt;lb/&gt; We also have a group of young people among us who say things like 'Right&lt;lb/&gt; on, man, you know. It's like he's got it all together, you know, man. I&lt;lb/&gt; mean, like you know -' and so on for five minutes when the word that the&lt;lb/&gt; young people are groping for is 'Huh?'&lt;lb/&gt; That, however, is not Newspeak, and it has always been with us, too. It&lt;lb/&gt; is something which in Oldspeak is called 'inarticulacy' and it is not what&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell had in mind.&lt;lb/&gt; D. THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION OF 1984&lt;lb/&gt; Although Orwell seemed, by and large, to be helplessly stuck in the world of&lt;lb/&gt; 1949, in one respect at least he showed himself to be remarkably prescient,&lt;lb/&gt; and that was in foreseeing the tripartite split of the world of the 1980s.&lt;lb/&gt; The international world of 1984 is a world of three superpowers: Oceania,&lt;lb/&gt; Eurasia, and Eastasia - and that fits in, very roughly, with the three&lt;lb/&gt; actual superpowers of the 1980s: the United States, the Soviet Union, and&lt;lb/&gt; China.&lt;lb/&gt; Oceania is a combination of the United States and the British Empire.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell, who was an old Imperial civil servant, did not seem to notice that&lt;lb/&gt; the British Empire was in its last throes in the late 1940s and was about to&lt;lb/&gt; dissolve. He seems to suppose, in fact, that the British Empire is the&lt;lb/&gt; dominant member of the British-American combination.&lt;lb/&gt; At least, the entire action takes place in London and phrases such as&lt;lb/&gt; 'the United States' and 'Americans' are rarely, if ever, mentioned. But&lt;lb/&gt; then, this is very much in the fashion of the British spy novel in which,&lt;lb/&gt; ever since World War II, Great Britain (currently about the eighteenth&lt;lb/&gt; strongest military and economic power in the world) is set up as the great&lt;lb/&gt; adversary of the Soviet Union, or of China, or of some invented&lt;lb/&gt; international conspiracy, with the United States either never mentioned or&lt;lb/&gt; reduced to the small courtesy appearance of an occasional CIA agent.&lt;lb/&gt; Eurasia is, of course, the Soviet Union, which Orwell assumes will have&lt;lb/&gt; absorbed the whole European continent. Eurasia, therefore, includes all of&lt;lb/&gt; Europe, plus Siberia, and its population is 95 per cent European by any&lt;lb/&gt; standard. Nevertheless, Orwell describes the Eurasians as 'solid-looking men&lt;lb/&gt; with expressionless Asiatic faces'. Since Orwell still lives in a time when&lt;lb/&gt; 'European' and 'Asiatic' are equivalent to ' 'hero' and 'villain', it is&lt;lb/&gt; impossible to inveigh against the Soviet Union with the proper emotion if it&lt;lb/&gt; is not thought of as 'Asiatic'. This comes under the heading of what&lt;lb/&gt; Orwellian Newspeak calls 'double-think', something that Orwell, like any&lt;lb/&gt; human being, is good at.&lt;lb/&gt; It may be, of course, that Orwell is thinking not of Eurasia, or the&lt;lb/&gt; Soviet Union, but of his great bête noire, Stalin. Stalin is a Georgian, and&lt;lb/&gt; Georgia, lying south of the Caucasus mountains, is, by strict geographic&lt;lb/&gt; considerations, part of Asia.&lt;lb/&gt; Eastasia is, of course, China and various dependent nations.&lt;lb/&gt; Here is prescience. At the time Orwell was writing 1984, the Chinese&lt;lb/&gt; communists had not yet won control of the country and many (in the United&lt;lb/&gt; States, in particular) were doing their best to see that the anti-Communist,&lt;lb/&gt; Chiang Kai-shek, retained control. Once the communists won, it became part&lt;lb/&gt; of the accepted credo of the West that the Chinese would be under thorough&lt;lb/&gt; Soviet control and that China and the Soviet Union would form a monolithic&lt;lb/&gt; communist power.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell not only foresaw the communist victory (he saw that victory&lt;lb/&gt; everywhere, in fact) but also foresaw that Russia and China would not form a&lt;lb/&gt; monolithic bloc but would be deadly enemies.&lt;lb/&gt; There, his own experience as a Leftist sectarian may have helped him. He&lt;lb/&gt; had no Rightist superstitions concerning Leftists as unified and&lt;lb/&gt; indistinguishable villains. He knew they would fight each other as fiercely&lt;lb/&gt; over the most trifling points of doctrine as would the most pious&lt;lb/&gt; of Christians.&lt;lb/&gt; He also foresaw a permanent state of war among the three; a condition of&lt;lb/&gt; permanent stalemate with the alliances ever-shifting, but always two against&lt;lb/&gt; the strongest. This was the old-fashioned 'balance of power' system which&lt;lb/&gt; was used in ancient Greece, in medieval Italy, and in early modern Europe.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell's mistake lay in thinking there had to be actual war to keep the&lt;lb/&gt; merry-go-round of the balance of power in being. In fact, in one of the more&lt;lb/&gt; laughable parts of the book, he goes on and on concerning the necessity of&lt;lb/&gt; permanent war as a means of consuming the world's production of resources&lt;lb/&gt; and thus keeping the social stratification of upper, middle, and lower&lt;lb/&gt; classes in being. (This sounds like a very Leftist explanation of war as the&lt;lb/&gt; result of a conspiracy worked out with great difficulty.)&lt;lb/&gt; In actual fact, the decades since 1945 have been remarkably war-free as&lt;lb/&gt; compared with the decades before it. There have been local wars in&lt;lb/&gt; profusion, but no general war. But then, war is not required as a desperate&lt;lb/&gt; device to consume the world's resources. That can be done by such other&lt;lb/&gt; devices as endless increase in population and in energy use, neither of&lt;lb/&gt; which Orwell considers.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell did not foresee any of the significant economic changes that have&lt;lb/&gt; taken place since World War II. He did not foresee the role of oil or its&lt;lb/&gt; declining availability or its increasing price, or the escalating power of&lt;lb/&gt; those nations who control it. I don't recall his mentioning the word 'oil'.&lt;lb/&gt; But perhaps it is close enough to mark Orwellian prescience here, if we&lt;lb/&gt; substitute 'cold war' for 'war'. There has been, in fact, a more or less&lt;lb/&gt; continual 'cold war' that has served to keep employment high and solve some&lt;lb/&gt; short-term economic problems (at the cost of creating long-term greater&lt;lb/&gt; ones). And this cold war is enough to deplete resources.&lt;lb/&gt; Furthermore, the alliances shifted as Orwell foresaw and very nearly as&lt;lb/&gt; suddenly. When the United States seemed all-powerful, the Soviet Union and&lt;lb/&gt; China were both vociferously anti-American and in a kind of alliance. As&lt;lb/&gt; American power decreased, the Soviet Union and China fell apart and, for a&lt;lb/&gt; while, each of the three powers inveighed against the other two equally.&lt;lb/&gt; Then, when the Soviet Union came to seem particularly powerful, a kind of&lt;lb/&gt; alliance sprang up between the United States and China, as they co-operated&lt;lb/&gt; in vilifying the Soviet Union, and spoke softly of each other.&lt;lb/&gt; In 1984 every shift of alliance involved an orgy of history rewriting. In&lt;lb/&gt; real life, no such folly is necessary. The public swings from side to side&lt;lb/&gt; easily, accepting the change in circumstance with no concern for the past at&lt;lb/&gt; all. For instance, the Japanese, by the 1950s, had changed from unspeakable&lt;lb/&gt; villains to friends, while the Chinese moved in the opposite direction with&lt;lb/&gt; no one bothering to wipe out Pearl Harbour. No one cared, for goodness'&lt;lb/&gt; sake.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell has his three great powers voluntarily forgo the use of nuclear&lt;lb/&gt; bombs, and to be sure such bombs have not been used in war since 1945. That,&lt;lb/&gt; however, may be because the only powers with large nuclear arsenals, the&lt;lb/&gt; United States and the Soviet Union, have avoided war with each other. Were&lt;lb/&gt; there actual war, it is extremely doubtful that one side or the other would&lt;lb/&gt; not finally feel it necessary to push the button. In that respect, Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; perhaps falls short of reality.&lt;lb/&gt; London does, however, occasionally suffer a missile strike, which sounds&lt;lb/&gt; very much like a V-1 or V-2 weapon of 1944, and the city is in a 1945-type&lt;lb/&gt; shambles. Orwell cannot make 1984 very different from 1944 in this respect.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell, in fact, makes it clear that by 1984, the universal communism of&lt;lb/&gt; the three superpowers has choked science and reduced it to uselessness&lt;lb/&gt; except in those areas where it is needed for war. There is no question but&lt;lb/&gt; that the nations are more eager to invest in science where war applications&lt;lb/&gt; are in clear view but, alas, there is no way of separating war from peace&lt;lb/&gt; where applications are in question.&lt;lb/&gt; Science is a unit, and everything in it could conceivably be related to&lt;lb/&gt; war and destruction. Science has therefore not been choked off but continues&lt;lb/&gt; not only in the United States and Western Europe and Japan, but also in the&lt;lb/&gt; Soviet Union and in China. The advances of science are too numerous to&lt;lb/&gt; attempt to list, but think of lasers and computers as 'war weapons' with&lt;lb/&gt; infinite peaceful applications.&lt;lb/&gt; To summarise, then: George Orwell in 1984 was, in my opinion, engaging in&lt;lb/&gt; a private feud with Stalinism, rather that attempting to forecast the&lt;lb/&gt; future. He did not have the science fictional knack of foreseeing a&lt;lb/&gt; plausible future and, in actual fact, in almost all cases, the world of 1984&lt;lb/&gt; bears no relation to the real world of the 1980s.&lt;lb/&gt; The world may go communist, if not by 1984, then by some not very much&lt;lb/&gt; later date; or it may see civilisation destroyed. If this happens, however,&lt;lb/&gt; it will happen in a fashion quite different from that depicted in 1984 and&lt;lb/&gt; if we try to prevent either eventuality by imagining that 1984 is accurate,&lt;lb/&gt; then we will be defending ourselves against assaults from the wrong&lt;lb/&gt; direction and we will lose.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Cubans rendered powerless as outages persist and tensions with US escalate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SANTA CRUZ DEL NORTE, Cuba (AP) — The smell of sulfur hits hard in this coastal town that produces petroleum and is home to one of Cuba’s largest thermoelectric plants. Yet, even as the plant cranks back to life, residents remain in the dark, surrounded by energy sources they cannot use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As tensions deepen between Cuba and the U.S. after it attacked Venezuela and disrupted oil shipments, so have the woes of Santa Cruz del Norte.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People in this town east of Havana are plunged into darkness daily and forced to cook with coal and firewood, but not everyone can afford this new reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenia Montoya said she recently ripped the wooden door off her bathroom in the crumbling cinderblock home that she shares with her children because she needed firewood, and they needed to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Things are getting worse for us now,” she said. “They don’t supply us with petroleum. They don’t supply us with food. Where does that leave us, then?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A faded purple sheet now hangs over their bathroom. Nearby, only a handful of coal remains in a small bag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 50-year-old mother doesn’t know how she’ll cook once the coal runs out because supplies in the region have dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s one of many uncertainties gripping towns like this one across Cuba after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on any country that sells or provides oil to Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Well, it’s a failed nation now,” Trump said this week. “And they’re not getting any money from Venezuela, and they’re not getting any money from anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘How are we going to live?’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Near the main entrance to Santa Cruz del Norte, a sprawling mural is emblazoned with the following message in all caps: “NO ONE GIVES UP HERE. LONG LIVE A FREE CUBA.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But people wonder how long they can hold out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The island’s crisis is deepening: severe blackouts, soaring prices and a shortage of basic goods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Cuban government remains mum over its oil reserves, offering no word on whether Russia or anyone else would increase their shipments after oil supplies from Venezuela were disrupted when the U.S. attacked and arrested its president.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel described the situation as “complex” as he called the U.S. stance “aggressive and criminal,” saying it’s affecting things like transportation, hospitals, schools, tourism and the production of food.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said that in a week, he would provide details about how Cuba will deal with the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cuban officials recently lauded a phone call they had with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, although they did not share details. Meanwhile, Mexico has pledged to send humanitarian aid, including food, after Trump said he asked that it suspend oil shipments to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many in Santa Cruz del Norte feel the worst is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“With all those tariffs they’re going to impose on countries, no oil will come in, and how are we going to live?” said Gladys Delgado.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 67-year-old had cracked open her front door on a recent chilly afternoon to get some fresh air as she sewed small, colorful rugs made of clothing scraps to make extra cash because her pension is only $6 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of houses down, Minorkys Hoyos dropped a handful of cassava cubes into an old pot she filled with water from a barrel and placed it over a tiny, makeshift grill inside her home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You live with what you have,” she said, noting she had no other food available at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The few rechargeable items that used to light her small, disheveled home have broken down, and she began to bump into things until a neighbor gifted her an improvised lantern made with fuel and a reused baby food jar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When it’s dark, I don’t see,” said the 53-year-old diabetic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was late afternoon as she cooked, but her home was already dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outside, two children sat on a dusty sidewalk. They stacked dominoes one atop the other to see how high they could go before the whole thing tumbled down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘If only we could do something’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past three months, Santa Cruz del Norte had electricity while most of Cuba was hit with constant outages stemming from aging infrastructure and fuel shortages at power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People like Iván Amores were wary of rejoicing, fearful they would be plunged into the dark again like most of last year. Their fears materialized a week ago, when the outages hit again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This used to be wonderful,” he recalled of his town when it had electricity. “Now, it’s truly torture.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He uses a tiny, makeshift barbecue pit to cook for himself, his daughter and young granddaughter, buying pricier coal at $3 a bag because it generates less smoke inside their tidy home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amores also invested in a single tube light that a Cuban man in another town builds and sells; it can be charged and even comes with a USB port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even those kind of brilliant inventions Cubans are known for are out of reach for people like 67-year-old Mariela Viel; she and her husband still cannot afford to add a bathroom to their cinderblock home with a dirt floor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Growing up, Viel said she never knew what a blackout was: “We were living well. We had food, money.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She worked more than 40 years at the cafeteria of Cuba’s power company and now receives $8 a month in pension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What can I afford? Nothing. Not even a package of chicken,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When there’s power, she cooks rice and beans and listens to her favorite music: Cuban big bands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Viel sat outside one recent afternoon, watching a couple neighbors walk briskly with buckets of warmed up water so their families could take showers during a cold snap that began in late January, with a record low of 32 degrees (0 degrees) recorded in a town southeast of Santa Cruz del Norte.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Celebrations also start earlier now, with one family organizing a boy’s 15th birthday — a milestone age across Latin America — mid-afternoon before he and his friends opted to finish partying outdoors under a big yellow moon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It glowed on a group of people nearby who danced and sang outside next to a scooter blasting music from its speakers to celebrate the birthday of Olga Lilia Laurenti, now 61.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m telling you, whatever’s meant to be, let it be, because we can’t stop it,” she said as she paused dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re not going to waste part of your life on something that’s out of your control. If only we could do something, but what are we going to do? We can’t suffer. You need laughter, you need joy.”&lt;/p&gt;
