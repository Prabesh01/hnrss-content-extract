  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: None of this is written by AI, I’m still a real person writing my own blog like its 1999&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I finally figured out how to do Gigabit Ethernet over my existing phone wires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Powerline adapter and misery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve mostly lived with powerline adapters over recent years. Some worked well, some did not (try few and return what doesn’t work in your home). One I had for a while gave me stable 30 Mbps, which was little but good enough for internet at the time. I care very much about having stable low latency for gaming, more than bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to my current situation, that powerline adapter regularly lost connection which was a major problem. I got some new ones with the latest and greatest G.hn 2400 standard. The final contender served around 180 Mbps to my office (with high variance 120 to 280 Mbps), or around 80 Mbps to the top floor. It’s good enough to watch YouTube/TV yet it’s far from impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One peculiar thing from the UK: Internet providers don’t truly offer gigabit internet. They have a range of deals like 30 Mbps – 75 Mbps – 150 Mbps – 300 Mbps – 500 Mbps – 900 Mbps, each one costing a few more pounds per month than the last. This makes the UK simultaneously one of the cheapest and one of the most expensive countries to get Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long story short, new place, new hardware, new deals, the internet has been running at 500 Mbps for some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every 50 GB of Helldivers 2 update (because these idiots shipped the same content in duplicate 5 times) is a painful reminder that the setup is not operating at capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problem: How to get 500 Mbps to my room?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Fetish for Phone Sockets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been looking for a way to reuse phone wires for a while, because British houses are full of phone sockets. There are 2 sockets in my office room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough how much we love our phone sockets. It’s not uncommon to have a one bed flat with 2 phone sockets in the living room and 2 phone sockets in the bedroom and a master socket in the technical room. It’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new house bought today could have 10 phone sockets and 0 Ethernet sockets. There is still no regulation that requires new build to get Ethernet wiring (as far as I know).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s got to be a way to use the existing phone infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know the technology exists. It’s one of the rare cases where the technology exists and is mature, but nobody can be bothered to make products for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standards that run powerline adapters (HomePlug AV200, AV500, G.hn 2400) can work with any pair of wires. It should work ten times better on dedicated phone wires instead of noisy power wires, if only manufacturers could be bothered to pull their fingers out of their arse and make the products that are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After countless years of research, I finally found one German manufacturer that’s making what needs to be made https://www.gigacopper.net/wp/en/home-networking/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ordering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s made and shipped from Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was lazy so I ordered online in self-service (which is definitely the wrong way to go about it). It’s available on Ebay DE and Amazon DE, it’s possible to order from either with a UK account, make sure to enter a UK address for delivery (some items don’t allow it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The better approach is almost certainly to speak to the seller to get a quote, with international shipping and the import invoice excluding VAT (to avoid paying VAT on VAT).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Delivery Hell&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The package got the usual Royal Mail treatment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The package was shipped by DHL Germany&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The package was transferred to Royal Mail when entering the UK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After some days, the DHL website said they tried to deliver but nobody home, this is bullshit&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Royal website said the package reached the depot and was awaiting delivery, this is bullshit&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In reality, the package was stuck at the border, as usual&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Google to find “website to pay import fee on parcel”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;https://www.royalmail.com/receiving-mail/pay-a-fee&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Entered the DHL tracking number into the Royal Mail form for a Royal Mail tracking number&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The website said that the parcel had import fees to pay, this is correct&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Paid the fee online, 20% VAT + a few pounds of handling fees&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The package will be scheduled for delivery a few days later&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Royal Mail and DHL updated their status another two or three times with false information&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Royal Mail delivered a letter saying there was a package waiting on fees, though it was paid&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The package finally arrived&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, you need to follow the tracking regularly until the package is tagged as lost or failed delivery, which is the cue to pay import fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the normal procedure to buy things from Europe since Brexit 2020. It’s actually quite shocking that Royal Mail still hasn’t updated their tracking system to be able to give a status “waiting on import fees to be paid online”. They had 6 years!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Items&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the gigacopper G4201TM: 1 RJ11 phone line, 1 RJ45 gigabit Ethernet port, 1 power&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shopping list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A pair of gigacopper G4201TM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The device has a German power socket (expected)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It came with a German to UK power adapter (unexpected and useful)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It came with a standard RJ11 cable (expected and useless)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Found BT631A to RJ11 cables online (the standard UK phone socket)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Found Ethernet cables in my toolbox&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3M removable hanging strip to stick to the wall, the device is very light&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a gigacopper G4202TM: with an RJ45 to connect to the phone line instead of a RJ11 (not sure if it’s a newer model or just a variant, as that one has two gigabit Ethernet ports). Don’t be confused by having a RJ45 port that is not a RJ45 port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a gigacopper G4201C (1 port) and G4204C (4 port) for Ethernet over coaxial. Some countries have coax in every room for TV/satellite. This may be of interest to some readers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plugged it and it works!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full speed achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reminder, this is a 500 Mbps internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;InHome Variant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I discovered soon afterwards that I bought the wrong item. There is an InHome and a Client/Server variant of the product. Make sure to buy the InHome variant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The InHome variant can have up to 16 devices, communicating to any peer on the medium, with sub millisecond latency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The client-server variant is preconfigured as a pair, splitting the bandwidth 70% download / 30% upload, with few milliseconds latency. I think it’s a use case for ISP and long range connections.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully the difference is only the firmware. I spoke to the vendor who was very helpful and responsive. They sent me the firmware and the tools to patch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a fetish for low latency. This screenshot is oddly satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gigabit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The web interface says 1713 Mbps on the physical layer, the debugging tool says PHONE 200MHz – Connected 1385 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to verify whether the device can do a full Gigabit. Unfortunately I realized I don’t have any device that can test that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phones are wireless, which is too slow to test anything. I checked out of curiosity, my phone did 100 Mbps to 400 Mbps right next to the router. Grabbed two laptops only to realize they didn’t have any Ethernet port. I dug up an old laptop from storage with an Ethernet port. The laptop couldn’t boot, the CPU fan didn’t start and the laptop refused to boot with a dead fan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a hard lesson here: 1 Gbps ought to be enough for any home. Using the phone line is as good as having Ethernet wiring through the house if it can deliver a (shared) 1.7 Gbps link to multiple rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, I really wanted to verify that the device can do a full Gbps, I procured an USB-C to Ethernet adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full speed achieved, testing from a phone to a computer with iperf3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wiring&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some readers might wonder about the wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t check the wiring before buying anything because it’s pointless. British sockets are always daisy chained in an incomprehensible maze.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phone sockets need 2 wires and can be daisy chained. Ethernet sockets need 8 wires. They often use the same Cat5 cable because it’s the most widely available (8 wires cable, the 6 extra wires can remain unconnected).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible to swap the phone socket for an RJ45 socket, if you only have 2 sockets connected with the right cable. It’s not possible when sockets are daisy chained. (You could put a double or triple RJ45 socket with a switch to break a daisy chain, but it quickly becomes impractical in a British house with 5 to 10 sockets in an arbitrary layout.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I opened one socket in the office room. There are two Cat5 cables daisy chained. There are 3 wires connected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s probably daisy chained with the other socket in the room, or it’s daisy chained with the socket in the other room that’s closer. Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I opened the BT master socket in the technical room. It should have the cables coming from the other rooms. It should connect the internal phone wires with the external phone line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one single Cat5 cable. There are 4 wires connected. It’s definitely not a master socket. WTF?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that this socket has 4 wires connected but the socket in the office has 3 wires connected. The idiot who did the wiring was inconsistent. The gigacopper device can operate over 2 wires (200 MHz Phone SISO) or over 4 wires (100 MHz Phone MIMO). I can try the other modes if I finish the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The search for the master socket continues. The cables from the other floors should all be coming down somewhere around here. There is a blank plate next to it (right).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be the external phone line? A bunch of wires are crimped together, colours do not match. It’s the hell of a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only sure thing, they are different cables because they are different colours. They might be going to a junction box somewhere else. Probably behind a wall that’s impossible to access!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion: There is zero chance to get proper Ethernet wiring out of this mess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gigacopper device to do gigabit Ethernet over phone line is a miracle!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an enormous untapped market for gigabit Ethernet over phone sockets in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I estimate work as a staff software engineer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a kind of polite fiction at the heart of the software industry. It goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Estimating how long software projects will take is very hard, but not impossible. A skilled engineering team can, with time and effort, learn how long it will take for them to deliver work, which will in turn allow their organization to make good business plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is, of course, false. As every experienced software engineer knows, it is not possible to accurately estimate software projects. The tension between this polite fiction and its well-understood falseness causes a lot of strange activity in tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, many engineering teams estimate work in t-shirt sizes instead of time, because it just feels too obviously silly to the engineers in question to give direct time estimates. Naturally, these t-shirt sizes are immediately translated into hours and days when the estimates make their way up the management chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, software engineers who are genuinely trying to give good time estimates have ridiculous heuristics like “double your initial estimate and add 20%“. This is basically the same as giving up and saying “just estimate everything at a month”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should tech companies just stop estimating? One of my guiding principles is that when a tech company is doing something silly, they’re probably doing it for a good reason. In other words, practices that appear to not make sense are often serving some more basic, illegible role in the organization. So what is the actual purpose of estimation, and how can you do it well as a software engineer?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why estimation is impossible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I get into that, I should justify my core assumption a little more. People have written a lot about this already, so I’ll keep it brief.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m also going to concede that sometimes you can accurately estimate software work, when that work is very well-understood and very small in scope. For instance, if I know it takes half an hour to deploy a service1, and I’m being asked to update the text in a link, I can accurately estimate the work at something like 45 minutes: five minutes to push the change up, ten minutes to wait for CI, thirty minutes to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most of us, the majority of software work is not like this. We work on poorly-understood systems and cannot predict exactly what must be done in advance. Most programming in large systems is research: identifying prior art, mapping out enough of the system to understand the effects of changes, and so on. Even for fairly small changes, we simply do not know what’s involved in making the change until we go and look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pro-estimation dogma says that these questions ought to be answered during the planning process, so that each individual piece of work being discussed is scoped small enough to be accurately estimated. I’m not impressed by this answer. It seems to me to be a throwback to the bad old days of software architecture, where one architect would map everything out in advance, so that individual programmers simply had to mechanically follow instructions. Nobody does that now, because it doesn’t work: programmers must be empowered to make architectural decisions, because they’re the ones who are actually in contact with the code2. Even if it did work, that would simply shift the impossible-to-estimate part of the process backwards, into the planning meeting (where of course you can’t write or run code, which makes it near-impossible to accurately answer the kind of questions involved).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short: software engineering projects are not dominated by the known work, but by the unknown work, which always takes 90% of the time. However, only the known work can be accurately estimated. It’s therefore impossible to accurately estimate software projects in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Estimates do not come from engineers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates do not help engineering teams deliver work more efficiently. Many of the most productive years of my career were spent on teams that did no estimation at all: we were either working on projects that had to be done no matter what, and so didn’t really need an estimate, or on projects that would deliver a constant drip of value as we went, so we could just keep going indefinitely3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a very real sense, estimates aren’t even made by engineers at all. If an engineering team comes up with a long estimate for a project that some VP really wants, they will be pressured into lowering it (or some other, more compliant engineering team will be handed the work). If the estimate on an undesirable project - or a project that’s intended to “hold space” for future unplanned work - is too short, the team will often be encouraged to increase it, or their manager will just add a 30% buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One exception to this is projects that are technically impossible, or just genuinely prohibitively difficult. If a manager consistently fails to pressure their teams into giving the “right” estimates, that can send a signal up that maybe the work can’t be done after all. Smart VPs and directors will try to avoid taking on technically impossible projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another exception to this is areas of the organization that senior leadership doesn’t really care about. In a sleepy backwater, often the formal estimation process does actually get followed to the letter, because there’s no director or VP who wants to jump in and shape the estimates to their ends. This is one way that some parts of a tech company can have drastically different engineering cultures to other parts. I’ll let you imagine the consequences when the company is re-orged and these teams are pulled into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates are political tools for non-engineers in the organization. They help managers, VPs, directors, and C-staff decide on which projects get funded and which projects get cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Estimates define the work, not the other way around&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard way of thinking about estimates is that you start with a proposed piece of software work, and you then go and figure out how long it will take. This is entirely backwards. Instead, teams will often start with the estimate, and then go and figure out what kind of software work they can do to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose you’re working on a LLM chatbot, and your director wants to implement “talk with a PDF”. If you have six months to do the work, you might implement a robust file upload system, some pipeline to chunk and embed the PDF content for semantic search, a way to extract PDF pages as image content to capture formatting and diagrams, and so on. If you have one day to do the work, you will naturally search for simpler approaches: for instance, converting the PDF to text client-side and sticking the entire thing in the LLM context, or offering a plain-text “grep the PDF” tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is true at even at the level of individual lines of code. When you have weeks or months until your deadline, you might spend a lot of time thinking airily about how you could refactor the codebase to make your new feature fit in as elegantly as possible. When you have hours, you will typically be laser-focused on finding an approach that will actually work. There are always many different ways to solve software problems. Engineers thus have quite a lot of discretion about how to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How I estimate work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do I estimate, given all that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I gather as much political context as possible before I even look at the code. How much pressure is on this project? Is it a casual ask, or do we have to find a way to do this? What kind of estimate is my management chain looking for? There’s a huge difference between “the CTO really wants this in one week” and “we were looking for work for your team and this seemed like it could fit”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally, I go to the code with an estimate already in hand. Instead of asking myself “how long would it take to do this”, where “this” could be any one of a hundred different software designs, I ask myself “which approaches could be done in one week?“.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spend more time worrying about unknowns than knowns. As I said above, unknown work always dominates software projects. The more “dark forests” in the codebase this feature has to touch, the higher my estimate will be - or, more concretely, the tighter I need to constrain the set of approaches to the known work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I go back to my manager with a risk assessment, not with a concrete estimate. I don’t ever say “this is a four-week project”. I say something like “I don’t think we’ll get this done in one week, because X Y Z would need to all go right, and at least one of those things is bound to take a lot more work than we expect. Ideally, I go back to my manager with a series of plans, not just one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We tackle X Y Z directly, which might all go smoothly but if it blows out we’ll be here for a month&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We bypass Y and Z entirely, which would introduce these other risks but possibly allow us to hit the deadline&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We bring in help from another team who’s more familiar with X and Y, so we just have to focus on Z&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, I don’t “break down the work to determine how long it will take”. My management chain already knows how long they want it to take. My job is to figure out the set of software approaches that match that estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes that set is empty: the project is just impossible, no matter how you slice it. In that case, my management chain needs to get together and figure out some way to alter the requirements. But if I always said “this is impossible”, my managers would find someone else to do their estimates. When I do that, I’m drawing on a well of trust that I build up by making pragmatic estimates the rest of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Addressing some objections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many engineers find this approach distasteful. One reason is that they don’t like estimating in conditions of uncertainty, so they insist on having all the unknown questions answered in advance. I have written a lot about this in Engineers who won’t commit and How I provide technical clarity to non-technical leaders, but suffice to say that I think it’s cowardly. If you refuse to estimate, you’re forcing someone less technical to estimate for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some engineers think that their job is to constantly push back against engineering management, and that helping their manager find technical compromises is betraying some kind of sacred engineering trust. I wrote about this in Software engineers should be a little bit cynical. If you want to spend your career doing that, that’s fine, but I personally find it more rewarding to find ways to work with my managers (who have almost exclusively been nice people).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other engineers might say that they rarely feel this kind of pressure from their directors or VPs to alter estimates, and that this is really just the sign of a dysfunctional engineering organization. Maybe! I can only speak for the engineering organizations I’ve worked in. But my suspicion is that these engineers are really just saying that they work “out of the spotlight”, where there’s not much pressure in general and teams can adopt whatever processes they want. There’s nothing wrong with that. But I don’t think it qualifies you to give helpful advice to engineers who do feel this kind of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think software engineering estimation is generally misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common view is that a manager proposes some technical project, the team gets together to figure out how long it would take to build, and then the manager makes staffing and planning decisions with that information. In fact, it’s the reverse: a manager comes to the team with an estimate already in hand (though they might not come out and admit it), and then the team must figure out what kind of technical project might be possible within that estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is because estimates are not by or for engineering teams. They are tools used for managers to negotiate with each other about planned work. Very occasionally, when a project is literally impossible, the estimate can serve as a way for the team to communicate that fact upwards. But that requires trust. A team that is always pushing back on estimates will not be believed when they do encounter a genuinely impossible proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I estimate, I extract the range my manager is looking for, and only then do I go through the code and figure out what can be done in that time. I never come back with a flat “two weeks” figure. Instead, I come back with a range of possibilities, each with their own risks, and let my manager make that tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not possible to accurately estimate software work. Software projects spend most of their time grappling with unknown problems, which by definition can’t be estimated in advance. To estimate well, you must therefore basically ignore all the known aspects of the work, and instead try and make educated guesses about how many unknowns there are, and how scary each unknown is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edit: I should thank one of my readers, Karthik, who emailed me to ask about estimates, thus revealing to me that I had many more opinions than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone wincing at that time, I mean like three minutes of actual deployment and twenty-seven minutes of waiting for checks to pass or monitors to turn up green.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I write a lot more about this in You can’t design software you don’t work on.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, imagine a mandate to improve the performance of some large Rails API, one piece at a time. I could happily do that kind of work forever.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How I provide technical clarity to non-technical leaders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mission as a staff engineer is to provide technical clarity to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I do other stuff too. I run projects, I ship code, I review PRs, and so on. But the most important thing I do - what I’m for - is to provide technical clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an organization, technical clarity is when non-technical decision makers have a good-enough practical understanding of what changes they can make to their software systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/quote&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;200 SQL statements per webpage is excessive for client/server database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But with SQLite, 200 or more SQL statement per webpage is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite can also do large and complex queries efficiently, just like client/server databases. But SQLite can do many smaller queries efficiently too. Application developers can use whichever technique works best for the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Appropriate Uses For SQLite page says that dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL statements each. This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"[This is] bad design"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. In a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message round-trip from the application to the database server and back to the application. Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially, can be a serious performance drag. This is sometimes called the "N+1 Query Problem" or the "N+1 Select Problem" and it is an anti-pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite is not client/server, however. The SQLite database runs in the same process address space as the application. Queries do not involve message round-trips, only a function call. The latency of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite. Hence, using a large number of queries with SQLite is not the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dynamic webpages on the SQLite website are mostly generated by the Fossil version control system. A typical dynamic page would be a timeline such as https://sqlite.org/src/timeline. A log of all SQL used by the timeline is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first group of queries in the log are extracting display options from the "config" and "global_config" tables of the Fossil database. Then there is a single complex query that extracts a list of all elements to be displayed on the timeline. This "timeline" query demonstrates that SQLite can easily process complex relational database queries involving multiple tables, subqueries, and complex WHERE clause constraints, and it can make effective use of indexes to solve the queries with minimal disk I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the single big "timeline" query, there are additional queries for each timeline element. Fossil is using the "N+1 Query" pattern rather than trying to grab all the information in as few queries as possible. But that is ok because there is no unnecessary IPC overhead. At the bottom of each timeline page, Fossil shows approximately how long it took to generate the page. For a 50-entry timeline, the latency is usually less than 25 milliseconds. Profiling shows that few of those milliseconds were spent inside the database engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the N+1 Query pattern in Fossil does not harm the application. But the N+1 Query pattern does have benefits. For one, the section of the code that creates the timeline query can be completely separate from the section that prepares each timeline entry for display. This provides a separation of responsibility that helps keep the code simple and easy to maintain. Secondly, the information needed for display, and the queries needed to extract that information, vary according to what type of objects are to be shown. Check-ins need one set of queries. Tickets need another set of queries. Wiki pages need a different query. And so forth. By implementing these queries on-demand and in the part of the code dealing with the various entities, there is further separation of responsibility and simplification of the overall code base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, SQLite is able to do one or two large and complex queries, or it can do many smaller and simpler queries. Both are efficient. An application can use either or both techniques, depending on what works best for the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following is a log of all SQL used to generate one particular timeline (captured on 2016-09-16):&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Microsoft confirms it will give the FBI your Windows PC data encryption key if asked — you can thank Windows 11's forced online accounts for that&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 11's online Microsoft Account requirement means your PC is automatically backing up its data encryption key to the cloud, and Microsoft says it will hand those over to the FBI if requested via legal order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has confirmed in a statement to Forbes that the company will provide the FBI access to BitLocker encryption keys if a valid legal order is requested. These keys enable the ability to decrypt and access the data on a computer running Windows, giving law enforcement the means to break into a device and access its data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The news comes as Forbes reports that Microsoft gave the FBI the BitLocker encryption keys to access a device in Guam that law enforcement believed to have "evidence that would help prove individuals handling the island’s Covid unemployment assistance program were part of a plot to steal funds" in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was possible because the device in question had its BitLocker encryption key saved in the cloud. By default, Windows 11 forces the use of a Microsoft Account, and the OS will automatically tie your BitLocker encryption key to your online account so that users can easily recover their data in scenarios where they might get locked out. This can be disabled, letting you choose where to save them locally, but the default behavior is to store the key in Microsoft's cloud when setting up a PC with a Microsoft Account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"While key recovery offers convenience, it also carries a risk of unwanted access, so Microsoft believes customers are in the best position to decide... how to manage their keys,” Microsoft spokesperson Charles Chamberlayne said in a statement to Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft told Forbes that it receives around 20 requests for BitLocker encryption keys from the FBI a year, but the majority of requests are unable to be met because the encryption key was never uploaded to the company's cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is notable as other tech companies, such as Apple, have famously refused to provide law enforcement with access to encrypted data stored on their products. Apple has openly fought against the FBI in the past when it was asked to provide a backdoor into an iPhone. Other tech giants, such as Meta, will store encryption keys in the cloud, but use zero-knowledge architectures and encrypt the keys server-side so that only the user can access them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's frankly shocking that the encryption keys that do get uploaded to Microsoft aren't encrypted on the cloud side, too. That would prevent Microsoft from seeing the keys, but it seems that, as things currently stand, those keys are available in an unencrypted state, and it is a privacy nightmare for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see Microsoft so willingly hand over the keys to encrypted Windows PCs is concerning, and should make everybody using a modern Windows computer think twice before backing up their keys to the cloud. You can see which PCs have their BitLocker keys stored on Microsoft's servers on the Microsoft Account website here, which will let you delete them if present.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Greetings, this is the official XHTML club (and blog)! This website is both a collection of XHTML valid websites and a simple blog; a lonely software developer screaming out into the abyss of the internet. Ranting and raving about the ever increasing bloat that is the "modern" web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simply put: it's a collection of XHTML valid websites. That's it. There's no "classic web" manifesto or any call to "return to the days of the old internet!". This is just a place where valid XHTML is respected, even if the rest of the internet has long since moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I fully understand how pointless this might seem to some people. XHTML has long been replaced, with HTML5 being the current king of the hypertext markup world. Validation is ignored, and most modern sites are built with little concern for structure or longevity. Today's web is severely lacking in quality craftsmanship. Still, there's value in doing things properly, even when it's scoffed at by modern age internet users. XHTML Club isn't here to shame or persuade, instead my hope is to make you more aware about the quality of your HTML. It's here to show that valid markup still exists and that some of us still care enough to build it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Kept and the Killed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of the 270,000 photographs commissioned by the US Farm Security Administration to document the Great Depression, more than a third were “killed”. Erica X Eisen examines the history behind this hole-punched archive and the unknowable void at its center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;January 26, 2022&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first killed negative I encounter is of a field. It’s a Carl Mydans shot, and a drought has reduced the land to a flat, cracked expanse out of which only a few tenacious scraggles of crabgrass have managed to sprout. Nothing notable here, no action, no grand geometries — except that the center of the negative has been pierced by a perfect circle, as though in counterpoint to the sprocket holes running along the photo’s edge. Briefly I imagine that this circle is what has doomed the land, a well into which all the precious waters must have run. Months after coming across the photograph, it is that void, more than any peripheral scenery, which remains anchored in my memory — that and the caption describing the picture as “killed”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Begun as part of the alphabet soup of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal policies, the Farm Security Administration (FSA), under the aegis of which Mydans’ ill-fated photo was taken, had been tasked with resettling struggling farmers onto more fertile ground, providing education about agricultural science, and giving loans for the purchase of land, feed, and livestock. Arguably its most enduring legacy today, however, is the hundreds of thousands of photographs the agency1 produced to document the plight of destitute farmers, many of whom were trapped in an inescapable pit of debt made deeper still by the environmental devastation of the Dust Bowl. The project’s head, Roy Emerson Stryker (1893–1975), would shop his favorites around, going from newsroom to newsroom “with pictures under his arm”, as Dorothea Lange would later recall, in an attempt to secure placements in major papers.2 Stryker had encyclopedic ambitions: tasked with the mission of “introducing America to Americans”, the FSA’s photography wing would soon see its remit balloon far past images of rural poverty to encompass everything from aerial shots of utopian building projects to Kodachrome still lifes — all of which could find a home within what Stryker called simply the File.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet despite the File’s colossal scope, there were still images that Stryker deemed unfit for inclusion. These photographs had to be, in his parlance, “killed” — marked for exclusion, usually with a merciless hole-punch through the middle. By the time the project came to a close, the FSA’s photographers had captured some 270,000 images, of which a staggering 100,000 were killed.4 These include work by pioneering Black filmmaker and photographer Gordon Parks; by Russell Lee, who would go on to document the internment of Japanese Americans during the Second World War; by Marion Post Wolcott, the FSA’s first full-time female photographer. They also include images of which not even a punctured trace survives. Stryker only used the hole-punch method on 35mm negatives; when presented with sheet film he felt was unsuitable, he simply discarded it.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stryker’s career had a ping-pong trajectory: he dropped out of the Colorado School of Mines to become a rancher before being shipped off to fight in World War I, then returned to the U.S. and studied economics at Columbia. There, he researched utopian socialism with Rexford Tugwell, a professor whose emphasis on the pedagogical and psychological impact of visual aids left an impression on Stryker. After Tugwell became part of Roosevelt’s “Brain Trust” of key advisers, he called upon his former student to join him in Washington and head up the photography arm of the Resettlement Administration, which, in 1937, was folded into the Farm Security Administration.6 Though not a photographer himself, Stryker nevertheless had a clearly defined sense of the medium as an instrument of social action and knew what he liked and did not like in an image. He would often send his photographers into the field armed with pages-long scripts detailing what exactly he wanted them to capture, itemized lists that sometimes approached aphoristic form: “The baseball diamond as an important part of our general landscape”; “Pressed clothes”; “The wall decorations in homes as an index to the different income groups and their reactions”; “Old tires piles”; “(What will happen to the roadside hamburger stand?)”; “Pictures of men, women, and children who appear as if they really believed in the U.S.”7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stryker’s editorial philosophy occasionally brought him into conflict with the photographers he employed. His refusal to use the captions Lange painstakingly composed for her own images greatly frustrated her (despite praising Migrant Mother as the pinnacle of the FSA photography program’s output, Stryker would fire Lange on three separate occasions).8 Photographer Edwin Rosskam remarked bitterly that Stryker’s hole-punching habit “was barbaric to me. . . I'm sure that some very significant pictures have in that way been killed off, because there is no way of telling, no way, what photograph would come alive when”.9 Another FSA staffer, Ben Shahn, referred to Stryker’s style as “a little bit dictatorial”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;He ruined quite a number of my pictures. . . . Some of them were incredibly valuable. He didn't understand at the time. . . . Later on, during the war . . . I went to look for [a] negative and he[‘d] punched a hole through it. Well, I shot my mouth off about that. But, I didn't know what was done with a lot of my negatives, naturally. He learned, then, not to do that, you see, because this was an invaluable document of what life was like in 1935 and when I was looking for it in 1943 or '44 it didn't exist anymore.10&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A chastened Stryker eventually granted veto power to photographers over which of their images would be killed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time he took a job at the Pittsburgh Photography Library in the 1950s, Stryker had transitioned to indicating killed negatives by having them pasted onto cards marked with an incongruously cutesy blue star. Sometimes, however, the old temptation for more abrasive methods seemed to take hold — other cards were branded by a special KILL stamp. In still other cases the destroying angel seems to have taken Stryker over completely and caused him to slash across the doomed images in marker.11 Even those pictures that he favored were not immune from these kinds of interventions: squiggles, lines, and written notes instructed his employees to crop and straighten, addenda that sometimes smudged and marred the photo Stryker was trying to perfect.12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the negatives Stryker killed, by all accounts, were redundancies nixed in favor of a similar image with stronger composition, clearer focus, and facial expressions better comporting with the themes of suffering and endurance he sought to draw out of the FSA’s subjects. Shot through, these unloved alternates have become almost more interesting than their perfect twins. In contrast to the carefully captioned File images, killed negatives have no names attached, often no notes on provenance: what little we know about them is only by analogy to those photos that were saved, clues about location gleaned from landscapes, clothing, faces. As such, the killed photos demand a more active viewer, one willing to piece together, to parse, to consign some things to the realm of the curious and unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did Stryker give much thought as to where to put the hole through when he made his killings? These voids obliterate the hand of a little boy in fringed gloves who stares back calmly at his shooter; they slice through the pavement of an unnamed street where a pair of identical twins walks on unawares. They run like a sniper’s bullet through the legs of a man bending over to pick a fruit, whizz past the ear of a cop. A black hole tarnishes the pale lapel of a floppy-bonneted woman as she looks the other way; it hovers over a man’s head like a grim fate narrowly avoided. In one rare example, a vicious flurry of perforations strafes an entire family of Arkansas sharecroppers as the mother tends to her youngest. The void slates houses for destruction, theaters, water pumps, a cotton bale straining at the corset of its ties. It hangs aloft and lightless over a Chocowinity field like a sun negated. The same person is killed and killed again, from one picture to the next. When one views these photos as a series, the holes begin to feel like a vengeful god too terrible to figure. Once capturing social history, these images now seem to conjure that moment just prior to disaster: before the hole shatters the glass, pops the tire, forces the horse to give one final whinny, kick out uselessly, and fall to the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Punning on the pinhole history of early photographic technologies like the camera obscura, Roland Barthes used the word punctum (literally, “sting, speck, cut, little hole”) to name the disarming effect of certain images. “A photograph’s punctum”, he wrote, “is that accident which pricks me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me)”.13 In the killed negatives, we find Barthes’ dictum literalized: it is the little hole or holes themselves that arrest our eyes and imagination. The strange contradiction at the heart of the killed negatives — as the very existence of this essay attests — is that in an important sense they weren’t killed: the hole-punched photos remain in the Library of Congress, preserved by Stryker himself, and the Pittsburgh Photography Library images deemed unfit for the archives have instead come to comprise their own separate archive in the same building, a sort of Salon des Refusés. Allen Benson writes that the “entombment” of these images “produces a contradictory effect, a desire to look, to open the killed storage boxes and inspect the remains”.14 When we do look, we find that, whatever the organic center of the original photo’s gravity may be, the void has usurped it and become, suddenly, the focal point. In the subtle but unmistakable way that Stryker’s puncture marks reveal the three-dimensional negative from which each two-dimensional image is printed, they call our attention to the fact that a photograph is a physical object and a fragile one at that. And yet at the same time it’s difficult not to feel a visceral reel as a hole slices through the head of a child, the face of a young mother. Stryker’s rejects present us with a push-pull of mimesis: the scenes become less real even as they become more emotionally immediate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we wish to examine what images Stryker thought ultimately worthy of keeping, we must also consider the question of what images he thought were worth taking in the first place. Groups like Latinos and Native Americans, for instance, are underrepresented in the File.15 In a 1937 letter to Lange while she was on assignment photographing tenant farmers in Texas, Stryker advised her to “take both black and white, but place the emphasis on the white tenants, since we know that these will receive much wider use”.16 That latter part was indeed borne out by the fact that exhibitions and newspapers more readily selected white images from the File than non-white.17 More broadly, the FSA’s focus on the madonna, the stoic striver, elevated a certain class of “deserving poor” above those who were beyond the bounds both of being photographed and receiving material aid.18 For the government, of course, these two things were tightly interwoven: the purpose of the FSA’s photography program, after all, was to drum up support for the New Deal among an American public that had long viewed poverty as a moral stain. In the course of resettling white tenant farmers in the Mississippi Delta, the FSA forcibly uprooted Black families throughout the region — families whose suffering, it appears, did not rate high enough to make it into the File.19 When I viewed Stryker’s negatives together, they seemed to be posing questions not just about the work of the FSA but about the future of the country they sought to document: both “who should get a farm loan?” and “who cuts a heroic enough figure to advertise them?” Not only “whose grief do we recognize?”, but also “whose grief is deserving of succor?” Who will be kept and who will be killed? Who will survive in America — and what image of this land will these survivors bear into the future?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Memory Layout in Zig with Formulas&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was recently encouraged to watch A Practical Guide to Applying Data Oriented Design (DoD) by Andrew Kelley, the creator of Zig1. Just 10 minutes into the talk, I was confronted with a skill I had never formally learned… the arithmetic behind memory layout of types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the talk, Andrew tested the audience’s ability to compute the alignment and sizes of various types, starting with primitives like &lt;code&gt;u32&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;, and ending with some more complex structures involving enums, unions, and more. As far as I can tell, the exact rules for computing the alignment and size of a type in Zig are not made explicit in any documentation, but are understood by those in-the-know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a late-comer to low-level programming myself, I thought I’d collect here some formulas &amp;amp; explanations I landed on while wrestling with alignment and sizing in Zig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory Layout Principles&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any piece of data stored in memory on a computer, the data must have some natural alignment and size dimensions according to its type. Intuitively, its size captures how many bytes it would take to specify the information that should be contained in any instance of that type. Whereas, its alignment captures the spacing the compiler must obey when choosing valid addresses at which to place data of this type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I imagine just about any computer science major would have learned the rules of memory layout according to some kind of C-like compiler. I guess the motivation would go something like: “CPUs fetch data from memory in fixed-size blocks of so-many bytes, and performance degrades when data is misaligned. So, compilers automatically pad and align data types.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, types that don’t “fill up” all of the space in memory allocated to them will be padded with extra bits/bytes to make up for the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew’s whole message in his DoD talk centered on designing your data types to take up as little space in memory as possible, which includes reducing the size, alignment, and padding required to represent the same information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably, the formulas I propose below apply to similar languages beyond Zig and my machine’s (Apple) ABI, but I make no claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zig language exposes two builtin functions relevant to our discussion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;@alignOf(comptime T: type): #bytes required for aligning this type in memory (valid addresses for this type will be multiples of this value);&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;@sizeOf(comptime T: type): #bytes for storing the type in memory (including padding).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll use the following function &lt;code&gt;memory_printout&lt;/code&gt; to report these values for any type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");

fn memory_printout(T: type) void {
    std.debug.print("@alignOf( {s} ): {d}\t", .{ @typeName(T), @alignOf(T) });
    std.debug.print("@sizeOf( {s} ): {d}\n", .{ @typeName(T), @sizeOf(T) });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory Layout Formulas&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, one helpful invariant is offered in Zig’s documentation. For any type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Primitives&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, the primitive data types will teach us a good bit about memory layout. Try guessing the results of the following Zig code before looking at the answer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pub fn main() void {
    const types = [_]type{ bool, c_char, u8, *u8, u16, u17, i32, f64, usize };
    inline for (types) |T| memory_printout(T);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;The Output:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;@alignOf( bool ): 1       @sizeOf( bool ): 1
@alignOf( c_char ): 1     @sizeOf( c_char ): 1
@alignOf( u8 ): 1         @sizeOf( u8 ): 1
@alignOf( *u8 ): 8        @sizeOf( *u8 ): 8
@alignOf( u16 ): 2        @sizeOf( u16 ): 2
@alignOf( u17 ): 4        @sizeOf( u17 ): 4
@alignOf( i32 ): 4        @sizeOf( i32 ): 4
@alignOf( f64 ): 8        @sizeOf( f64 ): 8
@alignOf( usize ): 8      @sizeOf( usize ): 8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests the following formula for primitive data types:&lt;/p&gt;\[\texttt{@sizeOf(primitive)} = \texttt{@alignOf(primitive)}.\]&lt;p&gt;Most of these make sense. A &lt;code&gt;c_char&lt;/code&gt; truly requires 8 bits, or 1 byte to specify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas, a &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; comprises a single bit (information-theoretically). But, alignment and size are measured in whole bytes, so we should round up to the nearest byte (and pad with 7 bits to fill up that byte).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, any unsigned integer &lt;code&gt;u{b}&lt;/code&gt;, signed integer &lt;code&gt;i{b}&lt;/code&gt;, or floating-point number &lt;code&gt;f{b}&lt;/code&gt; contains $b$ bits of information. So, counting in bytes, we will have to round $b / 8$ up, somehow. But, look at &lt;code&gt;u17&lt;/code&gt;: despite $2 &amp;lt; 17 / 8 \leq 3$, the size of &lt;code&gt;u17&lt;/code&gt; is not 3 bytes. Instead, it’s 4 bytes. In general, alignment and size must be powers-of-2 bytes. This is another desirable property half-dictated by architecture and half-related to the convenience of powers of two. So, we actually always round up to the nearest power-of-2 bytes when converting from bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s formalize this conversion from bits to bytes for good:&lt;/p&gt;\[\begin{aligned} \texttt{bytes}(\texttt{bits}) &amp;amp;:= \max\left\{1, 2^{\left\lceil\log_2(\frac{\texttt{bits}}{8}) \right\rceil}\right\}. \end{aligned}\]&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of alignment and size being powers of two is the following, stronger invariant. For any type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, the size of the type is always a multiple of its alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up, depending on your architecture, &lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt; will either match &lt;code&gt;u32&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt;. I’m working on a 64-bit machine, so that’s why we see its size and alignment as 8 bytes. Moreover, any pointer (such as &lt;code&gt;*u8&lt;/code&gt;) represents an address, which is guaranteed by Zig to match &lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For primitive data types, remember: their size and align values agree and equal the smallest power-of-2 many bytes required to represent that type in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Structs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Zig, a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; combines many fields into a single data type. How does memory layout work when many fields are combined together?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Zig automatically minimizes the memory footprint of a struct by possibly shuffling around its fields. To force the Zig compiler to respect the order of the fields as we’ve defined them, we may use the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;keyword as shown below. Really, this forces the compiler to obey C ABI compatibility.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, rest assured that structs add no overhead. That is, if &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is a type, and we define:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const struct_T = struct {
  field: T,
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;then &lt;code&gt;@alignOf(struct_T) == @alignOf(T)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@sizeOf(struct_T) == @sizeOf(T)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, when a struct envelops two fields, such as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const pair = extern struct {
  a: u8,
  b: u32,
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;we should consider the meanings of align and size again:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The alignment of the struct &lt;code&gt;pair&lt;/code&gt;should be such that any offset by this alignment value does not break the alignment of its constituent fields&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Here, field &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;has a stricter alignment of 4 bytes, whereas&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;permits offsets of 1 byte. So,&lt;code&gt;pair&lt;/code&gt;better also only permit alignments of 4 bytes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Here, field &lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The size of the struct &lt;code&gt;pair&lt;/code&gt;is dictated by its alignment. Its memory will necessarily take up a number of bytes which is a multiple of its alignment. To figure out exactly how many, we iterate through the fields in order, trying our best to greedily pack those fields while still respecting their own alignments.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Here, the size of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;is just one byte, so it fits into a single memory chunk of size 4 bytes (the alignment of&lt;code&gt;pair&lt;/code&gt;is 4 bytes), with three bytes to spare. Now, we consider the next field:&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. As its alignment is 4 bytes, we can only write&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;at an address which is a multiple of its own alignment. The soonest we can accomplish this is by padding three bytes after&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;and writing&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;at the fourth byte. This already places&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;into another 4-byte memory chunk, in which it fits entirely as its size is 4 bytes. So, the total size of&lt;code&gt;pair&lt;/code&gt;is 8 bytes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Here, the size of &lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, what do you expect the output of the following Zig code to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pub fn main() void {
    memory_printout(ABAB);
    memory_printout(ABBA);
}

const ABAB = extern struct {
    a1: u8,
    b1: u16,
    a2: u8,
    b2: u16,
};

const ABBA = extern struct {
    a1: u8,
    a2: u8,
    b1: u16,
    b2: u16,
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;The Answer:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;@alignOf( ABAB ): 2      @sizeOf( ABAB ): 8
@alignOf( ABBA ): 2      @sizeOf( ABBA ): 6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, deciding the placement of a struct field follows this rule:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rule: Each field is placed after the previous field at the next smallest multiple of its own alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the formula for rounding a number $N$ up to the nearest multiple of some other number $m$ looks like:&lt;/p&gt;\[\texttt{next_mult}(N, m) := \left\lceil \frac{N}{m} \right\rceil \cdot m.\\\]&lt;p&gt;Given this, try to follow the next example. We make use of another Zig builtin &lt;code&gt;@offsetOf(&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;field_name&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt; to display exactly where each field is placed in memory relative to the beginning address of &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fn printOffset(T: type, comptime f: [:0]const u8) void {
    std.debug.print("@offsetOf( {s} ) = {d}\n", .{ f, @offsetOf(T, f) });
}

pub fn main() void {
  memory_printout(S);
  printOffset(S, "a");
  printOffset(S, "b");
  printOffset(S, "c");
}

const S = extern struct {
    // align = size = 2
    a: u16,
    // align = 2, size = 6
    b: extern struct { b1: u16, b2: u16, b3: u16 },
    // align = size = 4
    c: u32,
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;Output:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;@alignOf( S ): 4        @sizeOf( S ): 12
@offsetOf( a ) = 0
@offsetOf( b ) = 2
@offsetOf( c ) = 8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, alignment for structs is quite simple to formulate:&lt;/p&gt;\[\texttt{@alignOf(struct)} := \max_{\texttt{fields}} \texttt{@alignOf(field)}.\]&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the size of the (externed) struct is more complicated: $\texttt{@sizeOf(struct)}$ is the smallest multiple of $\texttt{@alignOf(struct)}$ many bytes required to fit the fields of a struct (in order) such that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;No two fields overlap in memory, and&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Each field lies at an address which is a multiple of its own alignment: $\texttt{@alignOf(field)}$.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; keyword, Zig minimizes the size of the struct under all permutations of its fields. Zig also offers &lt;code&gt;packed struct&lt;/code&gt;, which eliminates padding entirely and lays out fields in strict bit-order. While this can reduce memory usage further, it comes with performance trade-offs and restrictions on field access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus question: Try to explain why the choice to make alignments and sizes be powers of two is vital for these rules to be well-defined for assessing the alignment and size of structs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enums&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, an enum works on indices, not labels. So, the alignment and size of an enum will equal the minimal number of bytes to express the type of its indices. Suppose &lt;code&gt;T = enum (u{b}) { ... }&lt;/code&gt; is an arbitrary enum indexed by unsigned integers of type &lt;code&gt;u{b}&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is measured in bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: we may use the Zig standard library to access the number of options in the enum as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;std.meta.fields(T).len&lt;/code&gt;. I’ll call this $\texttt{T.len}$, below.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: By default, Zig’s compiler assigns indices starting at zero and counting up by one. So, by default, Zig sets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;to $\lceil \log_2 (\texttt{T.len}) \rceil$.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then,&lt;/p&gt;\[\begin{aligned} \texttt{@alignOf(enum(u{b}))} &amp;amp;= \texttt{@alignOf(u{b})} = \texttt{bytes}(\texttt{b}),\\ \texttt{@sizeOf(enum(u{b}))} &amp;amp;= \texttt{@sizeOf(u{b})} = \texttt{bytes}(\texttt{b}). \end{aligned}\]&lt;p&gt;We’ve made use of the $\texttt{bytes}$ function, again2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const T_default = enum { a, b, c, d, e };
const T_long = enum(u64) { a, b, c, d, e };

memory_printout(T_default);
memory_printout(T_long);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;Output:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;@alignOf( T_default ): 1    @sizeOf( T_default ): 1
@alignOf( T_long ): 8       @sizeOf( T_long ): 8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Arrays and Slices&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an array in Zig, its alignment inherits from that of its elements, and its size is just length$\times$size of the type:&lt;/p&gt;\[\begin{aligned} \texttt{@alignOf([N]T)} &amp;amp;= \texttt{@alignOf(T)},\\ \texttt{@sizeOf([N]T)} &amp;amp;= \texttt{N} \cdot \texttt{@sizeOf(T)}. \end{aligned}\]&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a slice in Zig is just a special case of a struct which contains one pointer (&lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt;) and a length (&lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt;). So,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example (using another builtin &lt;code&gt;@TypeOf&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pub fn main() void {
    memory_printout(@TypeOf(digits_array));
    memory_printout(@TypeOf(digits_slice));
}

const digits_array = [10]u8{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
const digits_slice: []const u8 = digits_array[0..]; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;Output:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;@alignOf( [10]u8 ): 1         @sizeOf( [10]u8 ): 10
@alignOf( []const u8 ): 8     @sizeOf( []const u8 ): 16
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;(Untagged) Unions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;An untagged, bare union in Zig (accomplished with the &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; keyword) essentially acts as a switch statement over a number of mutually-exclusive options of various types without the ability to report which option is active. To express a bare union type in memory, we just need enough memory to store the largest option(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, untagged unions in Zig without the &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; keyword seem to require extra memory, essentially one more alignment’s worth. So, untagged unions should satisfy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pub fn main() void {
    memory_printout(U_bare);
    memory_printout(U);
}

const U_bare = extern union {
    a: i64,
    b: extern struct { c: i64, d: i64, e: i64 },
};

const U = union {
    a: i64,
    b: struct { c: i64, d: i64, e: i64 },
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;Output:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;@alignOf( U_bare ): 8   @sizeOf( U_bare ): 24
@alignOf( U ): 8        @sizeOf( U ): 32
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tagged Unions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tagged unions are unions which use an additional enum to detect which field is active in the union. Alignment for a tagged union must additionally consider the alignment of the tag too, while the size must treat the tag and fields together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: there are no “bare” tagged unions. So, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;keyword doesn’t work on tagged unions.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose &lt;code&gt;U(E)&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;union(enum)&lt;/code&gt;. Then, we can compute the alignment and size of this type depending on those of its union and enum components:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pub fn main() void {
    memory_printout(UE);
    memory_printout(UF);
    memory_printout(UG);
}

const E = enum { a, b };
const F = enum(u64) { a, b };
const G = enum(u128) { a, b };

const UE = union(E) {
    a: i64, b: struct { c: i64, d: i64 }
};
const UF = union(F) {
    a: i64, b: struct { c: i64, d: i64 }
};
const UG = union(G) {
    a: i64, b: struct { c: i64, d: i64 }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;Output:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;@alignOf( UE ): 8       @sizeOf( UE ): 24
@alignOf( UF ): 8       @sizeOf( UF ): 24
@alignOf( UG ): 16      @sizeOf( UG ): 32
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ArrayLists and MultiArrayLists&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;code&gt;ArrayList(T)&lt;/code&gt; in Zig is the standard library’s dynamic array implementation. This is comparable to the notions of a “vector” in C++ or a “list” in Python, otherwise understood as the Array of Structs (AoS) memory layout. Elements of type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; are stored contiguously in memory each with their full size and padding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ArrayList(T)&lt;/code&gt; type itself is a struct containing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt;: a slice&lt;code&gt;[]T&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;capacity&lt;/code&gt;: a&lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the &lt;code&gt;ArrayList(T)&lt;/code&gt; type has a fixed memory footprint:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the data that the ArrayList manages lives on the heap. When iterating over an ArrayList, you traverse memory in strides of $\texttt{@sizeOf(T)}$ bytes. The memory consumed by the backing buffer is simply:&lt;/p&gt;\[\begin{aligned} \texttt{buffer_alignment} &amp;amp;= \texttt{@alignOf(T)},\\ \texttt{buffer_size} &amp;amp;= \texttt{buffer.capacity} \cdot \texttt{@sizeOf(T)}. \end{aligned}\]&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a &lt;code&gt;MultiArrayList(T)&lt;/code&gt; in Zig follows the Struct of Arrays (SoA) memory layout. Instead of storing complete &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; instances contiguously, it stores each field of &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; in its own separate, tightly-packed array.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;MultiArrayList(T)&lt;/code&gt; type itself is a struct containing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt;: a single pointer to the backing buffer,&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt;: a&lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;capacity&lt;/code&gt;: a&lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;So:&lt;/p&gt;\[\begin{aligned} \texttt{@alignOf(MultiArrayList(T))} &amp;amp;= \texttt{@alignOf(usize)} = 8 \text{ bytes (on 64-bit)},\\ \texttt{@sizeOf(MultiArrayList(T))} &amp;amp;= 3 \cdot \texttt{@sizeOf(usize)} = 24 \text{ bytes (on 64-bit)}. \end{aligned}\]&lt;p&gt;The backing buffer stores all field arrays contiguously. Padding between fields is not needed; instead, each field array is packed according to the field’s alignment. Summing over the fields of $T$, the total buffer size would thus be:&lt;/p&gt;\[\texttt{buffer_size} = \texttt{buffer.capacity} \cdot \sum_{\texttt{fields}} \texttt{@sizeOf}(\texttt{field}).\]&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
const ArrayList = std.ArrayList;
const MultiArrayList = std.MultiArrayList;

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    const T = struct { a: u8, b: u16 };

    var list: ArrayList(T) = .{};
    defer list.deinit(allocator);

    var multiList: MultiArrayList(T) = .{};
    defer multiList.deinit(allocator);

    for (0..10_000) |_| {
        try list.append(allocator, .{ .a = 0, .b = 1 });
        try multiList.append(allocator, .{ .a = 0, .b = 1 });
    }

    memory_printout(T);
    memory_printout(ArrayList(T));
    memory_printout(MultiArrayList(T));
    std.debug.print("list capacity: {d}\n", .{list.capacity});
    std.debug.print("list buffer size: {d}\n", .{list.capacity * @sizeOf(T)});
    std.debug.print("multiList capacity: {d}\n", .{multiList.capacity});
    std.debug.print("multiList buffer size: {d}\n", .{multiList.capacity * (@sizeOf(@FieldType(T, "a")) + @sizeOf(@FieldType(T, "b")))});
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;Output:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;@alignOf( T ): 2                  @sizeOf( T ): 4
@alignOf( ArrayList(T) ): 8       @sizeOf( ArrayList(T) ): 24
@alignOf( MultiArrayList(T) ): 8  @sizeOf( MultiArrayList(T) ): 24
list capacity: 12854
list buffer size: 51416
multiList capacity: 11150
multiList buffer size: 33450
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Battle Testing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s test our formulas against the video that inspired this post: Andrew Kelley’s talk on DoD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: In order to get these examples to actually compile and execute in Zig (0.16.0), I had to throw in some allocators and extra helper methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ArrayList of Monsters (19:05)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;const Monster = struct {
  anim: *Animation, 
  kind: Kind,

  const Kind = enum { snake, bat, wolf, dingo, human };
};

var monsters: ArrayList(Monster) = .{};
var i: usize = 0;
while (i &amp;lt; 10_000) : (i += 1) {
  try monsters.append(.{
    .anim = getAnimation(),
    .kind = rng.enumValue(Monster.Kind),
  });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;Actual Memory Use:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;Monster size: 16 bytes 
ArrayList(Monster) size: 24 bytes
monsters size: 160_000 bytes        // Total memory size of 10_000 monsters
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do our formulas agree?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Monster&lt;/code&gt;Struct:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The fields of &lt;code&gt;Monster&lt;/code&gt;satisfy $\texttt{@alignOf(anim)} = 8$ and $\texttt{@alignOf(kind)} = 1$. So, we expect the alignment of the struct to be $\texttt{@alignOf(Monster)} = 8$.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;No matter the ordering, it takes two memory chunks of size 8 bytes to fit these fields (since $\texttt{@sizeOf(anim)} = 8$ and $\texttt{@sizeOf(kind)} = 1$). So, we expect $\texttt{@sizeOf(Monster)} = 16$, exactly as we observed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The fields of &lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ArrayList(Monster) Type: as a type, it takes a bit of overhead to specify &lt;code&gt;ArrayList(Monster)&lt;/code&gt;, since an ArrayList is really a slice&lt;code&gt;[]Monster&lt;/code&gt;plus a capacity (&lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt;). On my 64-bit machine, that adds up to 24 bytes of memory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;monsters&lt;/code&gt;ArrayList: remember, ArrayLists act like “arrays of structs”.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The natural size and alignment of the &lt;code&gt;Monster&lt;/code&gt;struct dictate the layout of the&lt;code&gt;monsters&lt;/code&gt;ArrayList.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The size of an ArrayList in memory should equal its length times the size of each &lt;code&gt;Monster&lt;/code&gt;element type. So, we expect&lt;code&gt;monsters&lt;/code&gt;to take up $10,000 \times \texttt{@sizeOf(Monster)} = 160,000$ bytes, as observed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The natural size and alignment of the &lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Footnotes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zig is a modern, C-like programming language which offers a safer, more memory-explicit experience for systems programming, without sacrificing low-level control or C interoperability. Notably, Zig makes it straightforward to manage memory allocation by treating allocators as first-class values rather than hidden globals. Instead of relying on an implicit runtime or a process-wide allocator, you pass explicit allocator objects into the code that needs them. This makes ownership and lifetimes much clearer, encourages you to design APIs around who is responsible for allocating and freeing memory, and makes it easy to swap in custom allocation strategies (e.g., arenas, scratch, tracking, etc.). ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recall: $\displaystyle \texttt{bytes}(\texttt{bits}) := \max(1, 2^{\lceil\log_2(\frac{\texttt{bits}}{8})\rceil})$ whenever $\texttt{bits} &amp;gt; 0$. Otherwise, $\texttt{bytes}(0) = 0$. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Almost all transactional emails are being marked as suspicious even when their SPF/DKIM records are fine and they’ve been whitelisted before. Did Google break something in gmail/spam filtering?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Briefly, this morning, I had the opposite effect happen to my Gmail inbox in which things that would normally land in the social and updates folders ended up in my primary folder. I don't know which I'd be more freaked out by: a broken Gmail spam filter or 18 inches of snow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a great reminder of how good this feature is that we take for granted. I think this outage has actually improved my appreciation for Gmail (a service I normally only complain about).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seriously. I didn't even realize this was a wide issue, but I couldn't find a school enrolment email I was looking for this morning, and found it in the spam folder. The fact that I basically never have to do this is actually amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been “down” for me for a few months now, ever since Google tied this functionality to the same toggle that opts you in for using your email data for AI training. So now you can’t filter this stuff without also agreeing to a whole swath of unrelated and opt-ins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ive since gone on an unsubscribe campaign, and things seem bearable now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same here. Until recently I would get maybe 1-2 spams a month, and I just got 30 in the span of a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re the very obvious, very obnoxious kind of spam, and Gmail still correctly sends them to the junk bin, so I wonder if they were shadowbanned before and Google simply decided to make the process more explicit (which I don’t hate on principle).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either that or my address was scrapped from somewhere by a spam bot and the timing is coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, my Gmail inbox is full of regular senders being flagged as "possibly unsafe" and I need to click a button "Looks Safe" to accept them. They are not being spamboxed, but they are definitely flagged. Even official communications from the USPS!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason given is that "Gmail hasn't scanned this message", so I suppose the scanners are unavailable/disabled for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They should also be tagged as "Important" but they are not. I believe this is a heuristic-based designation, and it has not been working too great lately. My most important mail is coming through as "unimportant".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are not being marked as "Suspicious" but they are showing an infobox that explains they could not be scanned at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could click "Seems Safe" on these messages, but they are not scanned by Google, and they are simply adding a disclaimer that they currently can't vouch for the safety of a message that they couldn't scan. It seems to me that this is a prudent and helpful course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't understand why spam detection is so complicated. I can tell with high accuracy if an email is spam just by the subject line. I'd think even basic ML could do this very reliably you don't need a bleeding-edge LLM to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phishing is tricker because it can be very deceptive especially if you're being targeted specifically. But also usually pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Are you available? * Paul, can we have a zoom meeting with you on Monday? * Assistance for donation * Greetings!!! * some ideas for you * Refund request * Somethings not working * Manuel Montoya for roof work contractor * proposals for print * Invite Connection&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Half of the above are actual spam, half are not. Tell me which is which ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This only applies to spam which requires significant follow-up effort from the spammer to respond to potential victims; effectively just 419 "advance-fee" fraud scams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For spam which only does not require manual effort on the other side, there is no reason to filter out potential victims and all the more reason to make it look as legit as possible to maximize conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been receiving a large number of spam emails in my "Important and Unread" areas which is anomalous. I was wondering exactly why and this helps. thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have an absurd and overwrought system involving Gmail, and client-side rspamd and SpamSieve on my Mac. Gmail is (was?) overly aggressive flagging things as spam, so I have the client-side Bayesian filter check Gmail’s spam folder and rescue good email, so long as rspamd also says it’s not phishing. And then add sender to a Gmail whitelisting rule. All rescued email is flagged such that if I later manually move any of it back to junk, it stays there as spam and updates the corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I now never get good email in the spam folder, and never get undetected spam in the inbox, and very occasionally get a spam erroneously rescued, but still visually flagged as iffy-but-maybe-ham.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Gmail has been lax at filtering spam lately, I haven’t noticed, but perhaps the Bayesian filter has been picking up the slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple accounts as others have said. The most powerful is to switch to a provider that permits custom domains and allows you to construct topic specific wildcard addresses on the fly. These can't be flagged as invalid or stripped like Google '+' suffixes and when compromised, you can filter them into oblivion and move on to something else. You also get the bonus of having the entire namespace to yourself and can select short addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step zero. Never disclose your email address to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very easy and straightforward. I operate 6 Gmail accounts, and three are "alts" where I've basically never given the address out to anyone at all, and they receive zero spam, zero UCE, zero marketing emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, on my "main" I've disclosed the address to many entities and I use it for sign-in and shipping and many things. And yes, I do receive spam and scam emails there, but wcyd?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently had a "role" Google account terminated because I was (paraphrasing) "violating Google policies" by having multiple accounts. I didn't know they were sticklers about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I don't much care because the account was just used for interacting with somebody else's Google-hosted junk but, if I had been using it for something serious, I have probably been frustrated.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no way, no possible way that Google prohibits the use of multiple accounts. They do not. They cannot. I just asked Gemini and I checked the actual TOS. It does not, in any way, prohibit these uses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, this is plainly evident by the way they give you tools to operate them in a systematic way. You can add multiple accounts to a single Android "user". You can add them to a single Google Chromebook account under one signed-in account. You can add multiple accounts separately to the same Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add multiple accounts with the same names, the same birthdates, and the same Driver License. I've validated at least two YouTube channels by showing exactly the same ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google did not terminate your account for the reason you state. You are not telling us all the background information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google may indeed terminate multiple accounts for the same person because of TOS violations. They will definitely link and associate your accounts, so making an "alt account" for misbehavior is not safe. If my "alt account" is compromised or violates TOS, then I can expect they will discipline all 6 equally, because they're all linked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But operating multiple accounts is very explicitly supported by Google, and by Microsoft as well, I will say. I don't know about Apple. Facebook definitely prohibited this in the past, although you can maintain multiple "profiles" and "pages" that have unique settings and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, spam is no big deal, and any scam that comes via email should not affect anyone who is educated and prepared for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, with a well-known email address, you could run a higher risk of credential stuffing, and an account takeover by someone who hijacks your email account, and then pivots from there to taking other accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this seems to be a risk we all take: email addresses are meant to be shared, to be public, and to be well-known to anyone to correspond with us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will say that disclosing my email address to certain parties has had noticeable effects. For example, I used "MYADDRESS+Echovita@gmail.com" once, and only once. My godfather had passed away, and I ordered some flowers for his funeral. And I put that order through with that email address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, Echovita themselves had a data breach shortly afterwards, and I was inundated with scam emails. Just all sorts of attackers and they were basically all using the same M.O. But they were readily identifiable because I had used that "+Echovita" to identify it uniquely. And they really haven't stopped coming in. It's been 5 years since that breach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes, especially with untrusted parties, it may help to tag your email address. I don't worry about receiving spam anywhere. But like I said, since I've never ever disclosed the addresses of 2-3 of my "alt accounts" they simply never receive any mail at all, spam or no spam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like an easier solution to having six different email addresses is to use Gmail aliases - I've caught a few less-than-honest companies either selling my email address, or been breached without disclosing such, simply by using an alias along the lines of '+service_name'. If any alias starts to receive spam you can setup rules to automatically delete everything that comes in with that. You also get the added benefit of significantly easier and more accurate search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think y'all understand why I have separate Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use them for different purposes. They are "role accounts" for projects I am doing, such as geneaology and astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to use YouTube sanely, and store different stuff in Drive, I separate them into unique accounts. I use those accounts for specific things, and my YouTube subscriptions, playlists, etc. are tailored for each role, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not about email at all. Obviously, I can access all those email accounts through the one app on my smartphone or the one PWA on my Chromebook. They are easily manageable but separate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also run 3 Outlook/Microsoft accounts, and for the same reason. (One of them is my academic account from community college, and the other two are personal.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't need to give out email addresses for the "role accounts" except where I "Sign In With Google" to various services. So I don't really send/receive email from them at all, except where I'm sharing links or documents with myself (the best way to do this cross-account is still by using email, oftentimes.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Gmail since the beta (I got invite from a googler) and I don't remember when they began adding spam control but in my experience the GMail spam check works usually exceptionally well: I very rarely need to add a custom filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My email, over two decades+ (2004?), hasn't been in a many public leaks (only one on https://haveibeenpwned.com/ ) but obviously has made its way to various spammy actors but thankfully nearly everything is caught by GMail's spam filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anything I'd say GMail's spam filter works too well: I get more legit emails in my spam folder than spam in my regular inbox. As in: one in a rare while vs about zero spam in my regular inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been happening for about a month for me. I had to start monitoring spam because legit emails end up there. Funnily enough I started having the opposite problem too - plenty of obvious spam and phishing attempt ending up in my mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have seen a spam button show up I haven't seen in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be a new round of AI training featuring the labour of customers as free employees doing training. Every time we click, we consent to sharing private email data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's your confirmation, then. It must be either a localized failure to some subgroup of users, or triggered by some combination of settings, if some people are seeing it and others are not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its really slow. Too slow to use 2FA or in some cases, verify email addresses or recover passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people can't handle a notification on their watch every minute, or several spam every five minutes, so "large numbers of people" are shutting off notifications on their phones. And human nature being what it is, they're not going to be turned back on again. So the era of getting a notification when you get an email is coming to a close. "Important Immediate Attention Stuff" moved to text messages a long time ago anyway, at least for me. The list of technologies you can no longer reach me on, always increases over time...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Metriport is an open-source data intelligence platform that helps healthcare organizations access and exchange patient data in real-time. We integrate with all major US healthcare IT systems and tap into comprehensive medical data for 300+ million individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We've found product-market fit with multi-million ARR, 100+ customers (including Strive Health, Circle Medical, and Brightside Health), backing from top VCs, and years of runway. We're ready to scale. We're a tight-knit, high-performing team of mostly former founders (including two YC alumni). We're engineering-heavy, operate with minimal bureaucracy and high autonomy, and hire based on competence, not prestige. We push hard—founders work six days a week from our SF office—but give everyone freedom to craft their schedule. We measure output and we're committed to sustainable intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About us&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The following points are an assortment of the most relevant bits that will give you the gist of where we’re at, why we’ll win, and our company culture:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Well funded with a massive recent infusion of capital, found PMF, multi-million ARR, 80+ customers (including Strive Health, Circle Medical, and Brightside Health), funded by top VCs and angels, have years of runway - and we’re just getting started.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We’re a tight-knit, high performing, and passionate team - we work with a consistent intensity and have become a leader in our industry with a fraction of the resources of our competitors.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Consistency means we push as hard as humanly possible, while keeping our health and personal lives in check.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Meaningful work is what gets us out of bed, and we just wouldn’t be satisfied by building yet another CRM company.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;By pedigree, we’re a group of underdogs - we don’t hire based on prestige, but on demonstrated competence and perceived potential.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We’re engineering heavy, and most of our engineers are former founders (including 2 ex-YC founders).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We operate as a relatively flat structure with little red tape, forced structure, or bureaucracy. We just opt to get shit done and foster a collaborative environment with high autonomy - our GitHub commit history and product velocity is a testament to this.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;The founders set the pace by working 6 days a week in our SF office, but everyone is given full freedom to craft a schedule that’s best for both the team and themselves - team output is measured.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; About you&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, we're looking for a security engineer with the following specific qualities:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You’re entrepreneurial-minded, with an olympian-level work ethic (nearly our entire engineering team consists of former founders).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You are passionate about security and are excited to own security related projects within the company end-to-end.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You are confident in your ability to build scalable systems across the full stack, and people usually come to you for technical guidance.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You believe you can solve any problem that comes at you, and don't shy away from diving deep into areas where you may lack domain expertise.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You have a strong sense of ownership over your work, and have demonstrated ability to lead others.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You know how to move fast - while still maintaining a strong security posture.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You care more about the end result and delivering value, rather than what new and frilly tech is being used under the hood for a given feature.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;When someone scopes out a project with an ETA of 3 weeks, you ask yourself "why can't it be done in 3 days?".&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You’re a hacker at heart, and have a good sense of what rules should, and shouldn’t, be broken.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you'll be doing&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After quickly ramping up using our comprehensive onboarding materials to get familiar with our domain, product, and codebase, the goal would be to get you shipping product directly to customers as quickly as possible. Specifically, day to day, this looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Evangelizing security across Metriport’s growing team - we will look to you for guidance, and training.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Driving full-stack security projects , big and small, end-to-end from ideation to production rollout.These projects could include things like: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Implement an enterprise-grade audit logging solution for a new national healthcare network infrastructure stack.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Implement fine grained RBAC on the API key access layer, and more robust roles on our UIs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Help us revamp our internal security policies and put tools in place to keep the platform, and employees, secure while still allowing the team to be efficient.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Helping the engineering team with PR reviews with a security-focused lens.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Work with the Go to Market team to complete customer security assessments and questionnaires.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Work with the engineering team to harden security across the development lifecycle - think secret management, access controls, and vulnerability scanning.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Managing your own work in Linear.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Participating in bi-weekly sprint planning / retro sessions, and quarterly planning sessions.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Attending a daily 30 minute remote stand-up at 7:30am PST Mon-Fri (our only regular mandatory meeting).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Our tech&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On the frontend, we use React - on the backend, we rely on Node.js and TypeScript for writing core business logic. We deploy a wide range of AWS cloud services (ie ECS, Fargate, Lambda, etc), and manage our infrastructure as code with AWS CDK. Data lives in PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, S3, Snowflake, FHIR servers, and more. We use Oneleet for security and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Metriport provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo 0.0.4 and our December nightly builds now support multiple windows (@mrobinson, @mukilan, #40927, #41235, #41144)! This builds on features that landed in Servo’s embedding API last month. We’ve also landed support for several web platform features, both old and new:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;‘contrast-color()’ in CSS color values (@webbeef, #41542)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;partial support for &amp;lt;meta charset&amp;gt; (@simonwuelker, #41376)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;partial support for encoding sniffing (@simonwuelker, #41435)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;‘background’ and ‘bgcolor’ attributes on &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;tfoot&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;th&amp;gt; (@simonwuelker, #41272)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;tee() on readable byte streams (@Taym95, #35991)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For better compatibility with older web content, we now support vendor-prefixed CSS properties like ‘-moz-transform’ (@mrobinson, #41350), as well as window.clientInformation (@Taym95, #41111).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve continued shipping the SubtleCrypto API, with full support for ChaCha20-Poly1305, RSA-OAEP, RSA-PSS, and RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (see below), plus importKey() for ML-KEM (@kkoyung, #41585) and several other improvements (@kkoyung, @PaulTreitel, @danilopedraza, #41180, #41395, #41428, #41442, #41472, #41544, #41563, #41587, #41039, #41292):&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Algorithm&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;(@kkoyung, #40978, #41003, #41030)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using servoshell on Windows, you can now see &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; and log output, as long as servoshell was started in a console (@jschwe, #40961).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo diagnostics options are now accessible in servoshell via the &lt;code&gt;SERVO_DIAGNOSTICS&lt;/code&gt; environment variable (@atbrakhi, #41013), in addition to the usual &lt;code&gt;-Z&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;--debug=&lt;/code&gt; arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo’s devtools now partially support the Network &amp;gt; Security tab (@jiang1997, #40567), allowing you to inspect some of the TLS details of your requests. We’ve also made it compatible with Firefox 145 (@eerii, #41087), and use fewer IPC resources (@mrobinson, #41161).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve fixed rendering bugs related to ‘float’, ‘order’, ‘max-width’, ‘max-height’, ‘:link’ selectors, &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; layout, and getClientRects(), affecting intrinsic sizing (@Loirooriol, #41513), anonymous blocks (@Loirooriol, #41510), incremental layout (@Loirooriol, #40994), flex item sizing (@Loirooriol, #41291), selector matching (@andreubotella, #41478), replaced element layout (@Loirooriol, #41262), and empty fragments (@Loirooriol, #41477).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo now fires ‘toggle’ events on &amp;lt;dialog&amp;gt; (@lukewarlow, #40412). We’ve also improved the conformance of ‘wheel’ events (@mrobinson, #41182), ‘hashchange’ events (@Taym95, #41325), ‘dblclick’ events on &amp;lt;input&amp;gt; (@Taym95, #41319), ‘resize’ events on &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; (@tharkum, #40940), ‘seeked’ events on &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; (@tharkum, #40981), and the ‘transform’ property in getComputedStyle() (@mrobinson, #41187).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Embedding API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo now has basic support for HTTP proxies (@Narfinger, #40941). You can set the proxy URL in the &lt;code&gt;http_proxy&lt;/code&gt; (@Narfinger, #41209) or &lt;code&gt;HTTP_PROXY&lt;/code&gt; (@treeshateorcs, @yezhizhen, #41268) environment variables, or via &lt;code&gt;--pref network_http_proxy_uri&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now use the system root certificates by default (@Narfinger, @mrobinson, #40935, #41179), on most platforms. If you don’t want to trust the system root certificates, you can instead continue to use Mozilla’s root certificates with &lt;code&gt;--pref network_use_webpki_roots&lt;/code&gt;.
As always, you can also add your own root certificates via &lt;code&gt;Opts&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;certificate_path&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;--certificate-path=&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a new &lt;code&gt;SiteDataManager&lt;/code&gt; API for managing localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies (@janvarga, #41236, #41255, #41378, #41523, #41528), and a new &lt;code&gt;NetworkManager&lt;/code&gt; API for managing the cache (@janvarga, @mrobinson, #41255, #41474, #41386).
To clear the cache, call &lt;code&gt;NetworkManager&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;clear_cache&lt;/code&gt;, and to list cache entries, call &lt;code&gt;NetworkManager&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;cache_entries&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple dialogs – that is alert(), confirm(), and prompt() – are now exposed to embedders via a new &lt;code&gt;SimpleDialog&lt;/code&gt; type in &lt;code&gt;EmbedderControl&lt;/code&gt; (@mrobinson, @mukilan, #40982).
This new interface is harder to misuse, and no longer requires boilerplate for embedders that wish to ignore simple dialogs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web console messages, including messages from the Console API, are now accessible via &lt;code&gt;ServoDelegate&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;show_console_message&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WebViewDelegate&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;show_console_message&lt;/code&gt; (@atbrakhi, #41351).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Servo&lt;/code&gt;, the main handle for controlling Servo, is now cloneable for sharing within the same thread (@mukilan, @mrobinson, #41010).
To shut down Servo, simply drop the last &lt;code&gt;Servo&lt;/code&gt; handle or let it go out of scope.
&lt;code&gt;Servo&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;start_shutting_down&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Servo&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;deinit&lt;/code&gt; have been removed (@mukilan, @mrobinson, #41012).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several interfaces have also been renamed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Servo&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;clear_cookies&lt;/code&gt;is now&lt;code&gt;SiteDataManager&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;clear_cookies&lt;/code&gt;(@janvarga, #41236, #41255)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;DebugOpts&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;disable_share_style_cache&lt;/code&gt;is now&lt;code&gt;Preferences&lt;/code&gt;::&lt;code&gt;layout_style_sharing_cache_enabled&lt;/code&gt;(@atbrakhi, #40959)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The rest of &lt;code&gt;DebugOpts&lt;/code&gt;has been moved to&lt;code&gt;DiagnosticsLogging&lt;/code&gt;, and the options have been renamed (@atbrakhi, #40960)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Perf and stability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can now evict entries from our HTTP cache (@Narfinger, @gterzian, @Taym95, #40613), rather than having it grow forever (or get cleared by an embedder). about:memory now tracks SVG-related memory usage (@d-kraus, #41481), and we’ve fixed memory leaks in &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; (@tharkum, #41131).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo now does less work when matching selectors (@webbeef, #41368), when focus changes (@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #40984), and when reflowing boxes whose size did not change (@Loirooriol, @mrobinson, #41160).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To allow for smaller binaries, gamepad support is now optional at build time (@WaterWhisperer, #41451).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve fixed some undefined behaviour around garbage collection (@sagudev, @jdm, @gmorenz, #41546, mozjs#688, mozjs#689, mozjs#692). To better avoid other garbage-collection-related bugs (@sagudev, mozjs#647, mozjs#638), we’ve continued our work on defining (and migrating to) safer interfaces between Servo and the SpiderMonkey GC (@sagudev, #41519, #41536, #41537, #41520, #41564).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve fixed a crash that occurs when &amp;lt;link rel=“shortcut icon”&amp;gt; has an empty ‘href’ attribute, which affected chiptune.com (@webbeef, #41056), and we’ve also fixed crashes in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;‘background-repeat’ (@mrobinson, #41158)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; layout (@Loirooriol, #41262)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;custom elements (@mrobinson, #40743)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AudioBuffer (@WaterWhisperer, #41253)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AudioNode (@Taym95, #40954)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ReportingObserver (@Taym95, #41261)&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;the fonts system, on FreeType platforms (@simonwuelker, #40945)&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re going to be taking a look at what almost 13 years of development has done for the Raspberry Pi. I have one of each generation of Pi from the original Pi that was launched in 2012 through to the Pi 5 which was released just over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll take a look at what has changed between each generation and how their performance and power consumption has improved by running some tests on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s my video of the testing process and results, read on for the write-up;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hardware Changes Through Each Generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the original Raspberry Pi, which was launched in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Pi has a Broadcom BCM2835 SOC which features a single ARM1176JZF-S core running at 700MHz along with a VideoCore IV GPU. It has 512 MB of DDR RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of connectivity, it only has 100Mb networking and 2 x USB 2.0 ports. Video output is 1080P through a full-size HDMI port or analogue video out through a composite video connector and audio output is provided through a 3.5mm audio jack. It doesn’t have any WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity but it does have some of the features that we still have on more recent models like DSI and CSI ports, a full size SD card reader for the operating system and GPIO pins, although only 26 of them at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Power is supplied through a micro USB port and it is rated for 5V and 700mA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was priced at $35 – which at the time was incredibly cheap for what was essentially a palm-sized computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 2 was launched 3 years later, in February 2015 and this Pi looked quite different to the original and similar to the Pi’s we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 2 has a significantly better processor than the original. The Broadcom BCM2836 SOC has 4 Cortex-A7 cores running at 900 MHz and it retained the same VideoCore IV GPU. RAM was also bumped up to 1GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It added another 2 x USB 2.0 ports alongside the 100Mb Ethernet port. The composite video port disappeared and the analogue video output was moved into the audio jack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GPIO pins were increased to 40 pins which has followed the same pin layout since – which has really helped in maintaining compatibility with hats and accessories. The SD card reader was also changed to a microSD card reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuitry was bumped up to 800mA to accommodate the more powerful CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 3&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 3 was launched just a year later, in February 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 3’s new Broadcom BCM2837 SOC retained the same 4-core architecture but these were changed to 64-bit Cortex A53 cores running at 1.2Ghz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RAM was kept at 1GB but was now DDR2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was no change to the USB or Ethernet connectivity on the original Pi 3 but we did see WiFi and Bluetooth added for the first time. WiFi was single band 2.4GHz and we had Bluetooth 4.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The version that I have is actually the 3B+, which was launched a little later. The main improvements over the original Pi 3 were a 0.2GHz boost to the clock speed and the upgrade to Gigabit networking with PoE (Power over Ethernet) support and dual-band WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuitry was again improved, still running at 5V but now up to 1.34A, which was almost double the Pi 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next came the Pi 4 in June 2019. This Pi came at one of the worst times for global manufacturing and was notoriously difficult to get hold of due to the impact of COVID on the global supply chain. Quite ironically, this hard-to-get Pi is the one that I’ve got the most of, mainly due to my water-cooled Pi cluster build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 4 has a Broadcom BCM2711 SOC with 4 Cortex-A72 cores running at 1.5GHz. So again a slight clock speed increase over the Pi 3 but still retaining 4 cores. It also includes a bump up to a VideoCore VI GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the first model to feature different RAM configurations. It was originally available in 1, 2, 4GB variants featuring LPDDR4 RAM and in March of 2020 an 8GB variant was added to the linup as well. This obviously resulted in a few different price points but impressively they still managed to keep a $35 offering 7 years after the launch of the first Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It retained the same form factor as the Pi 3 but with the network and Ethernet ports switched around. Notably, two of the USB ports were upgraded to USB 3.0, networking was now gigabit ethernet like the 3B+, WiFi was dual-band and it had Bluetooth 5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also changed the single full-size HDMI port to two micro HDMI ports. Most people I know don’t like this change and find it annoying to have to use adaptors to work with common displays and these micro HDMI ports are prone to breaking when they are used often. I think general hobbyists and makers would prefer this to still be a single full-size port but Pi’s are often used in commercial display applications so I guess that’s why they went with this dual micro HDMI configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuit was actually reduced in this model, from 1.34 down to 1.25A and the port was changed to USB C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly and most recently we have the Pi 5 which was launched in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Pi features a Broadcom BCM2712 SOC with 4 Cortex A76 cores running at a significantly faster 2.4Ghz and a VideoCore VII GPU running at 800MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So quite a bump up in CPU and GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is offered in 3 RAM configurations but the drop in a 1GB offering means that they’re no longer available at the $35 price point. There is a fairly significant increase in price up to $50 for the base 2GB variant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some other notable changes are the inclusion of a PCIe port which enables IO expansion and a much improved power circuit. The PCIe port is quite commonly used to add an NVMe SSD instead of a microSD card for the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuit was upgraded to handle the PCIe port addition, now stepping up to 5V at up to 5A, along with a power button for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change in power supply requirements to 5V and 5A is a bit annoying as most power delivery capable supplies cap out 2.5 or 3A at 5V. It would have been more universal to require a 9V 3A supply to meet the Pis power requirements. I assume they steered away from this because the Pi’s circuitry runs at 5V and 3.3V and they would have then needed to add another onboard DC-DC converter which increases complexity, size and potentially the cost, it would also have made it a bit less efficient. But this does mean that you most likely need to buy a USB C power supply that has been purpose-built for the Pi 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 5 is also the first Pi to have its own dedicated fan socket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that’s a summary of the hardware changes, now let’s boot them up and take a look at their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing The Performance Of Each Generation Of Pi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compare the performance between the Pi’s, I’m going to run the following tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I’m going to attempt to playback a 1080P YouTube video in the browser, although I expect we’ll have problems with this up to the Pi 4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ll then run a Sysbench CPU benchmark which I’ll do both for a single-core and multicore.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then we’ll run a GLMark2 GPU benchmark.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then test the storage speed using James Chambers Pi Benchmark script.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then we’ll run an iPerf3 Network Speed test.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lastly, we’ll look at Power Consumption, both at idle and with the CPU maxed out.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And then use that data to determine each Pi’s Performance per Watt.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep things as consistent as possible I’m going to be running the latest available version of Pi OS from Raspberry Pi Imager for each Pi. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can still flash an OS image for the original Pi in their latest version of Imager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll be testing them all running on a 32GB Sandisk Ultra microSD card. I’ll also be using an Ice Tower cooler on each to ensure they don’t run anywhere near thermal throttling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1080P YouTube Video Playback&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started with the original Pi and its first boot and setup process was a lesson in patience. It took me the best part of two hours to get the first boot complete, the Pi updated and the testing utilities installed but I got there in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even once set up it takes about 8 minutes to boot up to the desktop and the CPU stays pegged at 100% for another two to three minutes before dropping down to about 20% at idle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Pi refused to open up the browser, so that’s where my YouTube video playback test ended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 2 managed to open the browser and actually started playing back a 1080P video, which was surprising, but playback was terrible. It dropped pretty much all of the frames both in the window and fullscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 3 played video back noticeably better than the Pi 2, but it’s still quite a long way away from being usable and still drops a lot of frames.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 4 handled 1080P video reasonably well. It had some initial trouble but then settled down. Fullscreen is also a bit choppy but is also usable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 5 handled 1080P playback well without any significant issues both in the window and fullscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sysbench CPU Benchmark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next was the Sysbench CPU benchmark. I ran three tests on each and averaged the scores and I did this for both single-core and multicore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In single core, the Pi 1 managed a rather dismal score of 68, the Pi 2 got a bit more than double this score but the real step up was with the Pi 3 which managed 18 times higher than the Pi 2. The Pi 4 and Pi 5 also offered good improvements on the previous generations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly in multicore, the Pi 3 scored over 18 times the score of the Pi2 and the Pi 4 and 5 provided good improvements on the Pi 3’s score.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the combined multicore score of the Pi 5 to what the single core on the Pi 1 can do, the Pi 5 is a little over 600 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GLmark2 GPU Benchmark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I tried running a GLMark2 GPU benchmark on them. I used the GLMark2-es2-wayland version which is designed for OpenGL ES so that the Pi 1 was supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was surprised that the Pi 1 was even able to run GLMark2 – it did complete the benchmark, although the score wasn’t all that impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results really show how the Pi’s GPU has improved in the last two generations. Prior to these tests, I had never seen a score below 100 and the Pi 1, 2 and 3 managed to fall short of triple digits. Pi 5 scored over 2.5 times higher than the Pi 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Storage Speed Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next was the storage speed test using James Chambers Pi Benchmarks script. The bus speed has increased over the years from 25MHz on the Pi 1 to 100MHz on the Pi 5, so I expect we’ll see these reflected in the benchmark scores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The storage speed test’s results aren’t as dramatic as the CPU and GPU results but show a steady improvement between generations. The Pi 3 did a bit worse than the Pi 2 but this small difference is likely just due to variability in the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;iPerf Network Speed Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I ran the iPerf network speed test on each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 1 doesn’t quite get close to its theoretical 100Mbps but the Pi 2 does. The Pi 3 B+ although having Gigabit Ethernet is limited by this running over USB 2.0 which only has a theoretical maximum of 300MBps, so it came quite close. Both the Pi 4 and 5 expectedly come close to theoretical Gigabit speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Power Consumption Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I tested the power consumption of each Pi at idle and under load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used the same Pi 5 power adaptor to test all of the Pis to keep things consistent and I just used a USB C to micro USB adaptor for the Pi 1, 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idle results were closer than I expected. The Pi 2 had the lowest idle power draw and the Pi 5 the highest, but all were within a watt or two of each other. At full load, you can see the increase in CPU power draw more physical power with the Pi 5 drawing almost three times the Pi 1 and Pi 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Converted to performance per watt using the Sysbench results, we can again see how much better the Pi 4 and 5 are over the Pi 1 and 2. There is a clear improvement in the performance that each generation of Pi is able to get per watt of power, which is essentially its efficiency. Although the Pi 5 draws more power than the Pi 1 under full load, you’re getting almost 200 times more power out of it per watt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts On The Drag Race And Future Pis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed working through this project to see how much Pi’s have changed over the years, particularly in terms of performance. I still remember being amazed at the size and price of the original Pi when it came out and it’s great that they’re still fully supported and can still be used for projects – albeit with less CPU-intensive projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think has been the biggest improvement to the Pi over the years and what you’d still like to see added to future models in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I personally really like the addition of the PCIe port on the Pi 5 and I’d like to see 2.5Gb networking and a DisplayPort or USB C with DisplayPort added to a future generation of Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Hung by a Thread&lt;/head&gt;January 24, 2026&lt;p&gt;It's 2am. My robot is frozen. Not crashed, not erroring, just... vibing. Sitting there. Motors off. Completely checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been debugging for 8 hours and I'm about to mass delete my entire codebase and become a farmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Setup&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm building autonomous sidewalk robots. The control loop runs at 100Hz — every 10ms we read sensors, do math, send motor commands. It's the heartbeat. The one thing that absolutely cannot stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been rock solid for weeks. Then I added LiDAR streaming over WebRTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, ~16 seconds after a client connects, the loop just stops. Doesn't crash. Doesn't throw. Just ghosts me. The watchdog starts barking, the robot coasts to a stop, and my laptop shows a beautiful 3D point cloud of a robot that has given up on life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Wrong Turns&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's tokio starving the loop" — switched to &lt;code&gt;std::thread::sleep&lt;/code&gt;. Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the async mutex" — swapped for &lt;code&gt;std::sync::Mutex&lt;/code&gt;. Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's running on the wrong thread" — moved the whole loop to &lt;code&gt;std::thread::spawn&lt;/code&gt;. Complete isolation. Nope nope nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same freeze. Same spot. Iteration 1,615. Every single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consistency was almost insulting. Like the bug was laughing at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Breakthrough&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok new plan. I add a heartbeat thread. Just a lil guy that watches a counter and screams if it stops:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::thread::spawn(move || {
    let mut last = 0;
    loop {
        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5));
        let current = counter.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
        if current == last {
            eprintln!("STUCK at iteration {}", current);
        }
        last = current;
    }
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five seconds after freeze: &lt;code&gt;STUCK at iteration 1615&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh. OH. It's not slow. It's not starved. It's blocked. Something is holding a lock and simply not letting go. Deadlock behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to bring out the big guns. GDB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's waiting on a mutex. But who's holding it??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I scroll through the other threads. Tokio workers, GStreamer stuff, and then... four threads I definitely did not create. Rayon workers. I don't use rayon. Who invited rayon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Reveal&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rerun is this beautiful visualization SDK I use for recording telemetry. You call &lt;code&gt;recorder.log()&lt;/code&gt; and magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out rerun uses rayon internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I was calling &lt;code&gt;recorder.log()&lt;/code&gt; while holding a mutex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a known rayon footgun: rayon#592. When you call into rayon while holding a mutex, rayon's work-stealing threads can deadlock trying to "help" with work that needs the lock you're already holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's it. That's the fix. 8 hours of debugging. 2 lines changed. Hold the lock for less time. Tale as old as time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Takeaways&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;GDB is cracked for deadlocks. Logs can't show you thread state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;thread apply all bt&lt;/code&gt;hits different.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random threads showing up? Suspicious. If you see thread pools you didn't spawn, figure out who did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your dependencies have dependencies. Somewhere in that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Cargo.lock&lt;/code&gt;is a threading model waiting to fight yours.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heartbeat threads are free. A few lines to detect "stuck" is worth it for any critical loop. They're just a lil guy. Let them watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fix is always smaller than the hunt. Always. Without exception. It's almost annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;I submitted a PR to rerun adding docs about this. Maybe the next person finds the warning before they find the bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The robot runs now. Hasn't frozen since. The LiDAR streams beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I will never call into a library I don't fully understand while holding a mutex again. Fool me once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;BirdyChat becomes the first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 14, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we are excited to share a big milestone. BirdyChat is now the first chat app in Europe that can exchange messages with WhatsApp under the Digital Markets Act. This brings us closer to our mission of giving work conversations a proper home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp is currently rolling out interoperability support across Europe. As this rollout continues, the feature will become fully available to both BirdyChat and WhatsApp users in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, you could only message people who already had a BirdyChat account. If someone was not on the app, they had to download it before you could talk. It slowed down adoption and made it harder to move real work conversations into BirdyChat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the new WhatsApp interface mandated by the DMA, any BirdyChat user in the EEA will be able to start a chat with any WhatsApp user in the region simply by knowing their phone number. Your contacts keep using WhatsApp. You stay on BirdyChat. Messages flow both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This removes a big barrier to adopting BirdyChat for work. You no longer need to ask people to switch apps. You can keep work neatly organised in BirdyChat while staying connected to everyone who still relies on WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What interoperability lets you do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interoperability lets you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start 1:1 chats with WhatsApp users using their phone number&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Send messages, photos and files&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Communicate over an encrypted connection&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use your work email as your identity instead of a personal phone number&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes it much easier to keep work and personal life separate while staying fully reachable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the integration works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp introduced Third-Party Chats in Europe earlier this year. BirdyChat connects through this official DMA interface and does not use any workarounds. All communication between BirdyChat and WhatsApp users is end-to-end encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, BirdyChat supports 1:1 chats, with group chat interoperability coming in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Availability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature will roll out gradually to BirdyChat users across the European Economic Area. For interoperability to work, both you and your WhatsApp contacts need to be based in the EEA. Since WhatsApp is releasing interoperability as part of a gradual rollout, availability may differ slightly from country to country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get early access&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BirdyChat is invite-only while we scale access. Join the waitlist with your work email to be among the first to try WhatsApp interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Productively yours,&lt;lb/&gt;Team BirdyChat&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;25 Propositions about the New Romanticism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A blueprint for the future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article would normally be behind a paywall. But I’m making it freely available to all readers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you find value in this analysis and want to read articles like this in the future, I encourage you to take out a premium subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More than two years ago, I predicted the rise of a New Romanticism—a movement to counter the intense rationalization and expanding technological control of society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This idea had started as a joke. Oh Beethoven, come save us! And give Tchaikovsky the news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when I dug deeply into the history of the original Romanticist movement, circa 1800, I stopped laughing. The more I probed, the more I was convinced that this provided a blueprint for countering the overreach of technology, the massive expansion in surveillance, and the centralization of both political and economic power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It had worked back then. The Age of Romanticism had seen the abolition of slavery, protections for workers, prohibitions on child labor, a growing respect for human dignity, and a blossoming of the arts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Industrialists wept. But somehow they survived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Romanticism had countered cold profit-driven industrialization with human values. And economic growth had actually accelerated in response to this more balanced approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could it happen again? I thought it could. And now, two years, later, I’m convinced that the shift is already underway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how I described it back then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From “Notes Toward a New Romanticism” (November 2023)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I realized that, the more I looked at what happened circa 1800, the more it reminded me of our current malaise.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Rationalist and algorithmic models were dominating every sphere of life at that midpoint in the Industrial Revolution—and people started resisting the forces of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Companies grew more powerful, promising productivity and prosperity. But Blake called them “dark Satanic mills” and Luddites started burning down factories—a drastic and futile step, almost the equivalent of throwing away your smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even as science and technology produced amazing results, dysfunctional behaviors sprang up everywhere. The pathbreaking literary works from the late 1700s reveal the dark side of the pervasive techno-optimism—Goethe’s novel about Werther’s suicide, the Marquis de Sade’s nasty stories, and all those gloomy Gothic novels. What happened to the Enlightenment?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As the new century dawned, the creative class (as we would call it today) increasingly attacked rationalist currents that had somehow morphed into violent, intrusive forces in their lives—an 180 degree shift in the culture. For Blake and others, the name Newton became a term of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Artists, especially poets and musicians, took the lead in this revolt. They celebrated human feeling and emotional attachments—embracing them as more trustworthy, more flexible, more desirable than technology, profits, and cold calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the two years since I wrote that, the notion of a New Romanticism has spread like a wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For valuable commentary on the subject, you should check out Ross Barkan, Santiago Ramos, Dr. Anjan Chatterjee, Kate Alexandra, Megha Lillywhite, and Campbell Frank Scribner. That’s just a start.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The new Romanticon Substack, launched in September, is now an important part of the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I see hints of the New Romanticism in the most popular TV series (Severance, Pluribus, Yellowstone, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The extraordinary growth in romance, fantasy, romantasy and other fanciful literary genres tells the same story. Many readers are seeking an escape from hard-headed realism in the current moment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I find sympathetic voices among public intellectuals—many of them mentioned here in recent months (Jonathan Haidt, Charles Taylor, Iain McGilchrist, Jennifer Frey, Paul Kingsnorth, Byung-Chul Han, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These people lack political or economic power. But they reflect the new attitude of the public—and that will become increasingly clear as the US approaches election day later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This movement is not going away. It will only intensify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a long time, I’ve wanted to write more on the New Romanticism. Given the growing momentum of this movement, now is probably a good time to define it more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that goal, I’m sharing 25 propositions. These will help you anticipate future events—at least that’s my goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Others will probably have a slightly different take on this—so I can’t claim any sweeping authority for my statements. These simply outline what this movement means to me, and where I think it’s heading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;THE NEW ROMANTICISM: 25 PROPOSITIONS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important things in human life can’t be reduced to software code or numbers on a spreadsheet. Here are some of them: Love, Trust, Compassion, Friendship, Forgiveness, Faith, Hope, Charity, Creative Expression, Integrity, Nature, Kindness, Beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the key parameters of the Romanticist life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In ages of intense Rationalism, these things get marginalized—or in some cases eradicated. It’s no coincidence that people are struggling in the current environment to find love, friendship, trust, etc. The rationalist system is not built to foster these human connections—even the largest data center can’t generate them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rationalism has created tremendous benefits for society, but in its final stages it becomes self-serving. The system aims to expand its control no matter the consequences for people inside the system. It starts to feel intrusive and oppressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is happening right now. Rationalism has become voracious and refuses to recognize any limits. It wants to swallow up everything. All human things get turned into an app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even art and inspiration get replaced by inhuman data—beauty becomes one more output from a cold unfeeling system. The system now wants you to work to assist the expansion of data. And your own value is reduced to the ways your personal data can get monetized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t stop there. The system urges you to seek out more data in your playtime. You even have the option of falling in love with a data construct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;5.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve reached an endgame where this process turns into a mockery of language. The word progress no longer refers to actual progress, merely an expansion of technological control—so every software upgrade feels like a downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same is true of the word productivity. Productivity gains are now the source of widespread unemployment and impoverishment—because only a few technocrats capture the economic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The word science also gets tainted. Scientific information is increasingly indistinguishable from propaganda—so much so that the predominant use of new tech is to produce fakery (fake images, fake video, fake books, fake people, all the way to fake answers on a test).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole system feels like it’s built on deception in the service of the will to power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Romanticism flips the equation—the system is forced to serve the people, instead of the people serving the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;7.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as there is a New Romanticism, there is also a New Rationalism. A typical exponent is the criminal financier Sam Bankman-Fried, who mocked Shakespeare (although SBH would “never read a book”—so how could he judge literature?), and tried to reduce human values to a kind of maximization problem on a math test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other exponents of the New Rationalism are individuals who seem strangely drained of emotion and human connection—Thiel, Musk, Altman, Zuckerberg, etc. This is the Rationalist character type—a zero degree of personality. They are people you would trust with a spreadsheet, but not to babysit your child or care for an elder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;8.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This zero personality type is obsessed with AI—the god created in its own image—which becomes the defining technology of the New Rationalism. But no matter how smart AI gets, it will never create an app that can forgive. Or fall in love. Or feel the pangs of parenthood. Or grieve the death of a loved one. Or grasp the sublime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;9.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will try to mimic all these things. That’s the travesty of the dominant data-built system—a built-in dishonesty. You can tell that Rationalism is now reaching its breaking point because of the intense level of deceit and pretense it now requires to expand its sphere of control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;10.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pretense is also an admission that AI needs that human dimension—human feeling is essential to its goals but impossible to achieve. With every move it makes, the technocracy shows its hunger for the same humanism it’s working to destroy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;11.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This rationalist world has gradually been drained of enchantment. The shift to life via digital apps and interfaces represents the final stage of disenchantment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;12.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People now feel the horror and claustrophobia of this imposed disenchantment. This creates a hunger for magic that the system cannot provide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;13.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Romanticism aims to recover enchantment—at first for individuals, but ultimately for groups and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why Romanticism nurtures creativity, storytelling, self-expression, emotion, ecstasy, aesthetic awe—things that can’t be manipulated like data and content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;14.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rationalism tries to compensate for its lack of a soul by imitating a religion or cult. It establishes its own dogmas and rituals with the fervor of true believers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of people already treat AI as a kind of god. That’s not happenstance, but symptomatic of this tendency. The participant in the rationalist belief system also needs a higher power, and finds it in the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;15.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systematized rationalism is about total control. That’s inevitable in any worldview without a moral compass. So it doesn’t respect human limits—but has an inherent urge to expand its sphere of control, no matter what consequences ensue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are in great danger when science and technology grow faster than our moral awareness of how to use the tools they create. The same thing happened during the Industrial Revolution—until the Romanticist backlash imposed constraints and reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until that took place, factory owners and plantation bosses treated humans as mere inputs in a cold rationalized process. The similarities with our current situation are hard to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;16.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point even the scientists lose control—as we learned when they invented nuclear weapons or gunpowder or coronaviruses. The people who built the atomic bomb could only hand it off to the most powerful politicians. That inevitably happened in every country where nuclear weapons were made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If AI achieves the degree of power its proponents predict, the same handoff will happen. It will become another tool of control for entrenched rulers. To expect otherwise is naive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;17.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Romanticism is the opposite of all this. It is about maintaining some small space of freedom from total control. It protects people, not a hierarchy of machines and machine owners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;18.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ages of intense rationalized control do not last forever. They create an inevitable backlash by pushing to extremes. This is why the industrialization of Europe led to the great age of Romanticism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Romanticists demanded protections for workers, laws against child labor, an end to slavery, and other defenses against total control of a rationalized system. Something like this will happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;19.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A counterculture is always inherently Romantic. It resists the overreach of the dominant system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A society that doesn’t listen to its counterculture—or, worse, tries to silence it—has destroyed its most valuable feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;20.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dominant system today is built on analysis. And it’s worth remembering that the root meaning of analysis is the reduction of things into parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holistic thinking, in contrast, is always inherently Romantic. You can also call this visionary thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;21.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal isn’t to stop Rationalism. The goal is to make it serve human ends. Instead the system is moving hellbent in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;22.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even Romanticism can be pushed to dangerous extremes. When it rose as a counterweight to the Enlightenment, circa 1800, the Romanticist impulse had a healthy influence on society for a period of roughly fifty years. Then it got entangled in intense nationalist rivalries and other dysfunctional trends. So anything I say in favor of Romanticism is solely with regard to the current context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the present moment, it would provide a healthy corrective. But that doesn’t mean that the Romanticist impulse is beneficial in every setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;23.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Healing begins with each individual. This is still possible, even in repressive situations. Rebellion emerges first in the inner life—which the Rationalists can’t control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s always the initial step in Romanticist eras. Individuals nurture their inner life. Then they can form communities and push for more humane policies and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;24.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rationalism appears powerful, but is actually vulnerable—because it’s empty inside. It lacks a heart and soul. In any real conflict, this is a huge weakness—because conflicts are won by the most passionate, not by the most rigorously analytical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;25.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The New Romanticism is more than an intellectual movement. It will be promoted by people who don’t even recognize that label. They will demand a more human-oriented society. They will care about creative expression. They will seek to nurture their souls—and do so without apologies, not worrying about what can be quantified or measured. They recognize the value of intangibles, and the dead-end of a data-driven life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is already starting to happen—the movement is gaining strength even at this very moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I will revisit this subject in the future. Others will too—because this conflict in worldviews is now too large to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
