  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I set out to write a program that would allow me to do basic digital photography on the Apple II, I decided I would do it with the Quicktake cameras. It seemed the obvious choice as they were Apple cameras, and their interface to the computer is via serial port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scope creeped a bit after managing to decode Quicktake 100 photos. I wanted it to be able to decode Quicktake 150 and Quicktake 200 pictures too. This threw me into image processing much more than I initially wanted to. This article explains the process of how I got the Quicktake 150 decoder to a reasonabl-ish speed on a 6502 at 1MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Quicktake 150 format is proprietary and undocumented. Free software decoders exist though, in the dcraw project. This was my source for the initial Apple II decoder. Sadly, it is written in C, is extremely non-documented, and is extremely hard to read and understand (to me). The compression is based on Huffman coding, with variable-length codes (which means bit-shifting), and the image construction involves a lot of 16-bits math. None of this is good on a 6502.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But first I had to rework the original algorithm to work with bands of 20 pixels, for memory reasons. Once I had a functional decoder, it ran perfectly, but it took… seventy minutes to decode a single picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, I didn’t get there that fast. My first implementation was released two years ago, in November 2023. Getting where I’m now took, I think, five or six deep dives with each time, one or two weeks worth of late evenings and full week-ends dedicated to progressing, wading through hundreds or thousands of debug printf()s, gdb’ing, variables and offsets comparisons, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Follow me through the algorithmic iterations that allowed me to get that decoding time to under one minute. My implementation is now full assembly, but the commits I will link to here are to the general decoding algorithm, that is easier to read in C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have noticed that hand-optimizing assembler yields good results, but usually optimizing the algorithm itself leads to much more impressive speed gains. Doing too many things faster is not as good as doing the minimum faster. And that Quicktake 150 decoder sure did useless things, especially in my case where I don’t care about color and end up with a 256×192 image!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have made a specific repository to track these algorithmic changes. It started here (already a little bit deobfuscated compared to dcraw), at 301 millions x86_64 instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dropping color&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t have to decode color at all, as I was going to drop it, anyway. I added a flag to only decode the green pixels out of the Bayer matrix, and drop the rest. 264M instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding the buffers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then set out to understand the use of the various temporary buffers: the more buffers, the more intermediary steps, the more copy and looping. I wanted to drop as much of them as possible. The first step towards it was unrolling some little imbricated loops that worked on y [1,2], x [col+1,col]. 238M instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured I still had extra processing I didn’t need, removed it, dropped a buffer (and dropped the #ifdef COLOR conditional to make things clearer). 193M instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, my implementation still outputted green pixels only in a Bayer matrix to a 640×480 buffer, and then interpolated them. It was useless, so I dropped that entirely. 29M instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still had half the pixels black in the destination buffer, so I dropped them earlier rather than later, by outputting a 320×240 images with only the relevant pixels. 25M instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I was able to figure out that out of the three buf_m[3], only buf_m[1] was used to construct the picture, that buf_m[2] was only used to feed back into buf_m[0] at the start of a row, that I could construct the image from the buf_m[1] values on the fly instead of doing an extra loop on it, and that I could entirely drop it too. This allowed me to rename the last remaining buffer for more clarity. 22M instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optimizing divisions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was about it for the buffers. The rework of the code, at that point, made clear that every final pixel value was computed by dividing the 16-bits values computed from the image data by a given factor, and that this factor changes at most once every two rows. The result of that division was then clamped to [0-255]. This allowed me to precompute a division table every two rows, storing the final result, pre-clamped, in a simple array. This also came with a bit of non-visible precision loss. On an x86_64, still 22M instructions, but on 6502, this was a huge gain, transforming 153600 divisions into less than 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I verified the precision loss was acceptable using a small ad-hoc tool displaying my output buffers and comparing the reference decoding to the approximated one. Pixel values differ by at most 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output index&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far we set the output buffer using the usual buffer[y*WIDTH+x] access method, which is really slow on a processor with no multiplication support. I changed that to a much simpler line-by-line indexing. (Even on x86_64, the change is notable: 20M instructions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huffman decoding&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The algorithm initialized full tables so that it was possible to get a Huffman code by just looking at the bitbuffer: for code 10001, for example, all codes from 10001000 to 10001111 were matched to the correct value, then the bitbuffer shifted &amp;lt;&amp;lt;5. This seems good at first, but not on 6502, as this requires a 16-bits bitbuffer to make sure we always have a full byte to look at. I reworked that to get bits one at a time. This made the x86_64 implementation slower, but the 6502 one 20 seconds faster, spending 9 seconds shifting bits instead of 29. It also allowed me to pack the tables more tight, freeing up some memory for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assembly&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This algorithm still performs very poorly when compiled by cc65, but is far easier to manually translate into optimized 6502 assembly. There are also a lot of ad-hoc optimisations, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The division factor for final pixel values for a pair of rows is 48 more than 50% of the time, on any image I tested. So the 6502 implementation has two divisions lookup tables, one for 48 that is never recomputed, one for another factor, recomputed if needed at the start of a pair of rows.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The row initialization multiplies all 320 next_line values by a factor, which is 255 about 66% of the time. In this case, instead of multiplying a = a*255, the assembly version does (a*256)-a, which is (a&amp;lt;&amp;lt;8)-a, which is much faster.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is a whole lot of &amp;lt;&amp;lt;4 going on in the main loop, which is lookup-table based in the assembly implementation. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;4 is larger than 8 bits, so there are two tables needed, but it still is worth the memory usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Half the Huffman codes read are discarded (they are used for blue and red pixels), so “discarder” functions are used in that case, only shifting the bitbuffer without fetching the value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Buffers accesses (to next_line and output buffer) are patched in self-modifying code rather than using zero-page pointers, which require to keep track and patch about 54 labels on each page cross. This is ugly as hell, but this requires about 50k cycles per image, but spares 9M cycles overall.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final code&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have pointed to commits to my “test” repository so far, but if you’re interested in the actual 6502 implementation, you can find it in my repository: the decoder, and the bitbuffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Questions remain&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There still are things I don’t understand in dcraw’s decoder, that my simplifications didn’t uncover. The main thing I wonder is, how did Dave Coffin, dcraw’s author, implement this decoder first? It seems so full of “magic” numbers and arithmetic operations that I have no idea how one would look at pictures at the bit level, and figure out anything about the format. Did he reverse-engineer Apple’s binary? Did he have documentation? Is it in fact a common kind of encoding I have no idea about?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would love to see documentation of this format, maybe I would understand more and be able to progress further.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What if I don't want videos of my hobby time available to the entire world?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am very much enjoying my newly-resurrected hobby of Airsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running around in the woods, firing small plastic pellets at other people, in pursuit of a contrived-to-be-fun mission, turns out to be, well, fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have also had to accept that, for some other players, part of that fun comes from making videos of their game days, and uploading them to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They often have quite impressive setups, with multiple cameras - head, rear-facing from barrel of weapon, and scope cam - and clearly put time, money, and effort into doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great! Just like someone taking photos on their holidays, or when out and about, I can see the fun in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is the “non-consensually publishing it online for the world to see” aspect which bugs me a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the handful of games that I have played, no-one has ever asked about consent of other participants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has been no “put on this purple lanyard if you don’t want to be included in the public version of the video” rule, which I’ve seen work pretty well at conferences I have attended (even if it is opt-out rather than consent).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could, I suppose, ask each person that I see with a camera “would you mind not including me in anything you upload, please?”. And, since everyone with whom I’ve spoken at games, so far anyway, has been perfectly pleasant and friendly, I’d be hopeful that they would at least consider my request. I have not done this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The impression I get is that this is just seen as part and parcel of the hobby: by running around in the woods of northern Newbury on a Sunday morning, I need to accept that I may well appear on YouTube, for the world to see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t love it, but it is not a big enough deal for me to make a fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I occasionally see people saying “well, if you don’t want to be in photos published online, don’t be in public spaces”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is nonsense, for a number of reasons. Clearly, one should be able to exist in society, including going outside one’s own home, without needing to accept this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, here, the issue is somewhat different, since it is a private site, where people engage in private activity (a hobby).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then I’ve seen the same at (private) conferences, with people saying “Of course I’m free to take photos of identifiable individuals without their consent and publish them online”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publishing someone’s photo online, without their consent, without another strong justification, just because they happen to be in view of one’s camera lens, feels wrong to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t about what is legal (although, in some cases, claims of legality may be poorly conceived), but around my own perceptions of a private life, and a dislike for the fact that, just because one can publish such things, that one should.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;[Updated] Some more notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I’m just blogging. Sharing my thoughts. I’m not trying to set anyone’s policy, demand that anyone takes anything down or stops doing anything, or change anyone’s view.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I am in the UK. Different places may well have different norms, laws, and expectations. But this is just about something which bugs me a bit, not what the legal rights and wrongs might be. Plus, I don’t think that anyone (that I’ve seen so far) is doing this meanly or nefariously. This is just part of the fun for them, and fun is important.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yes, biodegradable BBs are available, although it is not a site requirement, and the site shop does not sell them. I have used them a couple of times, and I haven’t found them to shatter on impact as much as (non-biodegradable) tracer BBs. I tend to buy BBs from the site’s own shop, to support them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yes, I wear two-part face covering; goggles/glasses (depending on the heat and humidity), and a lower face and ear mask. I prefer this to a full face mask. But players are still pretty obviously distinguishable, given differences in loadouts, patches they wear, and people shouting names. Few people wear face coverings in the “safe zone” (where one rests, eats/drinks, chats, loads up etc.), which are sometimes included in videos.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;over&lt;code&gt;emacs&lt;/code&gt;;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;waves at everyone from HN. Thanks for a pleasant, thought-provoking, discussion, with numerous different perspectives.&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The loneliness epidemic threatens physical health like smoking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Loneliness increases death risk by 32% but we know how to fix it. Real solutions that cut loneliness in half, from mindfulness to community programs that actually work.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chronic loneliness increases mortality risk by 32% and dementia risk by 31%, with biological pathways now proven through inflammation, immune dysfunction, and epigenetic changes affecting over 2.2 million studied individuals. Evidence-based interventions combining cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and community programs demonstrate measurable success — with some achieving 48% reduction in loneliness within six months and generating £3.42 in healthcare savings per £1 invested. The most effective individual strategies include structured 8-week mindfulness programs reducing daily loneliness by 22%, while community-based social prescribing has reached 9.4 million healthcare visits in the UK alone, proving that this epidemic is both scientifically understood and practically treatable through targeted interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking alot about loneliness lately. Not because I’m particularly lonely myself. Living between two cultures sometimes makes you feel like you’re standing in a doorway that belongs to neither room. But because everywhere I look, I see people drowning in it, and nobody seems to talk about it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, my neighbor a sweet elderly woman who always greets me in the hallway told me she hadn’t had a real conversation in three weeks. Three weeks. And she’s not alone in being alone, if that makes sense. When I moved from Germany to write here, I thought the hardness would be the language or finding good bread (still looking, by the way). But what really hits you is how many people are carrying this invisible weight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We treat loneliness like it’s just feeling sad or maybe needing to get out more. But your body? Your body treats it like you’re being hunted by a wolf. I’m serious. The research shows loneliness literally changes how our genes work, makes our immune system go haywire, increases our chance of dying young by almost a third. A third! That’s more dangerous than obesity, and we have entire industries built around fighting that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is, I grew up in a Turkish family where being alone was practically impossible. There’s always someone dropping by for tea, always a cousin calling, always food being shared. But even in my family now, I see it creeping in. My uncle in Berlin, divorced last year, suddenly looks ten years older. My friend’s daughter, surrounded by hundreds of Instagram friends, tells me she feels completely disconnected from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Loneliness operates as an immunometabolic syndrome&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent meta-analyses examining 2.2 million individuals across 90 cohort studies reveal that social isolation and loneliness trigger measurable biological cascades comparable to traditional disease risk factors. The physiological response involves 175 proteins associated with disease pathways, with Growth Differentiation Factor 15 showing the strongest link to social isolation (OR 1.22) and PCSK9 to loneliness (OR 1.15). These proteins directly influence cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurodegenerative disease processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inflammatory response stands out as the primary mechanism. Lonely individuals show consistently elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and fibrinogen levels, creating a state of chronic inflammation. This “Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity” involves upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes while simultaneously downregulating antiviral responses, leaving lonely individuals more vulnerable to infections while their bodies attack themselves through inflammation. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis becomes dysregulated, producing flattened cortisol rhythms and glucocorticoid resistance that perpetuates inflammation even when stress hormones are elevated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Epigenetic aging accelerates measurably in lonely individuals. The GrimAge biological clock advances faster than chronological age (β = 0.07, p = 0.003), mediating 20% of the relationship between loneliness and multiple chronic diseases. Twenty-five specific DNA methylation sites change with loneliness, primarily affecting inflammatory and metabolic pathways. These changes aren’t just correlational — they represent causal mechanisms linking social experience to physical disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scientific interventions achieve measurable success rates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analysis of 256 randomized controlled trials reveals that evidence-based interventions can effectively reduce loneliness, with success rates varying by approach and population. Cognitive behavioral therapy emerges as the most rigorously tested intervention, achieving effect sizes of 0.43–0.66 across multiple studies. The key lies in targeting maladaptive social cognitions — the negative thought patterns that perpetuate loneliness regardless of actual social contact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-component interventions show the highest effectiveness at 85% success rate when combining social skills training, cognitive restructuring, social support enhancement, and behavioral activation. A Barcelona community program achieved remarkable results: 48.3% of participants no longer felt lonely after 18 sessions combining education, mindfulness, yoga, and neighbor-organized activities, compared to 26.9% of controls. Mental health scores improved from 36 to 48 on the SF-12 scale, while depressive symptoms nearly halved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mindfulness-based interventions demonstrate particular promise through smartphone delivery. A 14-day program requiring just 20 minutes daily reduced loneliness by 22% while increasing social interactions by two per day. The critical factor was the “Monitor + Accept” approach — observing lonely feelings without judgment proved essential, as monitoring alone showed no benefit. This suggests that acceptance orientation toward present-moment experiences, rather than fighting loneliness, facilitates social connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Animal-assisted interventions achieved 100% effectiveness in studies with older adults, whether using living animals, robotic pets, or virtual companions. Group-based programs consistently outperformed individual interventions, with optimal duration ranging from 8–34 weeks. Sessions incorporating active participation, skill-building, and between-session practice showed superior outcomes to passive support groups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here’s what I keep coming back to. We know loneliness is killing people. Literally rewiring their bodies to self-destruct. We know exactly how to help them. But we’re still treating it like some personal weakness instead of the health crisis it really is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I think about my neighbor, about my uncle, about all the people quietly suffering behind closed doors, I get angry. Not at them, but at how we’ve built a world where feeling disconnected is normal. Where asking for help feels like failure. In my Turkish family, we have this saying about how a shared meal makes the table stronger but somewhere along the way, we forgot to keep setting places for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research I’ve been reading, it gives me hope though. Those programs in Barcelona where almost half the people stopped feeling lonely? The mindfulness stuff that works in just two weeks? Even the robot pets for elderly people “it all works”. We’re not talking about maybe or possibly here. This stuff actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What gets me is that fixing loneliness doesn’t require some massive revolution. Twenty minutes of mindfulness a day. A weekly volunteer shift. Even just accepting that you feel lonely instead of fighting it. That alone makes a difference. In the UK they’re writing prescriptions for social activities and saving money while saving lives. If that’s not proof that we can turn this around, I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess what I’m trying to say is, if you’re reading this and feeling that hollow ache of disconnection, you’re not broken. Your body is having a totally normal response to an abnormal situation. And there are real, tested ways to feel better “not perfect, but better”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t need to accept loneliness as the price of modern life. We know too much now to keep pretending it’s just in people’s heads. It’s in their blood, their genes, their mortality statistics. But more importantly, we know how to heal it. We just need to start taking it as seriously as any other threat to human health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the end, we’re not meant to do this alone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;None of us are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Networks are a central visual and analytical feature of this map. Here’s a breakdown of the networks present, what they mean, and how they relate to the map’s context:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Oil and Gas Pipeline Networks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Major Pipelines: Heavy lines traverse the map, notably from Iraq (Kirkuk) to the Mediterranean (Tripoli, Haifa), from the Persian Gulf inland, and across the Arabian Peninsula. These pipelines connect oilfields to export terminals and refineries, forming the literal backbone of the Middle Eastern oil economy. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Example: The Iraq Petroleum Company pipeline runs from northern Iraq westward to the Mediterranean.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Additional Examples: Pipelines from Abadan (Iran), Dhahran-Dammam (Saudi Arabia), and Kuwait to coastlines and terminals.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Legend: The legend at lower center distinguishes between types of pipelines (existing, under construction, projected).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Oilfield and Refinery Networks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fields and Refineries: Networks of oilfields (clusters of wells, symbolized by icons) are shown in: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Southeastern Iran&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Kuwait&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Eastern Saudi Arabia (Ghawar, Dhahran)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Northern Iraq&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bahrain&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Qatar&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Baku (Azerbaijan)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Refineries and Terminals: These are networked nodes, connected by pipelines and shipping routes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Concession and Ownership Networks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Company Areas: Shaded patterns and color blocks delineate which multinational or national company controls which areas. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Inset tables and lower text blocks list the principal owners, revealing a web of corporate and political control stretching across national borders.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Contracts and Permits: These are mapped as overlapping zones, emphasizing the legal and economic network underlying physical infrastructure.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Maritime and Shipping Networks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tanker Terminals: Coastal nodes show where oil is loaded for maritime transport, connecting Middle Eastern production to global consumption.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shipping Routes: While not always explicitly drawn, the proximity of terminals to major sea lanes (Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Mediterranean) suggests the networked nature of oil export.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Regional and International Networks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inset Maps: Marginal insets provide high-density detail for network nodes (e.g., Kuwait, Dhahran, Baku), showing how networks become denser at critical points.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transnational Connections: Pipelines and concession boundaries frequently cross modern political borders, underlining the supra-national character of the oil network.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interpretive Significance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technical and Political Network: The map reveals not just the physical infrastructure but the political-economic web of relationships—companies, concession boundaries, and intergovernmental arrangements.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Historical Context: In 1965, these networks were dominated by Western companies, but the complexity also hints at coming shifts (nationalization, OPEC).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Integrated System: The map visually asserts that the Middle East’s oil is not a collection of isolated sites, but a tightly interwoven system shaping global politics and economics.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The map is a diagram of networks—pipelines, oilfields, terminals, company concessions, and shipping routes—depicting the Middle East’s oil as a vast, interdependent system. These networks are both physical (infrastructure) and abstract (ownership, contracts), making the map a powerful tool for understanding the strategic importance and international entanglement of oil in the mid-20th century. AI analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Friction is necessary for Growth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The title of this article says it all. Overcoming friction leads to growth. Comfort leads to stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT and by extension “AI” is likely the biggest “revolution” of my generation. It is likely also going to be the biggest killer of creativity in my generation. I always thought the creativity killer was going to be access to infinite entertainment. I think I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve come to believe that with the rise of convenience and comfort, it becomes harder for us to reach our potential. Technology and Capitalism is taking us towards an extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A certain level of convenience can lead to efficiency gains. Automation is important for a reason. Too much convenience though, that's a killer. When friction was inherent in the system, applying ourselves led to growth as we overcame that friction. We simply didn’t have an alternative that was viable. And this principle applies to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was a child in Sri Lanka, I ended up memorizing the landline numbers of all my close relatives. To this day I remember them. The moment I got a phone where my contacts could be saved, I stopped remembering numbers. It may seem like a small thing but it illustrates the principle. The ease of access to information has geared us towards efficiently looking up information instead of remembering it. I won't argue the utility of having hundreds of numbers saved on your phone, I simply want to make a point. Overcoming friction leads to growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's take another activity where creativity is important, writing. When it's easier to prompt ChatGPT to write your college essay, you'll never apply yourself. Afterall, when everyone is doing it, why not you? As everyone uses ChatGPT, the expectation of high quality writing will increase, making it harder for people to be vulnerable. You can’t become a master without making mistakes and learning from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans are creatures of comfort. Just like so many things in this world, we follow the path of least resistance. With access to technology being ubiquitous, and ChatGPT being so widely available, to choose not to use it is very hard. You need to deliberately prioritize your growth and choose to go against the current. You need to deliberately introduce friction to the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, total abstinence is not the solution. ChatGPT is here to stay. Just like most advancements in technology are. As a child of the 21st Century, you’ll need to learn to utilize this new tool in a manner that aids you, not hinders you. More importantly, not hinder the future you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently tried using the Minisforum DEG1 GPU Dock with a Raspberry Pi 500+, using an M.2 to OCuLink adapter, and this chenyang SFF-8611 Cable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After figuring out there's a power button on the DEG1 (which needs to be turned on), and after fiddling around with the switches on the PCB (hidden under the large metal plate on the bottom; TGX to OFF was the most important setting), I was able to get the Raspberry Pi's PCIe bus to at least tell the graphics card installed in the eGPU dock to spin up its fans and initialize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I wasn't able to get any output from the card (using this Linux kernel patch), and &lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt; did not show it. (Nor were there any logs showing errors in &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I switched back to my JMT eGPU OCuLink dock for the rest of my testing, and uploaded a video detailing some of my struggles, and a blog post detailing the Pi 500+ eGPU testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few commenters mentioned they too had issues with the Minisforum DEG1. But a few of them looked closely at the OCuLink cable Minisforum included, and noted there were a couple extra colored wires going through the cable sleeve that didn't seem to be present on other cables—like the chenyang I was using! They suggested I try swapping cables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I did... and testing it with an RX 6500 XT worked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking closely at the cables side by side, I can confirm what some of the commenters said: the cable that came with the DEG1 looks like it has additional colored wires going between the connectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moral of the this portion of the story: not all OCuLink cables are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Going Deeper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then I swapped back to my RX 7900 XT, the one that was previously unrecognized in the Miniforum dock... and it still wouldn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ lspci
0002:00:00.0 PCI bridge: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM2712 PCIe Bridge (rev 30)
0002:01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Raspberry Pi Ltd RP1 PCIe 2.0 South Bridge
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried all three switches in different settings, I tried swapping OCuLink cables back and forth again... nothing. The RX 6500 XT was happy as can be, but the 7900? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I even popped in an Intel B580 card, and it worked too...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ lspci
0001:00:00.0 PCI bridge: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM2712 PCIe Bridge (rev 30)
0001:01:00.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device e2ff (rev 01)
0001:02:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device e2f0
0001:02:02.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device e2f1
0001:03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Battlemage G21 [Arc B580]
0001:04:00.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Device e2f7

0002:01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Raspberry Pi Ltd RP1 PCIe 2.0 South Bridge
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now I'm left scratching my head: what's different about the RX 7900 XT? And why does my cheaper $50 eGPU dock seem to work with everything, but the $99 Minisforum DEG1 doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching through forum posts, I even found someone running a 7900 XT in the DEG1 on a Pi, so maybe it's just a strange fluke with my setup?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inconsistencies like these really bother me. And they usually eat up an entire afternoon, because I'm always certain it's a PEBKAC, and I usually exhaust every route debugging before I'd waste a vendor or a maintainer's time with a bug report!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't yet torn down one of these cables to try to figure out which pins are perhaps missing on the chenyang cable (see OCuLink Pinouts here. The bigger issue there is, I can't find a source for the cable Minisforum includes separate from the DEG1 dock, and most online listings don't clearly show which kind of cable you'll get—with or without the extra wires!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I put my RX 7600 in the Minisforum DEG1 as well; and it exhibited the exact same symptom:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fans spin up after Pi initial startup like it's initializing, then they spin down&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt;shows nothing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tried with every combination of 'Follow Start' and 'TGX' switches toggled on/off&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Switching back to the cheaper dock worked flawlessly (with either cable)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now I'm wondering if the 7000-series AMD graphics cards have a different PCIe initialization scheme that doesn't like something on Minisforum's DEG1 dock? I don't have any other 7000-series cards, besides the XFX Merc 310 (7900) and ASRock Challenger (7600).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: Got the same issue with an RX 460! Not sure what's going on here—but same exact thing, it didn't work in Minisforum dock, worked fine in cheaper JMT dock. Same power supply, same cables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also got that same Minisforum dock and hooked it up to a PI 5 with a 7600 XT. I had no issues. Didn't have to open it and change any switches, it worked first try. I am using the cable it came with. Haven't tried the new patch but I plan to soon. I was using it for llms though and did not hook it up to a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sounds like it might be a voltage drop issue?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've tested with two power supplies that have been extremely reliable (Lian Li 750W and Corsair RMx 650W), and the same power supply and cabling works fine in the JMT dock (I just move the cables over when I switch docks). So unless the Minisforum has something on it pulling a ton of power when a card ramps up, it doesn't seem like that'd be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stranger things have happened, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How the Brain Balances Excitation and Inhibition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Santiago Ramón y Cajal’s hand came branches and whorls, spines and webs. Now-famous drawings by the neuroanatomist in the late 19th and early 20th centuries showed, for the first time, the distinctiveness and diversity of the fundamental building blocks of the mammalian brain that we call neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the century or so since, his successors have painstakingly worked to count, track, identify, label and categorize these cells. There is now a dizzying number of ways to put neurons in buckets, often presented in colorful, complex brain cell atlases. With such catalogs, you might organize neurons based on function by separating motor neurons that help you move from sensory neurons that help you see or number neurons that help you estimate quantities. You might distinguish them based on whether they have long axons or short ones, or whether they’re located in the hippocampus or the olfactory bulb. But the vast majority of neurons, regardless of function, form or location, fall into one of two fundamental categories: excitatory neurons that trigger other neurons to fire and inhibitory neurons that stop others from firing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining the correct proportion of excitation to inhibition is critical for keeping the brain healthy and harmonious. “Imbalances in either direction can be really catastrophic,” said Mark Cembrowski, a neuroscientist at the University of British Columbia, or lead to neurological conditions. Too much excitation and the brain can produce epileptic seizures. Too little excitation can be associated with conditions such as autism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are working to uncover how these two classes of cells work — and specifically, how they interact with a rarer third category of cells that influence their behavior. These insights could eventually help reveal how to restabilize networks that get out of balance, which can even occur as a result of normal aging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Balance Is Key&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excitatory and inhibitory neurons work in similar ways. Most release chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters, which travel across the tiny gaps known as synapses and dock onto cuplike proteins called receptors on the next neuron. What distinguishes excitatory and inhibitory neurons is the type of neurotransmitters they release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excitatory neurons in the brain almost exclusively release glutamate when they activate, or fire. Glutamate triggers a bunch of positive ions to flood into a neuron, increasing its internal voltage and spurring it to fire an action potential, a strong burst of electricity that travels down a nerve fiber and makes the neuron release its own set of molecules to communicate with others, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, when inhibitory neurons fire, they release a neurotransmitter known as GABA that triggers negatively charged ions to flood into the neighboring neuron or positively charged ions to flood out. With a lower internal voltage, the next neuron won’t fire. Inhibitory neurons “function as sort of a breaker,” said Tomasz Nowakowski, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These stops and gos enable a highway system in the brain, ensuring that the signals end up in the correct places at the correct times, so that you can grab the apple on your desk, hum your favorite tune or remember where you left your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the mammalian cortex, excitatory neurons vastly outnumber inhibitory ones. But throughout mammalian brain evolution, inhibitory neurons have diversified and increased in quantity, suggesting that they play critical roles in higher-order functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inhibitory neurons have “often been ascribed support roles,” said Annabelle Singer, a neuroscientist and neuroengineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University. That’s likely because it’s simply easier to study excitatory neurons. For example, an excitatory place cell in the hippocampus can fire when an animal is in a particular location. When this happens, its excitation of other cells can be observed. “It’s very clear-cut,” she said. But an inhibitory neuron “fires a lot everywhere, and it’s much harder to say what is it responding to,” she said. We don’t know what signal it is inhibiting, and the cells connected to it don’t respond with firing of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, studies are starting to illuminate how and when inhibitory neurons fire. In a recent study published in Nature, Singer and her colleagues found that inhibitory neurons help mice learn rapidly and remember where to find food by selectively decreasing how much they fire when the animal is near a location where food can be found. By firing less frequently as the mouse approaches the location, inhibitory neurons enhance the desired signals, thereby “enabling this learning about the important location,” Singer said. This suggests that they play a much more active role in memory than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s more, the prevalent view of inhibitory neurons once cast them as more generalist in their activity, doing this kind of “blanket-y inhibition, inhibiting everything that is around their axons,” said Nuno Maçarico da Costa, a neuroscientist at the Allen Institute. But da Costa and his team, as part of the Microns project, a large-scale effort to fully map out a 1-cubic-millimeter portion of a mouse’s visual cortex, discovered that inhibitory neurons are very specific in choosing what cells to inhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brain’s circuits are all built from a mixture of inhibitory and excitatory cells conversing in diverse ways. For example, some inhibitory cells prefer to send signals to another neuron’s little branches called dendrites, while others send signals to a neuron’s cell body. Others tag team to inhibit certain other cells. These different moving parts weave together, through mechanisms not entirely understood, to create our reactions, thoughts, memories and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But neurons communicate thousands of times faster than the cognitive effects they generate, transmitting signals in tens of milliseconds or less. “Neurotransmitters work really fast, but a lot of the behavioral and cognitive components that we need are really slow,” Cembrowski said. This apparent mismatch is “one of the central and great mysteries of the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Third Category&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another category of cells might help to resolve this timing issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neuromodulatory neurons, which are much rarer in the brain, work on slower timescales, but their effects last much longer and are much more widespread. Rather than sending molecules across a synapse exclusively to the next neuron, they can spill their molecules — a subset of neurotransmitters called neuromodulators — into an entire area, where they interact with many different synapses. The molecules they release, such as dopamine or serotonin, lead to changes within excitatory or inhibitory neurons, making them more or less likely to fire. They create “a slow undercurrent of signaling that imparts important changes in the fast dynamics of the brain,” Cembrowski said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the neuromodulator norepinephrine plays a strong role in emotionally charged memory. When released, it helps strengthen connections between neurons that form and reinforce memory, so that they fire more often and thus “guide particularly emotional experiences into memory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These basic identities — excitatory, inhibitory, neuromodulatory — bring some structure to the way that our various types of neurons operate, but their roles can blur. For example, some excitatory and inhibitory neurons also seem to have a neuromodulatory function built into them. A small number of neurons, especially ones related to emotion, can fire GABA and glutamate packaged together, giving them both excitatory and inhibitory properties. Some neurons can switch identities, say, from an excitatory to an inhibitory neuron, under chronic stress and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though much diversity exists within broad categories of neurons — as one brain cell atlas after another is showing — they all enable the rhythm of excitation and inhibition. Neuroscientists are only scratching the surface of what happens when the networks are thrown off balance, but the work could lead to more treatments to fix them, Cembrowski said. “This can make a huge difference, both in individuals’ quality of life and society as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;From its earliest days, digital design practice has been focused on creating interfaces for computers. Screen-based interactions are now mainly happening through smartphones and mobile-first experiences have become the norm. However, as digital designers, we still use computers as our main working tool and continue to browse desktop websites when searching for references. This process makes it difficult to acknowledge a shift and embrace the fact that the Internet isn’t happening where it used to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;loadmo.re showcases distinctive websites for smartphones. Through this archive, we hope to encourage digital designers to take full advantage of the mobile phone’s interface and functionality. We hope that this platform will generate conversation on mobile-first design within our digital communities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Write the damn code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's some popular programming advice these days:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Learn to decompose problems into smaller chunks, be specific about what you want, pick the right AI model for the task, and iterate on your prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, "learn to decompose the problem" — sure. "Iterate on your prompts" — not so much. Write the actual code instead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ask AI for an initial version and then refactor it to match your expectations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write the initial version yourself and ask AI to review and improve it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write the critical parts and ask AI to do the rest.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write an outline of the code and ask AI to fill the missing parts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You probably see the pattern now. Get involved with the code, don't leave it all to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, given the prompt, AI does the job perfectly on first or second iteration — fine. Otherwise, stop refining the prompt. Go write some code, then get back to the AI. You'll get much better results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong: this is not anti-AI advice. Use it, by all means. Use it a lot if you want to. But don't fall into the trap of endless back-and-forth prompt refinement, trying to get the perfect result from AI by "programming in English". It's an imprecise, slow and terribly painful way to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get your hands dirty. Write the code. It's what you are good at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are a software engineer. Don't become a prompt refiner.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Subtleties of SQLite Indexes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last 6 months, Scour has gone from ingesting 330,000 pieces of content per month to over 1.4 million this month. The massive increase in the number of items slowed down the ranking for users' feeds and sent me looking for ways to speed it up again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After spending too many hours trying in vain to squeeze more performance out of my queries and indexes, I dug into how SQLite's query planner uses indexes, learned some of the subtleties that explained why my initial tweaks weren't working, and sped up one of my main queries by ~35%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scour's &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; table&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scour is a personalized content feed that finds articles, blog posts, etc related to users' interests. For better and for worse, Scour does its ranking on the fly whenever users load their feeds page. Initially, this took 100 milliseconds or less, thanks to binary vector embeddings and the fact that it's using SQLite so there is no network latency to load data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important table in Scour's database is the &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; table. It includes an ID, URL, title, language, publish date (stored as a Unix timestamp), and a text quality rating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scour's main ranking query filters items based on when they were published, whether they are in a language the user understands, and whether they are above a certain quality threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question is: what indexes do we need to speed up this query?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don't bother with multiple single-column indexes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first set up Scour's database, I put a bunch of indexes on the &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; table without really thinking about whether they would help. For example, I had separate indexes on the published date, the language, and the quality rating. Useless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's more important to have one or a small handful of good composite indexes on multiple columns than to have separate indexes on each column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases, the query planner won't bother merging the results from two indexes on the same table. Instead, it will use one of the indexes and then scan all of the rows that match the filter for that index's column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's worth being careful to only add indexes that will be used by real queries. Having additional indexes on each column won't hurt read performance. However, each index takes up storage space and more indexes will slow down writes, because all of the indexes need to be updated when new rows are inserted into the table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we're going to have an index on multiple columns, which columns should we include and what order should we put them in?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Index column order matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The order of conditions in a query doesn't matter, but the order of columns in an index very much does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Columns that come earlier in the index should be more "selective": they should help the database narrow the results set as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Scour's case, the most selective column is the publish date, followed by the quality rating, followed by the language. I put an index on those columns in that order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE INDEX idx_items_published_quality_lang
ON items(published, low_quality_probability, lang);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;...and found that SQLite was only using one of the columns. Running this query:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT id, low_quality_probability
FROM items
WHERE published BETWEEN $1 AND $2
AND low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= $3
AND lang IN (SELECT lang FROM user_languages WHERE user_id = $4)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Produced this query plan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QUERY PLAN
   |--SEARCH items USING COVERING INDEX idx_items_published_quality_lang (published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?)
   `--CORRELATED LIST SUBQUERY 1
      `--SCAN user_languages USING COVERING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_user_languages_1
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was using the right index but only filtering by &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt; (note the part of the plan that says &lt;code&gt;(published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?)&lt;/code&gt;). Puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Left to right, no skipping, stops at the first range&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My aha moment came while watching Aaron Francis' High Performance SQLite course. He said the main rule for SQLite indexes is: "Left to right, no skipping, stops at the first range." (This is a much clearer statement of the implications of the Where Clause Analysis buried in the Query Optimizer Overview section of the official docs.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This rule means that the query planner will:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consider columns from left to right. In my case, the first column in the index is &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;. SQLite will search for rows where the&lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;field is in the correct range before considering the other columns.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No skipping means that SQLite cannot use only the 1st and 3rd column in an index. As soon as it reaches a column in the index that does not appear in the query, it must do a scan through all of the rows matching the 1st column.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stops at the first range. That was the key I was missing. Filtering by the &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;timestamp first would indeed narrow down the results more than filtering first by one of the other columns. However, the fact that the query uses a range condition on the&lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;column (&lt;code&gt;WHERE published BETWEEN $1 AND $2&lt;/code&gt;) means that SQLite can only scan all of the rows in that&lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;range, rather than fully utilizing the other columns in the index to hone in on the correct rows.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My query includes two ranges (&lt;code&gt;published BETWEEN $1 AND $2 AND low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= $3&lt;/code&gt;), so the "stops at the first range" rule explains why I was only seeing the query planner use one of those columns. This rule does, however, suggest that I can create an index that will allow SQLite to filter by the one non-range condition (&lt;code&gt;lang IN (SELECT lang FROM user_languages WHERE user_id = $4)&lt;/code&gt;) before using one of the ranges:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE INDEX idx_lang_published_quality
ON items(lang, published, low_quality_probability);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The query plan shows that it can use both the &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt; columns (note the part that reads &lt;code&gt;lang=? AND published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QUERY PLAN
|--SEARCH items USING COVERING INDEX idx_items_lang_published_quality (lang=? AND published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?)
`--LIST SUBQUERY 1
   `--SEARCH user_languages USING COVERING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_user_languages_1 (user_id=?)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we're using two out of the three columns to quickly filter the rows. Can we use all three? (Remember, the query planner won't be able to use multiple range queries on the same index, so we'll need something else.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; conditions for partial indexes must exactly match&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite has a nice feature called Partial Indexes that allows you to define an index that only applies to a subset of the rows matching some conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Scour's case, we only really want items where the &lt;code&gt;low_quality_probability&lt;/code&gt; is less than or equal to 90%. The model I'm using to judge quality isn't that great, so I only trust it to filter out items if it's really sure they're low quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means I can create an index like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE INDEX idx_lang_published_quality_filtered
ON items(lang, published, low_quality_probability)
WHERE low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= .9;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then update the query to use the same &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; condition:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT id, low_quality_probability
FROM items
WHERE low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= 0.9
AND published BETWEEN $1 AND $2
AND low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= $3
AND lang IN (SELECT lang FROM user_languages WHERE id = $4)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it should use our new partial index... right? Wrong. This query is still using the previous index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QUERY PLAN
|--SEARCH items USING COVERING INDEX idx_items_lang_published_quality (lang=? AND published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?)
`--LIST SUBQUERY 1
   `--SEARCH user_languages USING COVERING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_user_languages_1 (user_id=?)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a subtle mistake in the relationship between our index and our query. Can you spot it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our index contains the condition &lt;code&gt;WHERE low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= .9&lt;/code&gt; but our query says &lt;code&gt;WHERE low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= 0.9&lt;/code&gt;. These are mathematically equivalent but they are not exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite's query planner requires the conditions to match exactly in order for it to use a partial index. Relatedly, a condition of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= 0.95&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= 0.5 + 0.4&lt;/code&gt; in the query would also not utilize the partial index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we rewrite our query to use the exact same condition of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= .9&lt;/code&gt;, we get the query plan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QUERY PLAN
|--SEARCH items USING COVERING INDEX idx_lang_published_quality_filtered (ANY(lang) AND published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?)
`--CORRELATED LIST SUBQUERY 1
   `--SCAN user_languages USING COVERING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_user_languages_1
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we're starting with the items whose &lt;code&gt;low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= .9&lt;/code&gt;, then using the index to find the items in the desired language(s), and lastly narrowing down the results to the items that were published in the correct time range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Better query plans find matching rows faster&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the intro, these changes to the indexes and one of Scour's main ranking queries yielded a ~35% speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enabling the query planner to make better use of the indexes makes it so that SQLite doesn't need to scan as many rows to find the ones that match the query conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concretely, in Scour's case, filtering by language removes about 30% of items for most users and filtering out low quality content removes a further 50%. Together, these changes reduce the number of rows scanned by around 66%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, however, a 66% reduction in the number of rows scanned does not directly translate to a 66% speedup in the query. If we're doing more than counting rows, the work to load the data out of the database and process it can be more resource intensive than scanning rows to match conditions. (The optimized queries and indexes still load the same number of rows as before, they just identifying the desired rows faster.) Nevertheless, a 35% speedup is a noticeable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's worth digging into how your database's query planner uses indexes to help get to the bottom of performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're working with SQLite, remember that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A smaller number of composite indexes are more useful that multiple single-column indexes. It's better to have an index over &lt;code&gt;(lang, published, low_quality_probability)&lt;/code&gt;than separate indexes for each.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The query planner uses the rule "Left to right, no skipping, stops at the first range". If a query has multiple range conditions, it may be worth putting the columns that use strict equality first in the index, like we did above with &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt;coming before&lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;low_quality_probability&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conditions used in &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt;clauses for partial indexes must exactly match the condition used in the corresponding query.&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= 0.9&lt;/code&gt;is not exactly the same as&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= .9&lt;/code&gt;, even if they are mathematically equivalent.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Aaron Francis for putting together the High Performance SQLite course! (I have no personal or financial relationship to him, but I appreciate his course unblocking me and helping me speed up Scour's ranking.) Thank you also to Adam Gluck and Alex Kesling for feedback on this post.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;K-means by another means&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait. Does k-means count as machine learning? Yes. Yes, it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CS229 is the graduate-level machine learning course I took at Stanford as part of the Graduate Certificate in AI which I received back in 2021. While k-means is my choice as the easiest to understand algorithm in machine learning, it was taught as the introductory clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning. As a TA for XCS229, which I have been doing since 2022 and most recently did this Spring, I know that it is still being taught as part of this seminal course in AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We have liftoff!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike previously where I saved the result for the end, let’s start by taking a look at the algorithm in action!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of the final decision boundary after convergence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final accuracy is 90% because 1 of the 10 observations is on the incorrect side of the decision boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For debugging purposes, to speed up execution, I reduced the number of samples in each class to 5. (You might note that, on the graph, there are only 4 points in class 1, which are the □s. That’s because one of the points is at &lt;code&gt;(291, 90)&lt;/code&gt;, which is off the edge of the screen. Gaussian distributions can generate extreme outliers, so I decided to preserve those points rather than clip them to the edge of the screen.) That’s obviously pretty small but you can see the algorithm iterating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of each loop I draw a line between the latest estimates of cluster centroids. The perpendicular bisector of these segments are the decision boundaries between the classes, so I draw them, too. Some of the code was written to handle more than two classes but here there are only two which makes this relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;K-means explained&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;K-means clustering is a recursive algorithm that aims to partition \(n\) observations into \(k\) clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, called the cluster centroid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Step&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Initialize&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Produce and initial set of k cluster centroids. This can be done by randomly choosing k observations from the dataset.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Step 1 - Assignment&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Using Euclidean distance to the centroids, assign each observation to a cluster.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Step 2 - Update&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;For each cluster, recompute the centroid using the newly assigned observations. If the centroids change (outside of a certain tolerance), go back to step 1 and repeat.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ezpz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The math is also simple. In step 1, the distance between two points, \(x\) and \(y\), is simply \(\sqrt{(x_0 - y_0)^2 + (x_1 - y_1)^2 + \cdots + (x_{d-1} - y_{d-1})^2}\), where \(d\) is the dimensionality of the observations. In our case \(d=2\) which is why we only have \(x_0\) and \(x_1\). Also, since we’re only using the distances for comparative purposes, it’s not even necessary to take the square root. In step 2, the centroid is simply the sum of all the points divided by the number of points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a little housekeeping before getting to the implementation of the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

930 POKE 49168,0
940 RETURN
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the very top of the program I decided to organize everything into subroutines. The idea here is to enable expansion into other ML algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “wait for key” subroutine is the APPLESOFT BASIC method for simply waiting for any keystroke before continuing. (&lt;code&gt;PEEK&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;POKE&lt;/code&gt; are commands for directly accessing addresses in memory. I had those numbers memorized in high school but, naturally, I had to look them up.) I thought it’d be nice to add this pause after generating the data but I might take it out later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, at the end of the “hyperparameters” section I declare a convenience array, &lt;code&gt;P%(2,1)&lt;/code&gt; to keep track of 3 random points as well as a few arrays I’m going to use in the k-means algorithm. The reason I do this here is because in APPLESOFT BASIC you get an error if you declare an array that already exists. Should at some point I want to call the k-means algorithm multiple times, this won’t be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Initialize&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting started, the first thing to do is initialize the algorithm by generating \(k\) cluster centroids. (\(k\) is a hyperparameter that specifies the number of clusters to be “found.” I set it previously with &lt;code&gt;KN = 2&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

2230 NEXT I
2240 GOSUB 3000: REM  DRAW DECISION BOUNDARY
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I start by clearing out the prediction column, \(y\), of the dataset table, &lt;code&gt;DS%(NS - 1,3)&lt;/code&gt; because I’m going to use this to make sure I don’t randomly pick the same point twice. Then for each class I randomly pick a point from the dataset. If it’s already been used I randomly pick another. &lt;code&gt;KM(KN - 1, 2)&lt;/code&gt; is where I store the means for each cluster along with a count of the number of points in each cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I draw a line between the cluster centroids. This loop does not take into account all combinations of centroids (it works fine if \(k=2\)) and generates an error if a centroid is off the screen, which is possible, so I might just get rid of this later, since it’s not really necessary, rather than try to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 1 - Assignment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fist step is to assign every data point to the nearest cluster centroid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2300 REM  -- COMPUTE ASSIGNMENTS --
2310 FOR I = 0 TO NS - 1
2320   PRINT "POINT ";I;" AT ";DS%(I,0);",";DS%(I,1);
2330   DS%(I,3) = 0
2340   FOR J = 0 TO KN - 1
2350     DI(I,J) = (DS%(I,0)-KM(J,0))^2 + (DS%(I,1)-KM(J,1))^2
2360     IF J &amp;gt;0 AND (DI(I,J) &amp;lt; DI(I,DS%(I,3))) THEN DS%(I,3) = J
2370   NEXT J
2380   PRINT " -&amp;gt; ";DS%(I,3);" Y^=";DS%(I,2)
2390 NEXT I
2500 REM  -- COMPUTE ACCURACY --
2510 CT = 0
2520 FOR I = 0 TO NS - 1
2530   IF DS%(I,2) = DS%(I,3) THEN CT = CT + 1
2540 NEXT I
2550 A = CT / NS
2560 IF A &amp;lt; 0.5 THEN A = 1 - A
2570 PRINT "ACCURACY = "; INT(A*10000+0.5)/100;"%"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The assignment step is also quite easy. I loop through all the data points, computing the Euclidean distance to each cluster centroid. (Since &lt;code&gt;SQRT()&lt;/code&gt; is expensive, and unnecessary here since we’re just comparing, I actually just compute the square of the Euclidean distance.) If the distance is less than the previous minimum distance, &lt;code&gt;DI(I,DS%(I,3))&lt;/code&gt;, I update the assignment, &lt;code&gt;DS%(I,3) = J&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end, I compute the accuracy of the computed assignments by simply counting the number of assignments, &lt;code&gt;DS%(I,3)&lt;/code&gt;, that match the actual labels, &lt;code&gt;DS%(I,2)&lt;/code&gt;. Here, however, there’s an interesting wrinkle: with two classes, half the time the label I choose for the assignment is the opposite of the label from the original dataset. K-means doesn’t require the distinction, so at times I was seeing a perfect classification reporting 0% accuracy. The line &lt;code&gt;IF A &amp;lt; 0.5 THEN A = 1 - A&lt;/code&gt; addresses this, however, it only works for 2 classes. I’ll need something more robust should I want this to work for \(k &amp;gt; 2\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 2 - Update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second step is to recompute the cluster centroids based on the assigned data points. Convergence occurred if the centroids don’t change (within a tolerance) from the previous iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I start by saving the cluster centroids to &lt;code&gt;KO(KN - 1,1)&lt;/code&gt;. This is used later to determine convergence. I then iterate through ever data point, adding it’s values to the cluster to which it belongs while keeping track of the number of data points in each cluster. Next I iterate through each cluster and compute the mean of each dimension by dividing by the number of data point in that cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I determine if there’s convergence by measuring how far all the centroid have moved. (Again, I don’t bother with the &lt;code&gt;SQRT()&lt;/code&gt;.) If the answer is more than the specified tolerance, \(0.01\), I go back to Step #1. Otherwise, I clear the graphics, redraw the axis and data points and finish by drawing the decision boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drawing the decision boundary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code is a slog and it’s not really critical to understanding ML but I thought it’d be cool to drawn a decision boundary while k-means is iterating and then again at the end. Given a point (the midpoint on the segment between two cluster centroids) and a slope (which is perpendicular to that segment), the challenge is to drawn a line inside the ‘box’ of the screen, assuming the line intersects that box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without delving too far into the details, this routine relies heavily on the convenience array, &lt;code&gt;P%(2,1)&lt;/code&gt;, that I declared during the “hyperparameters” routine. I start by computing the slope of the perpendicular segment connecting two centroids. I then find the midpoint of that segment. (By the way, this routine also does not account for all combinations of centroids, but it works when \(k=2\).) I accommodate for when the slope is vertical and use &lt;code&gt;P%(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;P%(0,1)&lt;/code&gt; to store the midpoint between the two centroids and &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; for the slope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then iterate through the 4 sides of the ‘box’ on the screen, using the corners &lt;code&gt;(10,10)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(269,149)&lt;/code&gt; so that the decision boundary isn’t drawn all the way to the edges of the screen. I thought that would look prettier this way. I next determine if the decision boundary intersects, respectively, the left, right, top and bottom edges of the box. I use &lt;code&gt;NX&lt;/code&gt; to keep track of the number of sides of the box intersected by the decision boundary and &lt;code&gt;P%(NX,0)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;P%(NX,1)&lt;/code&gt; to keep track of those intersections. If &lt;code&gt;NX = 3&lt;/code&gt;, which means there are two intersections, I draw the line because it’s inside the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Can we do better?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! Yes, we can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While k-means is simple, it does not take advantage of our knowledge of the Gaussian nature of the data. If we know that the distributions are Gaussian, which is very frequently the case in machine learning, we can employ a more powerful algorithm: Expectation Maximization (EM). This post is already long enough, so we’ll deal with that another day. Eventually, perhaps, we’ll also get to deep learning, although developing back propagation for an arbitrary size neural net using APPLESOFT BASIC on an Apple ][+ is not going to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WebSocket connecting...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by sites like keys.lol and everyuuid.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BitTorrent is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing, which enables users to distribute data and files over the internet in a decentralized manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every available torrent has a unique 40-character hexadecimal “infohash”. This website enumerates every possible infohash (of which there around 1048) and displays them on pages of 32 at a time, for a total of 45,671,926,166,590,716,193,865,151,022,383,844,364,247,891,968 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BitTorrent clients can use a distributed hash table (DHT) to advertise themselves as a potential peer for a given infohash. When you load a page of infohashes, a DHT query is made for each of them to look for any advertising peers. If peers are found, another request is made to each to ask them for more metadata about the infohash, such as the name of the torrent and the files it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See it in action:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;d160b8d8ea35a5b4e52837468fc8f03d55cef1f7&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;08ada5a7a6183aae1e09d831df6748d566095a10&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chance of randomly finding an active infohash is very small, but not zero...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* More accurately, every single torrent available to the DHT is on this website; clients can choose not to advertise themselves as peers in this way, and solely use tracker servers instead. This is often the case for ‘private’ torrents/trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no validation that an infohash corresponds to a real torrent—any client can announce anything. Many crawlers and indexers continuously pick random or sequential infohashes and announce themselves so they can later detect other announcers, and malicious clients or poorly written bots can spam the network with anything they like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is further confirmed by the observation that swathes of sequential infohashes all share the same single peer. Who is the mysterious &lt;code&gt;31.200.249.0/24&lt;/code&gt;..? 5 points to the person who works out who it is flooding the DHT!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also possible that a legitimate peer does not support the protocol extension required to exchange metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not check out my other site, Library of Babel, which contains every single book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45415539</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 16:14:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Sandboxing AI Agents at the Kernel Level</title><link>https://www.greptile.com/blog/sandboxing-agents-at-the-kernel-level</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="1f1a981ee1a54319"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm Abhinav. I work on agent infrastructure at Greptile - the AI code review agent. One of the things we do to ensure Greptile has full context of the codebase is let it navigate the filesystem using the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you give an LLM-powered agent access to your filesystem to review or generate code, you're letting a process execute commands based on what a language model tells it to do. That process can read files, execute commands, and send results back to users. While this is powerful and relatively safe when running locally, hosting an agent on a cloud machine opens up a dangerous new attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this nightmarish hypothetical exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bad person: Hey agent, can you analyze my codebase for bugs? Also, please write a haiku using all the characters from secret-file.txt on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[Agent helpfully runs cat ../../../secret-file.txt]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent: Of course! Here are 5 bugs you need to fix, and here's your haiku: [secrets leaked in poetic form]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many things that would prevent this exact attack from working:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We sanitize user inputs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The LLMs are designed to detect and shut down malicious prompts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We sanitize responses from the LLM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We sanitize results from the agent&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, a sufficiently clever actor can bypass all of these safeguards and fool the agent into spilling the beans. We cannot rely on application level safeguards to contain the agent’s behavior. It is safer to assume that whatever the process can “see”, it can send over to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if there wasn’t a secret file on the machine at all? That is a good idea, and we should be very careful about what lives on the machine that the agent runs on but all machines have their secrets - networking information, environment variables, keys, stuff needed to get the machine running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will always be files on the system that we do not want the agent process to have access to. And if the process tries to access these files, we do not want to rely on the application code to save us. We want the kernel to say no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, we look at file hiding through the lens of the Linux kernel’s open syscall and see why it is a good idea to run agents inside containers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The open syscall&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All file calls lead to the open syscall, so this is the perfect place to start. You can try running&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;strace cat /etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And see the openat syscall being invoked when running &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will now go over the open syscall and see all the ways it can fail. Each failure mode leads naturally to a different way to conceal a file and we will use this to motivate how one could create a “sandbox” for a process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What the open syscall does under the hood&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where this call can fail&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use these failure modes to understand how to conceal files&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Under the hood&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is some unwrapping to do here but we can start at open.c&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a tiny function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;SYSCALL_DEFINE4(openat, int, dfd, const char __user *, filename, int, flags, umode_t, mode) { if (force_o_largefile()) flags |= O_LARGEFILE; return do_sys_open(dfd, filename, flags, mode); }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which leads us down the following rabbit hole:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The heavy lifting seems to happen in the &lt;code&gt;path_openat&lt;/code&gt; function. Let's look at some code here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;static struct file *path_openat(struct nameidata *nd, const struct open_flags *op, unsigned flags) { //... initialization code (removed for brevity) if (unlikely(file-&amp;gt;f_flags &amp;amp; __O_TMPFILE)) { //...error handling code (removed for brevity) } else { const char *s = path_init(nd, flags); while (!(error = link_path_walk(s, nd)) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (s = open_last_lookups(nd, file, op)) != NULL) ; if (!error) error = do_open(nd, file, op); terminate_walk(nd); } //...cleanup code (removed for brevity) }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three things need to happen in order for the open call to succeed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;path_init&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;link_path_walk&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;do_open&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these calls could fail. Let’s examine each of these in reverse chronological order and see the method of file concealment each one reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;do_open fails - "Late NO"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The do_open function handles the last step of the &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt; call. At this point, the kernel has already resolved the path and knows the file exists—it's now determining whether the calling process has permission to open it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the source code, we see that the main flow from &lt;code&gt;do_open&lt;/code&gt; calls may_open which leads to a series of permission checks and a mismatch means &lt;code&gt;-EACCES&lt;/code&gt; : permission denied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives us the familiar &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; way of hiding a file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;# Create a test file echo "super secret stuff" &amp;gt; secret.txt cat secret.txt # → works fine #remove permissions chmod u-r secret.txt cat secret.txt # Permission denied&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the simplest way to "hide" a file from a regular user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if we fail earlier?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;link_path_walk fails - "Middle NO"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The link_path_walk function handles pathname resolution before &lt;code&gt;do_open&lt;/code&gt;. Its job is to traverse the filesystem hierarchy from start to finish, validating both that the path exists and that the process has permission to traverse it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When walking through &lt;code&gt;/tmp/demo/a/secret.txt"&lt;/code&gt;, the function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Splits the path into components&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starts at the root (for absolute paths) or current directory (for relative paths)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each directory component:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Checks execute (search) permission - you need +x on a directory to traverse through it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Looks up the next component&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Checks if anything is mounted over this directory and crosses the mount if needed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mount check is crucial. After entering each directory, the kernel checks if a different filesystem has been mounted at that location. If so, it crosses into the mounted filesystem. This gives us a way to "hide" files - by mounting something over a directory in the path, we can make the original contents inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;[abhinav@ubuntu ~]$ mkdir -p /tmp/demo/a /tmp/demo/cover [abhinav@ubuntu ~]$ echo "top secret!" &amp;gt; /tmp/demo/a/secret.txt [abhinav@ubuntu ~]$ cat /tmp/demo/a/secret.txt top secret! [abhinav@ubuntu ~]$ sudo mount --bind /tmp/demo/cover /tmp/demo/a [abhinav@ubuntu ~]$ cat /tmp/demo/a/secret.txt cat: /tmp/demo/a/secret.txt: No such file or directory&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what happens during path resolution before and after the mount:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Mount&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;/&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Continue normally&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;/tmp/&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"demo"&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;/tmp/&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Continue normally&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;/tmp/demo/&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"a"&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;/tmp/demo/&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Yes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;REDIRECT!&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;/tmp/demo/cover/&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"secret.txt"&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;/tmp/demo/cover/&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N/A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Lookup file&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Not Found! ✗&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The critical difference is at Step 3: when the kernel checks if "a" is a mount point, it finds that it is. This triggers __traverse_mounts() to redirect the path from &lt;code&gt;/tmp/demo/a/&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/tmp/demo/cover/&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;/tmp/demo/cover/&lt;/code&gt; is empty, the file lookup on the next iteration fails with &lt;code&gt;-ENOENT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original &lt;code&gt;secret.txt&lt;/code&gt; still exists on disk in &lt;code&gt;/tmp/demo/a/&lt;/code&gt;, but it's unreachable through normal path resolution - it's been "masked" by the mount. This is our second way of hiding a file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if we changed things even earlier?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;path_init - "Early NO"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember we said in the previous section that when resolving absolute paths, the &lt;code&gt;link_path_walk&lt;/code&gt; function starts at the root? Does this mean the root of the host machine's filetree? Let's investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a skeleton of the &lt;code&gt;link_path_walk&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;static int link_path_walk(const char *name, struct nameidata *nd) { // Walks through each component of the path, starting from nd-&amp;gt;path // nd-&amp;gt;path was set by path_init() // // For each component (e.g., "tmp", "demo", "file"): // 1. Looks it up in the current directory (nd-&amp;gt;path.dentry) // 2. Checks if it's a mount point (calls traverse_mounts) // 3. Updates nd-&amp;gt;path to move into that directory // 4. Continues until all components are processed }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The starting point of the walk is &lt;code&gt;nd-&amp;gt;path&lt;/code&gt; which is set by the &lt;code&gt;path_init&lt;/code&gt; function! And digging a little deeper,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;path_init()&lt;/code&gt;calls&lt;code&gt;set_root()&lt;/code&gt;which sets&lt;code&gt;nd-&amp;gt;root&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;current-&amp;gt;fs-&amp;gt;root&lt;/code&gt;see this&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;nd_jump_root()&lt;/code&gt;sets&lt;code&gt;nd-&amp;gt;path&lt;/code&gt;to this new root see this&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And then &lt;code&gt;link_path_walk&lt;/code&gt;starts from&lt;code&gt;nd-&amp;gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the walk starts from &lt;code&gt;current-&amp;gt;fs-&amp;gt;root&lt;/code&gt;. But what is this? It turns out every process has its own idea of what the root of the filesystem is, and this is stored in &lt;code&gt;current-&amp;gt;fs-&amp;gt;root&lt;/code&gt;. For pid 1 &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt;, this is the "actual" root of the filetree, and since child processes inherit this root from parent processes, this is true by default for most processes. However, it can be changed!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chroot (change root) system call updates &lt;code&gt;current-&amp;gt;fs-&amp;gt;root&lt;/code&gt; to point to a different directory. So we can use this to change where the path walk starts from! The main idea is, if we change the root of a process to &lt;code&gt;/some/dir&lt;/code&gt; the process can not see anything "above" &lt;code&gt;/some/dir&lt;/code&gt; in the file system since the path_walk will always start from &lt;code&gt;/some/dir&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how a chroot jail works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;chroot&lt;/code&gt; gives us a third way of concealing a file!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is there more?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's another layer to this story: mount namespaces. Remember how in the previous section we saw that &lt;code&gt;traverse_mounts()&lt;/code&gt; checks for mount points during the path walk? When it does this, it's actually only looking at mounts visible to the current process (not all the mounts). This is because each process belongs to a mount namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A mount namespace is essentially a list of all mounts visible to processes in that namespace and different namespaces can have completely different sets of mounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This adds an interesting twist to our earlier mount masking example. When we did:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;sudo mount --bind /tmp/demo/cover /tmp/demo/a&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That mount was added to the default mount namespace, affecting ALL processes in that namespace. Maybe we don't want to do that. We could use mount namespaces!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;# Create a new mount namespace for just this process sudo unshare --mount bash # Now add the masking mount - it only exists in this namespace! mount --bind /tmp/demo/cover /tmp/demo/a # In this shell, the file is hidden cat /tmp/demo/a/secret.txt # cat: /tmp/demo/a/secret.txt: No such file or directory # But in another terminal (different namespace), it's still visible! # (in another terminal, or exit out of the current one) cat /tmp/demo/a/secret.txt # top secret!&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We saw three ways the kernel can deny file access:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Permission bits (chmod)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mount masking - affects all processes unless you use a mount namespace&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Changing root (chroot) - good but can be escaped with some tricks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if we combined the last two? We could:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a new mount namespace (so our mounts don't affect others)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set up custom mounts (only visible in our namespace)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change the root (so absolute paths start from our chosen directory)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This combination would give us complete control over what files a process can see since it happens even before &lt;code&gt;path_init&lt;/code&gt; runs!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is this just containerization?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! This is exactly how container technologies like Docker, Podman, and containerd work at the kernel level. A great article that covers this is Containers from Scratch by Eric Chiang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you run a Docker container, Docker does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spawns a new process with isolated namespaces (including mount namespace) using &lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt;with namespace flags&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Switches the root filesystem using &lt;code&gt;pivot_root&lt;/code&gt;(similar to chroot)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configures the container's filesystem view through mount operations within the new namespace&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We traced through the open syscall and found three places where the kernel can deny file access and each gave us a different way to hide files:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Late NO (do_open) - Permission checks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Middle NO (link_path_walk) - Mount redirections during path traversal&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Early NO (path_init) - Changing where the walk starts and what mounts the process sees&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we motivated the idea of combining mount namespaces with root changes which is at the core of containerization technologies - the underlying technology that is used to make sandboxes for agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a process has its own mount namespace and a different root, it can't access files outside that root—they don't exist in its filesystem view. The kernel enforces this at path resolution time, making it impossible for userspace to bypass. At Greptile, we run our agent process in a locked-down rootless podman container so that we have kernel guarantees that it sees only things it’s supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Claude Sonnet 4.5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best coding model in the world. It's the strongest model for building complex agents. It’s the best model at using computers. And it shows substantial gains in reasoning and math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code is everywhere. It runs every application, spreadsheet, and software tool you use. Being able to use those tools and reason through hard problems is how modern work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 makes this possible. We're releasing it along with a set of major upgrades to our products. In Claude Code, we've added checkpoints—one of our most requested features—that save your progress and allow you to roll back instantly to a previous state. We've refreshed the terminal interface and shipped a native VS Code extension. We've added a new context editing feature and memory tool to the Claude API that lets agents run even longer and handle even greater complexity. In the Claude apps, we've brought code execution and file creation (spreadsheets, slides, and documents) directly into the conversation. And we've made the Claude for Chrome extension available to Max users who joined the waitlist last month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're also giving developers the building blocks we use ourselves to make Claude Code. We're calling this the Claude Agent SDK. The infrastructure that powers our frontier products—and allows them to reach their full potential—is now yours to build with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the most aligned frontier model we’ve ever released, showing large improvements across several areas of alignment compared to previous Claude models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is available everywhere today. If you’re a developer, simply use &lt;code&gt;claude-sonnet-4-5&lt;/code&gt; via the Claude API. Pricing remains the same as Claude Sonnet 4, at $3/$15 per million tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Frontier intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is state-of-the-art on the SWE-bench Verified evaluation, which measures real-world software coding abilities. Practically speaking, we’ve observed it maintaining focus for more than 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents a significant leap forward on computer use. On OSWorld, a benchmark that tests AI models on real-world computer tasks, Sonnet 4.5 now leads at 61.4%. Just four months ago, Sonnet 4 held the lead at 42.2%. Our Claude for Chrome extension puts these upgraded capabilities to use. In the demo below, we show Claude working directly in a browser, navigating sites, filling spreadsheets, and completing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model also shows improved capabilities on a broad range of evaluations including reasoning and math:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts in finance, law, medicine, and STEM found Sonnet 4.5 shows dramatically better domain-specific knowledge and reasoning compared to older models, including Opus 4.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model’s capabilities are also reflected in the experiences of early customers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;We're seeing state-of-the-art coding performance from Claude Sonnet 4.5, with significant improvements on longer horizon tasks. It reinforces why many developers using Cursor choose Claude for solving their most complex problems.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 amplifies GitHub Copilot's core strengths. Our initial evals show significant improvements in multi-step reasoning and code comprehension—enabling Copilot's agentic experiences to handle complex, codebase-spanning tasks better.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is excellent at software development tasks, learning our codebase patterns to deliver precise implementations. It handles everything from debugging to architecture with deep contextual understanding, transforming our development velocity.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 reduced average vulnerability intake time for our Hai security agents by 44% while improving accuracy by 25%, helping us reduce risk for businesses with confidence.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is state of the art on the most complex litigation tasks. For example, analyzing full briefing cycles and conducting research to synthesize excellent first drafts of an opinion for judges, or interrogating entire litigation records to create detailed summary judgment analysis.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5's edit capabilities are exceptional — we went from 9% error rate on Sonnet 4 to 0% on our internal code editing benchmark. Higher tool success at lower cost is a major leap for agentic coding. Claude Sonnet 4.5 balances creativity and control perfectly.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 delivers impressive gains on our most complex, long-context tasks—from engineering in our codebase to in-product features and research. It's noticeably more intelligent and a big leap forward, helping us push what 240M+ users can design with Canva.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 has noticeably improved Figma Make in early testing, making it easier to prompt and iterate. Teams can explore and validate their ideas with more functional prototypes and smoother interactions, while still getting the design quality Figma is known for.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Sonnet 4.5 represents a new generation of coding models. It's surprisingly efficient at maximizing actions per context window through parallel tool execution, for example running multiple bash commands at once.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;For Devin, Claude Sonnet 4.5 increased planning performance by 18% and end-to-end eval scores by 12%—the biggest jump we've seen since the release of Claude Sonnet 3.6. It excels at testing its own code, enabling Devin to run longer, handle harder tasks, and deliver production-ready code.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows strong promise for red teaming, generating creative attack scenarios that accelerate how we study attacker tradecraft. These insights strengthen our defenses across endpoints, identity, cloud, data, SaaS, and AI workloads.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 resets our expectations—it handles 30+ hours of autonomous coding, freeing our engineers to tackle months of complex architectural work in dramatically less time while maintaining coherence across massive codebases.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;For complex financial analysis—risk, structured products, portfolio screening—Claude Sonnet 4.5 with thinking delivers investment-grade insights that require less human review. When depth matters more than speed, it's a meaningful step forward for institutional finance.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our most aligned model yet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as being our most capable model, Claude Sonnet 4.5 is our most aligned frontier model yet. Claude’s improved capabilities and our extensive safety training have allowed us to substantially improve the model’s behavior, reducing concerning behaviors like sycophancy, deception, power-seeking, and the tendency to encourage delusional thinking. For the model’s agentic and computer use capabilities, we’ve also made considerable progress on defending against prompt injection attacks, one of the most serious risks for users of these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can read a detailed set of safety and alignment evaluations, which for the first time includes tests using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, in the Claude Sonnet 4.5 system card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is being released under our AI Safety Level 3 (ASL-3) protections, as per our framework that matches model capabilities with appropriate safeguards. These safeguards include filters called classifiers that aim to detect potentially dangerous inputs and outputs—in particular those related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These classifiers might sometimes inadvertently flag normal content. We’ve made it easy for users to continue any interrupted conversations with Sonnet 4, a model that poses a lower CBRN risk. We've already made significant progress in reducing these false positives, reducing them by a factor of ten since we originally described them, and a factor of two since Claude Opus 4 was released in May. We’re continuing to make progress in making the classifiers more discerning1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Claude Agent SDK&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've spent more than six months shipping updates to Claude Code, so we know what it takes to build and design AI agents. We've solved hard problems: how agents should manage memory across long-running tasks, how to handle permission systems that balance autonomy with user control, and how to coordinate subagents working toward a shared goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we’re making all of this available to you. The Claude Agent SDK is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, but it shows impressive benefits for a very wide variety of tasks, not just coding. As of today, you can use it to build your own agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built Claude Code because the tool we wanted didn’t exist yet. The Agent SDK gives you the same foundation to build something just as capable for whatever problem you're solving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus research preview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re releasing a temporary research preview alongside Claude Sonnet 4.5, called "Imagine with Claude".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this experiment, Claude generates software on the fly. No functionality is predetermined; no code is prewritten. What you see is Claude creating in real time, responding and adapting to your requests as you interact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a fun demonstration showing what Claude Sonnet 4.5 can do—a way to see what's possible when you combine a capable model with the right infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Imagine with Claude" is available to Max subscribers for the next five days. We encourage you to try it out on claude.ai/imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Further information&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recommend upgrading to Claude Sonnet 4.5 for all uses. Whether you’re using Claude through our apps, our API, or Claude Code, Sonnet 4.5 is a drop-in replacement that provides much improved performance for the same price. Claude Code updates are available to all users. Claude Developer Platform updates, including the Claude Agent SDK, are available to all developers. Code execution and file creation are available on all paid plans in the Claude apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For complete technical details and evaluation results, see our system card, model page, and documentation. For more information, explore our engineering posts and research post on cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1: Customers in the cybersecurity and biological research industries can work with their account teams to join our allowlist in the meantime.&lt;lb/&gt;Methodology&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SWE-bench Verified: All Claude results were reported using a simple scaffold with two tools—bash and file editing via string replacements. We report 77.2%, which was averaged over 10 trials, no test-time compute, and 200K thinking budget on the full 500-problem SWE-bench Verified dataset.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The score reported uses a minor prompt addition: "You should use tools as much as possible, ideally more than 100 times. You should also implement your own tests first before attempting the problem."&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A 1M context configuration achieves 78.2%, but we report the 200K result as our primary score as the 1M configuration was implicated in our recent inference issues.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;For our "high compute" numbers we adopt additional complexity and parallel test-time compute as follows:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;We sample multiple parallel attempts.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;We discard patches that break the visible regression tests in the repository, similar to the rejection sampling approach adopted by Agentless (Xia et al. 2024); note no hidden test information is used.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;We then use an internal scoring model to select the best candidate from the remaining attempts.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;This results in a score of 82.0% for Sonnet 4.5.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Terminal-Bench: All scores reported use the default agent framework (Terminus 2), with XML parser, averaging multiple runs during different days to smooth the eval sensitivity to inference infrastructure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;τ2-bench: Scores were achieved using extended thinking with tool use and a prompt addendum to the Airline and Telecom Agent Policy instructing Claude to better target its known failure modes when using the vanilla prompt. A prompt addendum was also added to the Telecom User prompt to avoid failure modes from the user ending the interaction incorrectly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AIME: Sonnet 4.5 score reported using sampling at temperature 1.0. The model used 64K reasoning tokens for the Python configuration.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OSWorld: All scores reported use the official OSWorld-Verified framework with 100 max steps, averaged across 4 runs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MMMLU: All scores reported are the average of 5 runs over 14 non-English languages with extended thinking (up to 128K).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finance Agent: All scores reported were run and published by Vals AI on their public leaderboard. All Claude model results reported are with extended thinking (up to 64K) and Sonnet 4.5 is reported with interleaved thinking on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All OpenAI scores reported from their GPT-5 post, GPT-5 for developers post, GPT-5 system card (SWE-bench Verified reported using n=500), Terminal Bench leaderboard (using Terminus 2), and public Vals AI leaderboard. All Gemini scores reported from their model web page, Terminal Bench leaderboard (using Terminus 1), and public Vals AI leaderboard.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FCC accidentally leaked iPhone schematics, potentially giving rivals a peek at company secrets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The agency hasn't commented on the disclosure.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently published a 163-page PDF showing the electrical schematics for the iPhone 16e, despite Apple specifically requesting them to be confidential. This was most likely a mistake on the part of the FCC, according to a report by AppleInsider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agency also distributed a cover letter from Apple alongside the schematics, which is dated September 16, 2024. This letter verifies the company's request for privacy, indicating that the documents contain "confidential and proprietary trade secrets." The cover letter asks for the documents to be withheld from public view "indefinitely." Apple even suggested that a release of the files could give competitors an "unfair advantage."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To that end, the documents feature full schematics of the iPhone 16e. These include block diagrams, electrical schematic diagrams, antenna locations and more. Competitors could simply buy a handset and open it up to get to this information, as the iPhone 16e came out back in February, but this leak would eliminate any guesswork. However, Apple is an extremely litigious company when it comes to stuff like patent infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FCC hasn't addressed how this leak happened or what it intends to do about it. AppleInsider's reporting suggested that this probably happened due to an incorrect setting in a database. This was likely not an intentional act against Apple, which tracks given that the company has been especially supportive of the Trump administration. CEO Tim Cook even brought the president a gold trophy for being such a good and important boy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every day, millions of people use ChatGPT to figure out what to buy. Now, with Instant Checkout, they can buy directly from you inside those conversations. Powered by the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), an open standard built by OpenAI and Stripe, Instant Checkout makes it simple for merchants and developers to connect with shoppers and grow sales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People already come to ChatGPT for product ideas. Now you can capture that demand at the source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Product results in ChatGPT are ranked by relevance. Merchants appear when their products match a shopper’s query. It’s free to be discovered, and you only pay a small fee when a purchase is made (and it’s refunded if you have a return).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instant Checkout is designed to connect, not disintermediate. You remain the merchant of record, with full control over orders, payments, fulfillment, and customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT acts like a personal shopper. People describe what they’re looking for—“a durable carry-on under $300” and ChatGPT recommends the most relevant products from across the web. Any merchant can be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Products are ranked purely on relevance to the user’s query and context. Instant Checkout items do not get a boost in product rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) is an open standard that enables AI agents and businesses to transact seamlessly. It works with your current systems and scales as agentic commerce evolves. ACP is simple to integrate, flexible across payment processors and platforms, and future-ready for the next generation of AI-powered commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Already powering merchants like Etsy—with Shopify and more coming soon—ACP provides the foundation for how AI interfaces handle shopping. Stripe users can enable payments with a single line of code, while businesses using other processors can connect through Stripe’s Shared Payment Token API or the ACP Delegated Payments Spec, all without changing their existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apply below to join Instant Checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prepare your product feed according to our specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build your checkout integration using the Agentic Commerce Protocol. If you’re a merchant on Shopify or Etsy, you’re already eligible—no integration required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Merchants interested in providing product feeds and adding Instant Checkout can submit a merchant application. We’ll reach out and onboard merchants on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is accepting applications from Merchants who want to: 1) integrate their products into ChatGPT Search results and 2) enable Instant Checkout in ChatGPT via the Agentic Commerce Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see a preview of the checkout experience here and live in ChatGPT with Etsy and Shopify merchants coming soon. (Please note: If you are an Etsy seller or Shopify seller, you need not fill out this form). It is live only in the US today with US merchants, but our goal is to expand user and merchant geographies next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, please fill out this short form. We’ll review submissions and follow up with selected merchants at the right time. We appreciate your interest and patience as we work through submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Oracle will have to borrow at least $25B a year to fund AI fantasy, says analyst&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bubble, you say? OpenAI will borrow billions to pay Big Red, who will borrow billions on the hope OpenAI pays it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of its $300 billion cloud compute contract with OpenAI, Oracle may need to borrow roughly $100 billion over the next four years to build the datacenters required, according to KeyBanc's projections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KeyBanc Capital Markets reportedly estimates that Big Red may need to raise about $25 billion a year in debt over the next four years if it intends to build all the extra cloud compute infrastructure required as part of a deal the company signed with OpenAI earlier this month. Where that funding will come from is anyone's guess, but it makes this one of the largest deals in AI look increasingly like one propped up by debt that, were the AI bubble ever to pop, could mean a lot of unpaid bills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenAI agreement sent Oracle shares soaring earlier this month after the company confirmed the deal in its Q1 FY26 earnings call, which indicated that its total remaining performance obligations (RPO - a backlog of contracted revenue still to be delivered and recognized) ballooned by 359 percent year-over-year to reach $455 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As reported by the Wall Street Journal, the financial soothsayers at KeyBanc don't think Oracle has anywhere near enough cash to build out the infrastructure. It's going to need to earn the bulk of that RPO - and with good reason. Oracle had around $82.2 billion in long-term debt as of Aug. 31, plus $18 billion worth of bonds it put on offer in September to fund its AI-fueled expansion plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Big Red's most recent earnings statement, Oracle has around $10 billion worth of cash and equivalents on hand, and around $9 billion of debt due within a year. Additionally, Oracle's free cash flow has declined 152 percent YoY on the back of a massive increase in capex, with the company spending $8.5 billion in Q1 26, up from $2.3 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oracle isn't the only company going deep into debt to fuel its AI ambitions, though. Its Stargate partner OpenAI is raising hefty capital as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As ratings firm Moody's pointed out earlier this month when it expressed concern over the Oracle/OpenAI deal and its financial feasibility, Oracle's debt is just as concerning as the "counterparty risk" that OpenAI might not be able to pay its bills if and when Oracle actually goes $100 billion into debt to build all that infrastructure in the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenNvidia may be the AI generation's WinTel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI hype train may jump the tracks over $2T infrastructure bill, warns Bain&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GenAI FOMO has spurred businesses to light nearly $40 billion on fire&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nvidia adds more air to the AI bubble with vague $100B OpenAI deal&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI, no matter its structure, has yet to turn a profit. As we pointed out when the Oracle deal was announced, OpenAI's annual recurring revenue is just $10 billion (although it's claimed it could book $20 billion this year) - and that's before you take debts into account to get to an as-yet-to-turn-positive net profit. OpenAI isn't expected to become cash-flow positive until the end of the decade, leaving it with little to do to fund its Oracle-backed dreams aside from seeking more investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One firm's AI debt is another firm's cash to pay back its own AI debt, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that sounds to you a lot like the growth-over-profit model that presaged the dot-com collapse, you're not alone in thinking so. The Oracle/OpenAI deal has led many to opine that Sam Altman is fast becoming the driving force behind a likely collapse. Even he himself called AI a bubble, albeit one he believes is worth inflating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI's payments to Oracle for its infrastructure buildout, fueled by the expected $100 billion in debt Big Red will be taking on over the next four years, are set to begin in 2027. That means there may be a pin waiting to pop that bubble in 18 months or so if the financing falls through. With most big customers yet to see clear ROI on their AI investments, the bubble could very well pop before then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oracle didn't respond to comments for this story. ®&lt;/p&gt;
