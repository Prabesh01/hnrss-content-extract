    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Inside the Kimsuky Leak: How the “Kim” Dump Exposed North Korea’s Credential Theft Playbook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contents:&lt;lb/&gt;Part I: Technical Analysis&lt;lb/&gt;Part II: Goals Analysis&lt;lb/&gt;Part III: Threat Intelligence Report&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A rare and revealing breach attributed to a North Korean-affiliated actor, known only as “Kim” as named by the hackers who dumped the data, has delivered a new insight into Kimsuky (APT43) tactics, techniques, and infrastructure. This actor’s operational profile showcases credential-focused intrusions targeting South Korean and Taiwanese networks, with a blending of Chinese-language tooling, infrastructure, and possible logistical support. The “Kim” dump, which includes bash histories, phishing domains, OCR workflows, compiled stagers, and rootkit evidence, reflects a hybrid operation situated between DPRK attribution and Chinese resource utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This report is broken down into three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technical Analysis of the dump materials&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Motivation and Goals of the APT actor (group)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A CTI report compartment for analysts&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this leak only gives a partial idea of what the Kimusky/PRC activities have been, the material provides insight into the expansion of activities, nature of the actor(s), and goals they have in their penetration of the South Korean governmental systems that would benefit not only DPRK, but also PRC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, there will be more coming out from this dump in the future, particularly if the burned assets have not been taken offline and access is still available, or if others have cloned those assets for further analysis. We may revisit this in the future if additional novel information comes to light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Part I: Technical Analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Leak at a Glance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leaked dataset attributed to the “Kim” operator offers a uniquely operational perspective into North Korean-aligned cyber operations. Among the contents were terminal history files revealing active malware development efforts using NASM (Netwide Assembler), a choice consistent with low-level shellcode engineering typically reserved for custom loaders and injection tools. These logs were not static forensic artifacts but active command-line histories showing iterative compilation and cleanup processes, suggesting a hands-on attacker directly involved in tool assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In parallel, the operator ran OCR (Optical Character Recognition) commands against sensitive Korean PDF documents related to public key infrastructure (PKI) standards and VPN deployments. These actions likely aimed to extract structured language or configurations for use in spoofing, credential forgery, or internal tool emulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privileged Access Management (PAM) logs also surfaced in the dump, detailing a timeline of password changes and administrative account use. Many were tagged with the Korean string 변경완료 (“change complete”), and the logs included repeated references to elevated accounts such as oracle, svradmin, and app_adm01, indicating sustained access to critical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phishing infrastructure was extensive. Domain telemetry pointed to a network of malicious sites designed to mimic legitimate Korean government portals. Sites like nid-security[.]com were crafted to fool users into handing over credentials via advanced AiTM (Adversary-in-the-Middle) techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, network artifacts within the dump showed targeted reconnaissance of Taiwanese government and academic institutions. Specific IP addresses and .tw domain access, along with attempts to crawl .git repositories, reveal a deliberate focus on high-value administrative and developer targets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps most concerning was the inclusion of a Linux rootkit using syscall hooking (khook) and stealth persistence via directories like /usr/lib64/tracker-fs. This highlights a capability for deep system compromise and covert command-and-control operations, far beyond phishing and data theft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Artifacts recovered from the dump include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Terminal history files demonstrating malware compilation using NASM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OCR commands parsing Korean PDF documents related to PKI and VPN infrastructure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PAM logs reflecting password changes and credential lifecycle events&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Phishing infrastructure mimicking Korean government sites&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IP addresses indicating reconnaissance of Taiwanese government and research institutions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux rootkit code using syscall hooking and covert channel deployment&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Credential Theft Focus&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dump strongly emphasizes credential harvesting as a central operational goal. Key files such as 136백운규001_env.key (The presence of 136백운규001_env.key is a smoking gun indicator of stolen South Korean Government PKI material, as its structure (numeric ID + Korean name + .key) aligns uniquely with SK GPKI issuance practices and provides clear evidence of compromised, identity-tied state cryptographic keys.) This was discovered alongside plaintext passwords, that indicate clear evidence of active compromise of South Korea’s GPKI (Government Public Key Infrastructure). Possession of such certificates would allow for highly effective identity spoofing across government systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PAM logs further confirmed this focus, showing a pattern of administrative account rotation and password resets, all timestamped and labeled with success indicators (변경완료: Change Complete). The accounts affected were not low-privilege; instead, usernames like oracle, svradmin, and app_adm01, often used by IT staff and infrastructure services, suggested access to core backend environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These findings point to a strategy centered on capturing and maintaining access to privileged credentials and digital certificates, effectively allowing the attacker to act as an insider within trusted systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Leaked .key files (e.g., 136백운규001_env.key) with plaintext passwords confirm access to GPKI systems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PAM logs show administrative password rotations tagged with 변경완료 (change complete)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Admin-level accounts such as oracle, svradmin, and app_adm01 repeatedly appear in compromised logs&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Phishing Infrastructure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The operator’s phishing infrastructure was both expansive and regionally tailored. Domains such as nid-security[.]com and webcloud-notice[.]com mimicked Korean identity and document delivery services, likely designed to intercept user logins or deploy malicious payloads. More sophisticated spoofing was seen in sites that emulated official government agencies like dcc.mil[.]kr, spo.go[.]kr, and mofa.go[.]kr.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Burner email usage added another layer of operational tradecraft. The address jeder97271[@]wuzak[.]com is likely linked to phishing kits that operated through TLS proxies, capturing credentials in real time as victims interacted with spoofed login forms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tactics align with previously known Kimsuky behaviors but also demonstrate an evolution in technical implementation, particularly the use of AiTM interception rather than relying solely on credential-harvesting documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Domains include: nid-security[.]com, html-load[.]com, webcloud-notice[.]com, koala-app[.]com, and wuzak[.]com&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mimicked portals: dcc.mil[.]kr, spo.go[.]kr, mofa.go[.]kr&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Burner email evidence: jeder97271[@]wuzak[.]com&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Phishing kits leveraged TLS proxies for AiTM credential capture&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Malware Development Activity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim’s malware development environment showcased a highly manual, tailored approach. Shellcode was compiled using NASM, specifically with flags like -f win32, revealing a focus on targeting Windows environments. Commands such as make and rm were used to automate and sanitize builds, while hashed API call resolution (VirtualAlloc, HttpSendRequestA, etc.) was implemented to evade antivirus heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dump also revealed reliance on GitHub repositories known for offensive tooling. TitanLdr, minbeacon, Blacklotus, and CobaltStrike-Auto-Keystore were all cloned or referenced in command logs. This hybrid use of public frameworks for private malware assembly is consistent with modern APT workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A notable technical indicator was the use of the proxyres library to extract Windows proxy settings, particularly via functions like proxy_config_win_get_auto_config_url. This suggests an interest in hijacking or bypassing network-level security controls within enterprise environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manual shellcode compilation via nasm -f win32 source/asm/x86/start.asm&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use of make, rm, and hash obfuscation of Win32 API calls (e.g., VirtualAlloc, HttpSendRequestA)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GitHub tools in use: TitanLdr, minbeacon, Blacklotus, CobaltStrike-Auto-Keystore&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proxy configuration probing through proxyres library (proxy_config_win_get_auto_config_url)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rootkit Toolkit and Implant Structure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kim dump offers deep insight into a stealthy and modular Linux rootkit attributed to the operator’s post-compromise persistence tactics. The core implant, identified as vmmisc.ko (alternatively VMmisc.ko in some shells), was designed for kernel-mode deployment across multiple x86_64 Linux distributions and utilizes classic syscall hooking and covert channeling to maintain long-term undetected access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Google Translation of Koh doc: Rootkit Endpoint Reuse Authentication Tool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This tool uses kernel-level rootkit hiding technology, providing a high degree of stealth and penetration connection capability. It can hide while running on common Linux systems, and at the kernel layer supports connection forwarding, allowing reuse of external ports to connect to controlled hosts. Its communication behavior is hidden within normal traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tool uses binary merging technology: at compile time, the application layer program is encrypted and fused into a .ko driver file. When installed, only the .ko file exists. When the .ko driver starts, it will automatically decompress and release the hidden application-layer program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools like chkrootkit, rkhunter, and management utilities (such as ps, netstat, etc.) are bypassed through technical evasion and hiding, making them unable to detect hidden networks, ports, processes, or file information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ensure software stability, all functions have also passed stress testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supported systems: Linux Kernel 2.6.x / 3.x / 4.x, both x32 and x64 systems”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implant Features and Behavior&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This rootkit exhibits several advanced features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Syscall Hooking: Hooks critical kernel functions (e.g., getdents, read, write) to hide files, directories, and processes by name or PID.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SOCKS5 Proxy: Integrated remote networking capability using dynamic port forwarding and chained routing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PTY Backdoor Shell: Spawns pseudoterminals that operate as interactive reverse shells with password protection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encrypted Sessions: Session commands must match a pre-set passphrase (e.g., testtest) to activate rootkit control mode.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once installed (typically using insmod vmmisc.ko), the rootkit listens silently and allows manipulation via an associated client binary found in the dump. The client supports an extensive set of interactive commands, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;+p # list hidden processes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;+f # list hidden files&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;callrk # load client ↔ kernel handshake&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;exitrk # gracefully unload implant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;shell # spawn reverse shell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;socks5 # initiate proxy channel&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;upload / download # file transfer interface&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These capabilities align closely with known DPRK malware behaviors, particularly from the Kimsuky and Lazarus groups, who have historically leveraged rootkits for lateral movement, stealth, persistence, and exfiltration staging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Observed Deployment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminal history (.bash_history) shows the implant was staged and tested from the following paths:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.cache/vmware/drag_and_drop/VMmisc.ko

/usr/lib64/tracker-fs/vmmisc.ko

Execution logs show the use of commands such as:

insmod /usr/lib64/tracker-fs/vmmisc.ko

./client 192.168.0[.]39 testtest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These paths were not random—they mimic legitimate system service locations to avoid detection by file integrity monitoring (FIM) tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This structure highlights the modular, command-activated nature of the implant and its ability to serve multiple post-exploitation roles while maintaining stealth through kernel-layer masking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Strategic Implications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The presence of such an advanced toolkit in the “Kim” dump strongly suggests the actor had persistent access to Linux server environments, likely via credential compromise. The use of kernel-mode implants also indicates long-term intent and trust-based privilege escalation. The implant’s pathing, language patterns, and tactics (e.g., use of /tracker-fs/, use of test passwords) match TTPs previously observed in operations attributed to Kimsuky, enhancing confidence in North Korean origin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OCR-Based Recon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A defining component of Kim’s tradecraft was the use of OCR to analyze Korean-language security documentation. The attacker issued commands such as ocrmypdf -l kor+eng “file.pdf” to parse documents like 별지2)행정전자서명_기술요건_141125.pdf (“Appendix 2: Administrative Electronic Signature_Technical Requirements_141125.pdf”) and SecuwaySSL U_카달로그.pdf (“SecuwaySSL U_Catalog.pdf”). These files contain technical language around digital signatures, SSL implementations, and identity verification standards used in South Korea’s PKI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This OCR-based collection approach indicates more than passive intelligence gathering – it reflects a deliberate effort to model and potentially clone government-grade authentication systems. The use of bilingual OCR (Korean + English) further confirms the operator’s intention to extract usable configuration data across documentation types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OCR commands used to extract Korean PKI policy language from PDFs such as (별지2)행정전자서명_기술요건_141125.pdf and SecuwaySSL U_카달로그.pdf &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;별지2)행정전자서명_기술요건_141125.pdf → (Appendix 2: Administrative Electronic Signature_Technical Requirements_141125.pdf&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;SecuwaySSL U_카달로그.pdf → SecuwaySSL U_Catalog.pdf&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Command examples: ocrmypdf -l kor+eng “file.pdf”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SSH and Log-Based Evidence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The forensic evidence contained within the logs, specifically SSH authentication records and PAM outputs, provides clear technical confirmation of the operator’s tactics and target focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several IP addresses stood out as sources of brute-force login attempts. These include 23.95.213[.]210 (a known VPS provider used in past credential-stuffing campaigns), 218.92.0[.]210 (allocated to a Chinese ISP), and 122.114.233[.]77 (Henan Mobile, China). These IPs were recorded during multiple failed login events, strongly suggesting automated password attacks against exposed SSH services. Their geographic distribution and known history in malicious infrastructure usage point to an external staging environment, possibly used for pivoting into Korean and Taiwanese systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond brute force, the logs also contain evidence of authentication infrastructure reconnaissance. Multiple PAM and OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) errors referenced South Korea’s national PKI authority, including domains like gva.gpki.go[.]kr and ivs.gpki.go[.]kr. These errors appear during scripted or automated access attempts, indicating a potential strategy of credential replay or certificate misuse against GPKI endpoints, an approach that aligns with Kim’s broader PKI-targeting operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most revealing detail was the presence of successful superuser logins labeled with the Korean term 최고 관리자 (“Super Administrator”). This suggests the actor was not just harvesting credentials but successfully leveraging them for privileged access, possibly through cracked accounts, reused credentials, or insider-sourced passwords. The presence of such accounts in conjunction with password rotation entries marked as 변경완료 (“change complete”) further implies active control over PAM-protected systems during the operational window captured in the dump.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these logs demonstrate a methodical campaign combining external brute-force access, PKI service probing, and administrative credential takeover, a sequence tailored for persistent infiltration and lateral movement within sensitive government and enterprise networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Brute-force IPs: 23.95.213[.]210, 218.92.0[.]210, 122.114.233[.]77&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;122.114.233[.]77&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Presumed PRC local ISP&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Possibly mobile/ISP-based proxy used to obfuscate lateral movement&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PAM/OCSP errors targeting gva.gpki.go[.]kr, ivs.gpki.go[.]kr&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Superuser login events under 최고 관리자 (Super Administrator)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Part II: Goals Analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Targeting South Korea: Identity, Infrastructure, and Credential Theft&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Kim” operator’s campaign against South Korea was deliberate and strategic, aiming to infiltrate the nation’s digital trust infrastructure at multiple levels. A central focus was the Government Public Key Infrastructure (GPKI), where the attacker exfiltrated certificate files, including .key and .crt formats, some with plaintext passwords, and attempted repeated authentication against domains like gva.gpki.go[.]kr and ivs.gpki.go[.]kr. OCR tools were used to parse Korean technical documents detailing PKI and VPN architectures, demonstrating a sophisticated effort to understand and potentially subvert national identity frameworks. These efforts were not limited to reconnaissance; administrative password changes were logged, and phishing kits targeted military and diplomatic webmail, including clones of mofa.go[.]kr and credential harvesting through adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) proxy setups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond authentication systems, Kim targeted privileged accounts (oracle, unwadm, svradmin) and rotated credentials to maintain persistent administrative access, as evidenced by PAM and SSH logs showing elevated user activity under the title 최고 관리자 (“Super Administrator”). The actor also showed interest in bypassing VPN controls, parsing SecuwaySSL configurations for exploitation potential, and deployed custom Linux rootkits using syscall hooking to establish covert persistence on compromised machines. Taken together, the dump reveals a threat actor deeply invested in credential dominance, policy reconnaissance, and system-level infiltration, placing South Korea’s public sector identity systems, administrative infrastructure, and secure communications at the core of its long-term espionage objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Taiwan Reconnaissance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the most notable aspects of the “Kim” leak is the operator’s deliberate focus on Taiwanese infrastructure. The attacker accessed a number of domains with clear affiliations to the island’s public and private sectors, including tw.systexcloud[.]com (linked to enterprise cloud solutions), mlogin.mdfapps[.]com (a mobile authentication or enterprise login portal), and the .git/ directory of caa.org[.]tw, which belongs to the Chinese Institute of Aeronautics, a government-adjacent research entity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This last domain is especially telling. Accessing .git/ paths directly implies an attempt to enumerate internal source code repositories, a tactic often used to discover hardcoded secrets, API keys, deployment scripts, or developer credentials inadvertently exposed via misconfigured web servers. This behavior points to more technical depth than simple phishing; it indicates supply chain reconnaissance and long-term infiltration planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The associated IP addresses further reinforce this conclusion. All three, 163.29.3[.]119, 118.163.30[.]45, and 59.125.159[.]81, are registered to academic, government, or research backbone providers in Taiwan. These are not random scans; they reflect targeted probing of strategic digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary of Whois &amp;amp; Ownership Insights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;118.163.30[.]45 &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Appears as part of the IP range used for the domain dtc-tpe.com[.]tw, linked to Taiwan’s HINET provider (118.163.30[.]46 )Site Indices page of HINET provider.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;163.29.3[.]119 &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Falls within the 163.29.3[.]0/24 subnet identified with Taiwanese government or institutional use, notably in Taipei. This corresponds to B‑class subnets assigned to public/government entities IP地址 (繁體中文).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;59.125.159[.]81&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Belongs to the broader 59.125.159[.]0–59.125.159[.]254 block, commonly used by Taiwanese ISP operators such as Chunghwa Telecom in Taipei&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taken together, this Taiwan-focused activity reveals an expanded operational mandate. Whether the attacker is purely DPRK-aligned or operating within a DPRK–PRC fusion cell, the intent is clear: compromise administrative and developer infrastructure in Taiwan, likely in preparation for broader credential theft, espionage, or disruption campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Targeted domains: tw.systexcloud[.]com, caa.org[.]tw/.git/, mlogin.mdfapps[.]com&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IPs linked to Taiwanese academic/government assets: 163.29.3[.]119, 118.163.30[.]45, 59.125.159[.]81&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Git crawling suggests interest in developer secrets or exposed tokens&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hybrid Attribution Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Kim” operator embodies the growing complexity of modern nation-state attribution, where cyber activities often blur traditional boundaries and merge capabilities across geopolitical spheres. This case reveals strong indicators of both North Korean origin and Chinese operational entanglement, presenting a textbook example of a hybrid APT model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On one hand, the technical and linguistic evidence strongly supports a DPRK-native operator. Terminal environments, OCR parsing routines, and system artifacts consistently leverage Korean language and character sets. The operator’s activities reflect a deep understanding of Korean PKI systems, with targeted extraction of GPKI .key files and automation to parse sensitive Korean government PDF documentation. These are hallmarks of Kimsuky/APT43 operations, known for credential-focused espionage against South Korean institutions and diplomatic targets. The intent to infiltrate identity infrastructure is consistent with North Korea’s historical targeting priorities. Notably, the system time zone on Kim’s host machine was set to UTC+9 (Pyongyang Standard Time), reinforcing the theory that the actor maintains direct ties to the DPRK’s internal environment, even if operating remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this actor’s digital footprint extends well into Chinese infrastructure. Browser and download logs reveal frequent interaction with platforms like gitee[.]com, baidu[.]com, and zhihu[.]com, highly popular within the PRC but unusual for DPRK operators who typically minimize exposure to foreign services. Moreover, session logs include simplified Chinese content and PRC browsing behaviors, suggesting that the actor may be physically operating within China or through Chinese-language systems. This aligns with longstanding intelligence on North Korean cyber operators stationed in Chinese border cities such as Shenyang and Dandong, where DPRK nationals often conduct cyber operations with tacit approval or logistical consent from Chinese authorities. These locations provide higher-speed internet, relaxed oversight, and convenient geopolitical proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The targeting of Taiwanese infrastructure further complicates attribution. Kimsuky has not historically prioritized Taiwan, yet in this case, the actor demonstrated direct reconnaissance of Taiwanese government and developer networks. While this overlaps with Chinese APT priorities, recent evidence from the “Kim” dump, including analysis of phishing kits and credential theft workflows, suggests this activity was likely performed by a DPRK actor exploring broader regional interests, possibly in alignment with Chinese strategic goals. Researchers have noted that Kimsuky operators have recently asked questions in phishing lures related to potential Chinese-Taiwanese conflicts, implying interest beyond the Korean peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some tooling overlaps with PRC-linked APTs, particularly GitHub-based stagers and proxy-resolving modules, but these are not uncommon in the open-source malware ecosystem and may reflect opportunistic reuse rather than deliberate mimicry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;IMINT Analysis: Visual Tradecraft and Cultural Camouflage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A review of image artifacts linked to the “Kim” actor reveals a deliberate and calculated use of Chinese social and technological visual content as part of their operational persona. These images, extracted from browser history and uploads attributed to the actor, demonstrate both strategic alignment with DPRK priorities and active cultural camouflage within the PRC digital ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The visual set includes promotional graphics for Honor smartphones, SoC chipset evolution charts, Weibo posts featuring vehicle registration certificates, meme-based sarcasm, and lifestyle imagery typical of Chinese internet users. Notably, the content is exclusively rendered in simplified Chinese, reinforcing prior assessments that the operator either resides within mainland China or maintains a working digital identity embedded in Chinese platforms. Devices and services referenced, such as Xiaomi phones, Zhihu, Weibo, and Baidu, suggest intimate familiarity with PRC user environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operationally, this behavior achieves two goals. First, it enables the actor to blend in seamlessly with native PRC user activity, which complicates attribution and helps bypass platform moderation or behavioral anomaly detection. Second, the content itself may serve as bait or credibility scaffolding (e.g. A framework to give the illusion of trust to allow for easier compromise ) in phishing and social engineering campaigns, especially those targeting developers or technical users on Chinese-language platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some images, such as the detailed chipset timelines and VPN or device certification posts, suggest a continued interest in supply chain reconnaissance and endpoint profiling—both tradecraft hallmarks of Kimsuky and similar APT units. Simultaneously, meme humor, sarcastic overlays, and visual metaphors (e.g., the “Kaiju’s tail is showing” idiom) indicate the actor’s fluency in PRC netizen culture and possible mockery of operational security breaches—whether their own or others’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taken together, this IMINT corpus supports the broader attribution model: a DPRK-origin operator embedded, physically or virtually, within the PRC, leveraging local infrastructure and social platforms to facilitate long-term campaigns against South Korea, Taiwan, and other regional targets while maintaining cultural and technical deniability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attribution Scenarios:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Option A: DPRK Operator Embedded in PRC&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use of Korean language, OCR targeting of Korean documents, and focus on GPKI systems strongly suggest North Korean origin.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use of PRC infrastructure (e.g., Baidu, Gitee) and simplified Chinese content implies the operator is physically located in China or benefits from access to Chinese internet infrastructure.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use of Korean language, OCR targeting of Korean documents, and focus on GPKI systems strongly suggest North Korean origin.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Option B: PRC Operator Emulating DPRK&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Taiwan-focused reconnaissance aligns with PRC cyber priorities.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use of open-source tooling and phishing methods shared with PRC APTs could indicate tactical emulation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Taiwan-focused reconnaissance aligns with PRC cyber priorities.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The preponderance of evidence supports the hypothesis that “Kim” is a North Korean cyber operator embedded in China or collaborating with PRC infrastructure providers. This operational model allows the DPRK to amplify its reach, mask attribution, and adopt regional targeting strategies beyond South Korea, particularly toward Taiwan. As this hybrid model matures, it reflects the strategic adaptation of DPRK-aligned threat actors who exploit the permissive digital environment of Chinese networks to evade detection and expand their operational playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Targeting Profiles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Kim” leak provides one of the clearest windows to date into the role-specific targeting preferences of the operator, revealing a deliberate focus on system administrators, credential issuers, and backend developers, particularly in South Korea and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In South Korea, the operator’s interest centers around PKI administrators and infrastructure engineers. The recovered OCR commands were used to extract technical details from PDF documents outlining Korea’s digital signature protocols, such as identity verification, certificate validation, and encrypted communications, components that form the backbone of Korea’s secure authentication systems. The goal appears to be not only credential theft but full understanding and potential replication of government-trusted PKI procedures. This level of targeting suggests a strategic intent to penetrate deeply trusted systems, potentially for use in later spoofing or identity masquerading operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, the operator shifted focus to developer infrastructure and cloud access portals. Specific domains accessed, like caa.org[.]tw/.git/, indicate attempts to enumerate internal repositories, most likely to discover hardcoded secrets, authentication tokens, or deployment keys. This is a classic supply chain targeting method, aiming to access downstream systems via compromised developer credentials or misconfigured services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional activity pointed to interaction with cloud service login panels such as tw.systexcloud[.]com and mlogin.mdfapps[.]com. These suggest an attempt to breach centralized authentication systems or identity providers, granting the actor broader access into enterprise or government networks with a single credential set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taken together, these targeting profiles reflect a clear emphasis on identity providers, backend engineers, and those with access to system-level secrets. This reinforces the broader theme of the dump: persistent, credential-first intrusion strategies, augmented by reconnaissance of authentication standards, key management policies, and endpoint development infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;South Korean:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PKI admins, infrastructure engineers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OCR focus on Korean identity standards&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwanese:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Developer endpoints and internal .git/ repos&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access to cloud panels and login gateways&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Assessment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Kim” leak represents one of the most comprehensive and technically intimate disclosures ever associated with Kimsuky (APT43) or its adjacent operators. It not only reaffirms known tactics, credential theft, phishing, and PKI compromise, but exposes the inner workings of the operator’s environment, tradecraft, and operational intent in ways rarely observed outside of active forensic investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the core of the leak is a technically competent actor, well-versed in low-level shellcode development, Linux-based persistence mechanisms, and certificate infrastructure abuse. Their use of NASM, API hashing, and rootkit deployment points to custom malware authorship. Furthermore, the presence of parsed government-issued Korean PDFs, combined with OCR automation, shows not just opportunistic data collection but a concerted effort to model, mimic, or break state-level identity systems, particularly South Korea’s GPKI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The operator’s cultural and linguistic fluency in Korean, and their targeting of administrative and privileged systems across South Korean institutions, support a high-confidence attribution to a DPRK-native threat actor. However, the extensive use of Chinese platforms like gitee[.]com, Baidu, and Zhihu, and Chinese infrastructure for both malware hosting and browsing activity reveals a geographical pivot or collaboration: a hybrid APT footprint rooted in DPRK tradecraft but operating from or with Chinese support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most notably, this leak uncovers a geographical expansion of operational interest; the actor is no longer solely focused on the Korean peninsula. The targeting of Taiwanese developer portals, government research IPs, and .git/ repositories shows a broadened agenda that likely maps to both espionage and supply chain infiltration priorities. This places Taiwan, like South Korea, at the forefront of North Korean cyber interest, whether for intelligence gathering, credential hijacking, or as staging points for more complex campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The threat uncovered here is not merely malware or phishing; it is an infrastructure-centric, credential-first APT campaign that blends highly manual operations (e.g., hand-compiled shellcode, direct OCR of sensitive PDFs) with modern deception tactics such as AiTM phishing and TLS proxy abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations in Taiwan and South Korea, particularly those managing identity, certificate, and cloud access infrastructure, should consider themselves under persistent, credential-focused surveillance. Defensive strategies must prioritize detection of behavioral anomalies (e.g., use of OCR tools, GPKI access attempts), outbound communications with spoofed Korean domains, and the appearance of low-level toolchains like NASM or proxyres-based scanning utilities within developer or admin environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short: the “Kim” actor embodies the evolution of nation-state cyber threats—a fusion of old-school persistence, credential abuse, and modern multi-jurisdictional staging. The threat is long-term, embedded, and adaptive.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;192.168.130[.]117&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;192.168.150[.]117&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;192.168.0[.]39&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Operator Environment: Internal Host IP Narrative&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The presence of internal IP addresses such as 192.168.130[.]117, 192.168.150[.]117, and 192.168.0[.]39 within the dump offers valuable insight into the attacker’s local infrastructure, an often-overlooked element in threat intelligence analysis. These addresses fall within private, non-routable RFC1918 address space, commonly assigned by consumer off-the-shelf (COTS) routers and small office/home office (SOHO) network gear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of the 192.168.0[.]0/16 subnet, particularly 192.168.0.x and 192.168.150.x, strongly suggests that the actor was operating from a residential or low-profile environment, not a formal nation-state facility or hardened infrastructure. This supports existing assessments that North Korean operators, particularly those affiliated with Kimsuky, often work remotely from locations in third countries such as China or Southeast Asia, where they can maintain inconspicuous, low-cost setups while accessing global infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the distinction between multiple internal subnets (130.x, 150.x, and 0.x) may indicate segmentation of test environments or multiple virtual machines running within a single NATed network. This aligns with the forensic evidence of iterative development and testing workflows seen in the .bash_history files, where malware stagers, rootkits, and API obfuscation utilities were compiled, cleaned, and rerun repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these IPs reveal an operator likely working from a clandestine, residential base of operations, with modest hardware and commercial-grade routers. This operational setup is consistent with known DPRK remote IT workers and cyber operators who avoid attribution by blending into civilian infrastructure. It also suggests the attacker may be physically located outside of North Korea, possibly embedded in a friendly or complicit environment, strengthening the case for China-based activity by DPRK nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Overlap or Confusion with Chinese Threat Actors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is notable evidence of operational blur between Kimsuky and Chinese APTs in the context of Taiwan. The 2025 “Kim” data breach revealed an attacker targeting Taiwan whose tools and phishing kits matched Kimsuky’s, yet whose personal indicators (language, browsing habits) suggested a Chinese national. Researchers concluded this actor was likely a Chinese hacker either mimicking Kimsuky tactics or collaborating with them.. In fact, the leaked files on DDoS Secrets hint that Kimsuky has “openly cooperated with other Chinese APTs and shared their tools and techniques”. This overlap can cause attribution confusion – a Taiwan-focused operation might initially be blamed on China but could involve Kimsuky elements, or vice versa. So far, consensus is that North Korean and Chinese cyber operations remain separate, but cases like “Kim” show how a DPRK-aligned actor can operate against Taiwan using TTPs common to Chinese groups, muddying the waters of attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The noted Diné (Navajo) weaver Marilou Schultz recently completed an intricate weaving composed of thick white lines on a black background, punctuated with reddish-orange diamonds. Although this striking rug may appear abstract, it shows the internal circuitry of a tiny silicon chip known as the 555 timer. This chip has hundreds of applications in everything from a sound generator to a windshield wiper controller. At one point, the 555 was the world's best-selling integrated circuit with billions sold. But how did the chip get turned into a rug?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 555 chip is constructed from a tiny flake of silicon with a layer of metallic wiring on top. In the rug, this wiring is visible as the thick white lines, while the silicon forms the black background. One conspicuous feature of the rug is the reddish-orange diamonds around the perimeter. These correspond to the connections between the silicon chip and its eight pins. Tiny golden bond wires—thinner than a human hair—are attached to the square bond pads to provide these connections. The circuitry of the 555 chip contains 25 transistors, silicon devices that can switch on and off. The rug is dominated by three large transistors, the filled squares with a 王 pattern inside, while the remaining transistors are represented by small dots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The weaving was inspired by a photo of the 555 timer die taken by Antoine Bercovici (Siliconinsider); I suggested this photo to Schultz as a possible subject for a rug. The diagram below compares the weaving (left) with the die photo (right). As you can see, the weaving closely follows the actual chip, but there are a few artistic differences. For instance, two of the bond pads have been removed, the circuitry at the top has been simplified, and the part number at the bottom has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Antoine took the die photo with a dark field microscope, a special type of microscope that produces an image on a black background. This image emphasizes the metal layer on the top of the die. In comparison, a standard bright-field microscope produced the image below. When a chip is manufactured, regions of silicon are "doped" with impurities to create transistors and resistors. These regions are visible in the image below as subtle changes in the color of the silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the weaving, the chip's design appears almost monumental, making it easy to forget that the actual chip is microscopic. For the photo below, I obtained a version of the chip packaged in a metal can, rather than the typical rectangle of black plastic. Cutting the top off the metal can reveals the tiny chip inside, with eight gold bond wires connecting the die to the pins of the package. If you zoom in on the photo, you may recognize the three large transistors that dominate the rug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The artist, Marilou Schultz, has been creating chip rugs since 1994, when Intel commissioned a rug based on the Pentium as a gift to AISES (American Indian Science &amp;amp; Engineering Society). Although Schultz learned weaving as a child, the Pentium rug was a challenge due to its complex pattern and lack of symmetry; a day's work might add just an inch to the rug. This dramatic weaving was created with wool from the long-horned Navajo-Churro sheep, colored with traditional plant dyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the 555 timer weaving, Schultz experimented with different materials. Silver and gold metallic threads represent the aluminum and copper in the chip. The artist explains that "it took a lot more time to incorporate the metallic threads," but it was worth the effort because "it is spectacular to see the rug with the metallics in the dark with a little light hitting it." Aniline dyes provided the black and lavender colors. Although natural logwood dye produces a beautiful purple, it fades over time, so Schultz used an aniline dye instead. The lavender colors are dedicated to the weaver's mother, who passed away in February; purple was her favorite color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inside the chip&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the 555 chip produce a particular time delay? You add external components—resistors and a capacitor—to select the time. The capacitor is filled (charged) at a speed controlled by the resistor. When the capacitor get "full", the 555 chip switches operation and starts emptying (discharging) the capacitor. It's like filling a sink: if you have a large sink (capacitor) and a trickle of water (large resistor), the sink fills slowly. But if you have a smal sink (capacitor) and a lot of water (small resistor), the sink fills quickly. By using different resistors and capacitors, the 555 timer can provide time intervals from microseconds to hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've constructed an interactive chip browser that shows how the regions of the rug correspond to specific electronic components in the physical chip. Click on any part of the rug to learn the function of the corresponding component in the chip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, two of the large square transistors turn the chip's output on or off, while the third large transistor discharges the capacitor when it is full. (To be precise, the capacitor goes between 1/3 full and 2/3 full to avoid issues near "empty" and "full".) The chip has circuits called comparators that detect when the capacitor's voltage reaches 1/3 or 2/3, switching between emptying and filling at those points. If you want more technical details about the 555 chip, see my previous articles: an early 555 chip, a 555 timer similar to the rug, and a more modern CMOS version of the 555.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The similarities between Navajo weavings and the patterns in integrated circuits have long been recognized. Marilou Schultz's weavings of integrated circuits make these visual metaphors into concrete works of art. This connection is not just metaphorical, however; in the 1960s, the semiconductor company Fairchild employed numerous Navajo workers to assemble chips in Shiprock, New Mexico. I wrote about this complicated history in The Pentium as a Navajo Weaving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work is being shown at SITE Santa Fe's Once Within a Time exhibition (running until January 2026). I haven't seen the exhibition in person, so let me know if you visit it.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did MVC get so F’ed up?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smalltalk MVC is defined in Design Pattern as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;MVC Consists of three kinds of objects. The Model is the application object, the View is its screen presentation, and the Controller defines the way the user interface reacts to user input.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However this definition has been abused over the years - Back in 2003 I gave a talk citing how bad Apple’s definition was. At the time it stated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A view object knows how to display and possibly edit data from the application’s model… A controller object acts as the intermediary between the application’s view objects and its model objects… Controllers are often the least reusable objects in an application, but that’s acceptable…2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course it isn’t acceptable and, over the years, Apple has refined their definition and now acknowledge the distinction between the traditional Smalltalk version of MVC and the Cocoa version.3 But the Cocoa version is still defined much as it was before:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A view object knows how to display, and might allow users to edit, the data from the application’s model… A controller object acts as the intermediary between the application’s view objects and its model objects…3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In looking at how iOS applications are written the sentiment that controllers (and now view-controllers) are often the least reusable components in an application still flourishes, even if it is now unstated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MVC (I’ll always use that term to refer to the Smalltalk form) has the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; figure: Smalltalk MVC4 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the solid lines imply a direct association. And the dashed lines an indirect association by an observer. So what we see is that the model is unaware of the view and controller, except indirectly through notifications, and hence the code in the Model is reusable. The controller and view bind to the model, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often the function of the Controller and View are tightly coupled into a “widget” or “control”. When Apple talks about a View-Controller in their model they are talking about a grab-bag of an uber-widget that is a composite of UIView widgets and multiple models. From what I’ve seen, including in Apple’s example code, it is usually a pretty big mess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key to getting MVC correct is understanding what models are. A model is simply an object5 which can be observed (a requirement for attaching views). For example, in ObjC an int is an object, but it is not observable. However, an ObjC object with an int property is observable using Key-Value Observing6. A model may encapsulate complex relationships between the model’s properties. A trivial model is one where each property is completely independent (think C struct vs. C++ class). From a notification the view should be able to determine, at a minimum:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What changed. It may be as simple as “the model bound to the view”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new value to display.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say our model is a trivial observable boolean (I can’t imagine a simpler model). What we want is a checkbox that binds to the observable boolean. When the controller requests a change in value, the boolean is updated, and the view is notified of the new state of the model. The model is unaware of what UI is attached to it, and in fact there could be multiple UIs, including something like a scripting system, attached to the same instance of the model. This is a form of data binding - though most data binding systems replicate the problems of their underlying widget set by treating the model as if it were observing the view, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrast this with most UI frameworks where you have a checkbox widget from which you can query the value and you receive a notification when the value has changed. This is pushing a model into the widget. With MVC you never ask a question like “what is the default state of this checkbox?” - the default state of the view is always the current state of the model. You would also never get the state of the checkbox - the state of the checkbox is simply a reflection of the state of the model. In a system where you get the state of a checkbox you are binding two models together by treating one as a view/controller of the other. Such a pattern doesn’t scale beyond trivial models, and even for those it introduces some ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I conjecture that one of the reasons why MVC has been so screwed up is because, unlike in Smalltalk, writing something as simple as an observable boolean is a bit of a pain in a language like Pascal or C. You quickly get into object ownership and lifetime issues and how to write bind expressions. If one also assumes that you have a 1:1 mapping from UI to model then there is some inherent inefficiency in the generalization. The Lisa team made some major compromises and the rest of the industry followed along.7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To support more complex views, the notification may need to specify what parts of the model changed and how those parts changed. For example, “image 58 was removed from the sequence”. A complete model is one that can support any view of that model type efficiently (related to the notion of a complete type and a type’s efficient basis).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One additional attribute of MVC is that it is a composite pattern. This is hinted at by the direct connection between the Controller and the View. As I said early, the view may contain state, this state is itself an object, and because this state is also displayed within the view it is observable. It is another model. I refers to this as the view’s model. This model may include things such as the visibility of a window, the tab the user was last looking at, and the portion of the model being viewed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying what the models are in your system is important. We usually do pretty good at identifying the major models. Such as “this is an image” - but often fall short of identifying the complete model, i.e. “this is an image with a collection of settings.” We end up with our model spread out within the code (an incidental type) and it makes it more difficult to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common model that is often completely overlooked is the model for function arguments. When you have a command, button, gesture, or menu item in your application, these are bound to a function. The function itself is not typically a zeroary function but rather has a set of arguments that are constructed through other parts of the UI. For example, if I have a list of images in my application, I might have a button to delete the selected images. Here the current selection is the argument to my delete command. To create a UI for the selection I must create a model of the arguments to my function. A precondition of delete is that the selection is not empty. This precondition must be observable in the argument model so it can be reflected in the view by disabling or hiding the button and in the controller be disallowing the user to click the button and issue the command. The same argument model can be shared for multiple commands within an application.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The "impossibly small" Microdot web framework&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Microdot web framework is quite small, as its name would imply; it supports both standard CPython and MicroPython, so it can be used on systems ranging from internet-of-things (IoT) devices all the way up to large, cloudy servers. It was developed by Miguel Grinberg, who gave a presentation about it at EuroPython 2025. His name may sound familiar from his well-known Flask Mega-Tutorial, which has introduced many to the Flask lightweight Python-based web framework. It should come as no surprise, then, that Microdot is inspired by its rather larger cousin, so Flask enthusiasts will find much to like in Microdot—and will come up to speed quickly should their needs turn toward smaller systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have looked at various pieces of this software stack along the way: Microdot itself in January 2024, MicroPython in 2023, and Flask as part of a look at Python microframeworks in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Grinberg began his talk with an introduction. He has been living in Ireland for a few years and "&lt;quote&gt;I make stuff&lt;/quote&gt;". That includes open-source projects, blog posts (on a Flask-based blog platform that he wrote), and "&lt;quote&gt;a bunch of books&lt;/quote&gt;". He works for Elastic and is one of the maintainers of the Elasticsearch Python client, "&lt;quote&gt;so maybe you have used some of the things that I made for money&lt;/quote&gt;". &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; With a chuckle, he asked: "&lt;quote&gt;Why do we need another web framework? We have so many already.&lt;/quote&gt;" The story starts with a move that he made to Ireland from the US in 2018; he rented a house with a "smart" heating controller and was excited to use it. There were two thermostats, one for each level of the house, and he was "&lt;quote&gt;really looking forward to the winter&lt;/quote&gt;" to see the system in action. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; As might be guessed, he could set target temperatures in each thermostat; they would communicate with the controller that would turn the heating on and off as needed. In addition, the system had a web server that could be used to query various parameters or to start and stop the heaters. You could even send commands via SMS text messages; "&lt;quote&gt;there's a SIM card somewhere in that box [...] very exciting stuff&lt;/quote&gt;". &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; When winter rolled around, it did not work that well, however; sometimes the house was too chilly or warm and he had to start and stop the heaters himself. He did some debugging and found that the thermostats were reporting temperatures that were off by ±3°C, "&lt;quote&gt;which is too much for trying to keep the house at 20°&lt;/quote&gt;". The owner of the house thought that he was too used to the US where things just work; "&lt;quote&gt;at least she thinks that in America everything is super-efficient, everything works, and she thought 'this is the way things work in Ireland'&lt;/quote&gt;". So he did not make any progress with the owner. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; At that point, most people would probably just give up and live with the problem; "&lt;quote&gt;I hacked my heating controller instead&lt;/quote&gt;". He set the temperatures in both thermostats to zero, which effectively disabled their ability to affect the heaters at all, and built two small boards running MicroPython, each connected to a temperature and humidity sensor device. He wrote code that would check the temperature every five minutes and send the appropriate commands to start or stop the heaters based on what it found. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; So the second half of his first winter in Ireland went great. The sensors are accurate to ±0.5°C, so "&lt;quote&gt;problem solved&lt;/quote&gt;". But, that led to a new problem for him. "&lt;quote&gt;I wanted to know things: What's the temperature right now? Is the heating running right now or not? How many hours did it run today compared to yesterday?&lt;/quote&gt;" And so on. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He added a small LCD screen to display some information, but he had to actually go to the device and look at it; what he really wanted was to be able to talk to the device over WiFi and get information from the couch while he was watching TV. "&lt;quote&gt;I wanted to host a web server [...] that will show me a little dashboard&lt;/quote&gt;". &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; So he searched for web frameworks for MicroPython; in the winter of 2018-2019, "&lt;quote&gt;there were none&lt;/quote&gt;". Neither Flask nor Bottle, which is a good bit smaller, would run on MicroPython; both are too large for the devices, but, in addition, the standard library for MicroPython is a subset of that of CPython, so many things that they need are missing. A "&lt;quote&gt;normal person&lt;/quote&gt;" would likely have just accepted that and moved on; "&lt;quote&gt;I created a web framework instead.&lt;/quote&gt;" &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Demo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He brought one of his thermostat devices to Prague for the conference and did a small demonstration of it operating during the talk. The device was connected to his laptop using USB, which provided power, but also a serial connection to the board. On the laptop, he used the rshell remote MicroPython shell to talk to the board, effectively using the laptop as a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He started the MicroPython read-eval-print loop (REPL) on the board in order to simulate the normal operation of the board. When it is plugged into the wall, rather than a laptop, it will boot to the web server, so he made that happen with a soft-reboot command. The device then connected to the conference WiFi and gave him the IP address (and port) where the server was running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He switched over to Firefox on his laptop and visited the site, which showed a dashboard that had the current temperature (24.4°) and relative humidity (56.9%) of the room. He also used curl from the laptop to contact the api endpoint of the web application, which returned JSON with the two values and the time. There is no persistent clock on the board, so the application contacts an NTP server to pick up the time when it boots; that allows it to report the last time a measurement was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Grinberg said that he wanted to set the expectations at the right level by looking at the capabilities of the microcontrollers he often uses with Microdot. For example, the ESP8266 in his thermostat device has 64KB of RAM and up to 4MB of flash. The ESP8266 is the smallest and least expensive (around €5) device with WiFi that he has found; there are many even smaller devices, but they lack the networking required for running a web server. The other devices he uses are the Raspberry Pi Pico W with 2MB of flash and 256KB of RAM and the ESP32 with up to 8MB of flash and 512KB of RAM. He contrasted those with his laptop, which has 32GB of RAM, so "&lt;quote&gt;you need 500,000 ESP8266s&lt;/quote&gt;" to have the same amount of memory. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core framework of Microdot is in a single microdot.py file. It is fully asynchronous, using the MicroPython subset of the CPython asyncio module, so it can run on both interpreters. It uses asyncio because that is the only way to do concurrency on the microcontrollers; there is no support for processes or threads on those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microdot has Flask-style route decorators to define URLs for the application. It has Request and Response classes, as well as hooks to run before and after requests, he said. Handling query strings, form data, and JSON are all available in Microdot via normal Python dictionaries. Importantly, it can handle streaming requests and responses; because of the limited memory of these devices, it may be necessary to split up the handling of larger requests or responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; It supports setting cookies and sending static files. Web applications can be constructed from a set of modules, using sub-applications, which are similar to Flask blueprints. It also has its own web server with TLS support. "&lt;quote&gt;I'm very proud of all the stuff I was able to fit in the core Microdot framework&lt;/quote&gt;", Grinberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He hoped that attendees would have to think for a minute to come up with things that are missing from Microdot, but they definitely do exist. There are some officially maintained extensions, each in its own single .py file, to fill some of those holes. They encompass functionality that is important, but he did not want to add to the core because that would make it too large to fit on the low-end ESP8266 that he is using.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; There is an extension for multipart forms, which includes file uploads; "&lt;quote&gt;this is extremely complicated to parse, it didn't make sense to add it into the core because most people don't do this&lt;/quote&gt;". There is support for WebSocket and server-sent events (SSE). Templates are supported using utemplate for both Python implementations or Jinja, which only works on CPython. There are extensions for basic and token-based authentication and for secure user logins with session data; the latter required a replacement for the CPython-only PyJWT, which Grinberg wrote and contributed to MicroPython as jwt.py. There is a small handful of other extensions that he quickly mentioned as well. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; "&lt;quote&gt;I consider the documentation as part of the framework&lt;/quote&gt;"; he is "&lt;quote&gt;kind of fanatical&lt;/quote&gt;" about documenting everything. If there is something missing or not explained well, "&lt;quote&gt;it's a bug that I need to fix&lt;/quote&gt;". He writes books, so the documentation is organized similarly; it comes in at 9,267 words, which equates to around 47 minutes of reading time. There is 100% test coverage, he said, and there are around 30 examples, with more coming. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; A design principle that he follows is "&lt;quote&gt;no dark magic&lt;/quote&gt;". An example of dark magic to him is the Flask application context, "&lt;quote&gt;which very few people understand&lt;/quote&gt;". In Microdot, the request object is explicitly passed to each route function. Another example is the dependency injection that is used by the FastAPI framework to add components; Microdot uses explicit decorators instead. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He used the cloc utility to count lines of code, while ignoring comments and blank lines. Using that, Django comes in at 110,000 lines, Flask plus its essential Werkzeug library is 15,500 lines, FastAPI with Starlette is 14,900 lines, Bottle is around 3,000 lines, while the Microdot core has 765 lines ("&lt;quote&gt;believe it or not&lt;/quote&gt;") and a full install with all the extensions on MicroPython comes in at just shy of 1,700 lines of code. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; He ended with an example of how Microdot can be so small by comparing the URL matching in Flask with Microdot. The Flask version does lots more than Microdot, with more supported types of arguments in a URL and multiple classes in the werkzeug.routing module; it has 1,362 lines of code. For Microdot, there is a more limited set of URL arguments, though there is still the ability to define custom types, and a single URLPattern class; all of that is done in 63 lines of code. "&lt;quote&gt;I don't intend to support everything that Flask supports, in terms of routing, but I intend to support the 20% that covers 80% of the use cases.&lt;/quote&gt;" That is the overall mechanism that he has used to get to something that is so small. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An audience member asked about whether the Microdot code was minified in order to get it to fit. Grinberg said that doing so was not all that useful for MicroPython, but the code is smaller on the board because it is precompiled on another system; that results in a microdot.mpy file, which is bytecode for MicroPython. For example, on the low-end device he is using for his thermostats, Microdot would not be able to be compiled on the device itself. There are some other tricks that can also be used for reducing the RAM requirements, like putting the code into the firmware as part of the MicroPython binary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The final question was about performance, and how many requests per second could be handled. Grinberg said that he did not have any real numbers, but that the device he demonstrated is "&lt;quote&gt;really really slow&lt;/quote&gt;". That question led to a blog post in late July where Grinberg tried to more fully answer it. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Posted Aug 23, 2025 15:26 UTC (Sat) by lyda (subscriber, #7429) [Link] (1 responses) When I wrote a lot of python, frameworks like this seemed great. But there's a better way. If you define the OpenAPI definition first, you can then generate the server, you can generate all the clients, you can generate tests for the server and client, as well as fuzz tests for the server. Less common, but you can do the same with gRPC. It also allows you to more easily move from one technology to another. Posted Aug 24, 2025 3:10 UTC (Sun) by ssmith32 (subscriber, #72404) [Link] Certainly not for the problem domain covered in the article. &lt;head&gt;OpenAPI or gRPC is a better path forward&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;OpenAPI or gRPC is a better path forward&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The craft of programming is almost universally concerned with different types of data and operations/algorithms that act on this data [1]. Therefore, it's hardly surprising that designing abstractions for data types and operations has been on the mind of software engineers and programming-language designers since... forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet I've only recently encountered a name for a software design problem which I ran into multiple times in my career. It's a problem so fundamental that I was quite surprised that I haven't seen it named before. Here is a quick problem statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine that we have a set of data types and a set of operations that act on these types. Sometimes we need to add more operations and make sure they work properly on all types; sometimes we need to add more types and make sure all operations work properly on them. Sometimes, however, we need to add both - and herein lies the problem. Most of the mainstream programming languages don't provide good tools to add both new types and new operations to an existing system without having to change existing code. This is called the "expression problem". Studying the problem and its possible solutions gives great insight into the fundamental differences between object-oriented and functional programming and well as concepts like interfaces and multiple dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A motivating example&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is my wont, my example comes from the world of compilers and interpreters. To my defense, this is also the example used in some of the seminal historic sources on the expression problem, as the historical perspective section below details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine we're designing a simple expression evaluator. Following the standard interpreter design pattern, we have a tree structure consisting of expressions, with some operations we can do on such trees. In C++ we'd have an interface every node in the expression tree would have to implement:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Expr {
public:
  virtual std::string ToString() const = 0;
  virtual double Eval() const = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This interface shows that we currently have two operations we can do on expression trees - evaluate them and query for their string representations. A typical leaf node expression:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Constant : public Expr {
public:
  Constant(double value) : value_(value) {}

  std::string ToString() const {
    std::ostringstream ss;
    ss &amp;lt;&amp;lt; value_;
    return ss.str();
  }

  double Eval() const {
    return value_;
  }

private:
  double value_;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And a typical composite expression:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class BinaryPlus : public Expr {
public:
  BinaryPlus(const Expr&amp;amp; lhs, const Expr&amp;amp; rhs) : lhs_(lhs), rhs_(rhs) {}

  std::string ToString() const {
    return lhs_.ToString() + " + " + rhs_.ToString();
  }

  double Eval() const {
    return lhs_.Eval() + rhs_.Eval();
  }

private:
  const Expr&amp;amp; lhs_;
  const Expr&amp;amp; rhs_;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, it's all fairly basic stuff. How extensible is this design? Let's see... if we want to add new expression types ("variable reference", "function call" etc.), that's pretty easy. We just define additional classes inheriting from Expr and implement the Expr interface (ToString and Eval).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, what happens if we want to add new operations that can be applied to expression trees? Right now we have Eval and ToString, but we may want additional operations like "type check" or "serialize" or "compile to machine code" or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that adding new operations isn't as easy as adding new types. We'd have to change the Expr interface, and consequently change every existing expression type to support the new method(s). If we don't control the original code or it's hard to change it for other reasons, we're in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, we'd have to violate the venerable open-closed principle, one of the main principles of object-oriented design, defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem we're hitting here is called the expression problem, and the example above shows how it applies to object-oriented programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the expression problem bites functional programming languages as well. Let's see how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The expression problem in functional programming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update 2018-02-05: a new post discusses the problem and its solutions in Haskell in more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Object-oriented approaches tend to collect functionality in objects (types). Functional languages cut the cake from a different angle, usually preferring types as thin data containers, collecting most functionality in functions (operations) that act upon them. Functional languages don't escape the expression problem - it just manifests there in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this, let's see how the expression evaluator / stringifier looks in Haskell. Haskell is a good poster child for functional programming since its pattern matching on types makes such code especially succinct:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module Expressions where

data Expr = Constant Double
          | BinaryPlus Expr Expr

stringify :: Expr -&amp;gt; String
stringify (Constant c) = show c
stringify (BinaryPlus lhs rhs) = stringify lhs
                                ++ " + "
                                ++ stringify rhs

evaluate :: Expr -&amp;gt; Double
evaluate (Constant c) = c
evaluate (BinaryPlus lhs rhs) = evaluate lhs + evaluate rhs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let's say we want to add a new operation - type checking. We simply have to add a new function typecheck and define how it behaves for all known kinds of expressions. No need to modify existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we want to add a new type (like "function call"), we get into trouble. We now have to modify all existing functions to handle this new type. So we hit exactly the same problem, albeit from a different angle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The expression problem matrix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A visual representation of the expression problem can be helpful to appreciate how it applies to OOP and FP in different ways, and how a potential solution would look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following 2-D table (a "matrix") has types in its rows and operations in its columns. A matrix cell row, col is checked when the operation col is implemented for type row:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In object-oriented languages, it's easy to add new types but difficult to add new operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whereas in functional languages, it's easy to add new operations but difficult to add new types:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A historical perspective&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The expression problem isn't new, and has likely been with us since the early days; it pops its head as soon as programs reach some not-too-high level of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fairly certain that the name expression problem comes from an email sent by Philip Wadler to a mailing list deailing with adding generics to Java (this was back in the 1990s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that email, Wadler points to the paper "Synthesizing Object-Oriented and Functional Design to Promote Re-Use" by Krishnamurthi, Felleisen and Friedman as an earlier work describing the problem and proposed solutions. This is a great paper and I highly recommend reading it. Krishnamurthi et.al., in their references, point to papers from as early as 1975 describing variations of the problem in Algol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flipping the matrix with the visitor pattern&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far the article has focused on the expression problem, and I hope it's clear by now. However, the title also has the word solution in it, so let's turn to that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's possible to kinda solve (read on to understand why I say "kinda") the expression problem in object-oriented languages; first, we have to look at how we can flip the problem on its side using the visitor pattern. The visitor pattern is very common for this kind of problems, and for a good reason. It lets us reformulate our code in a way that makes it easier to change in some dimensions (though harder in others).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the C++ sample shown above, rewriting it using the visitor pattern means adding a new "visitor" interface:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class ExprVisitor {
public:
  virtual void VisitConstant(const Constant&amp;amp; c) = 0;
  virtual void VisitBinaryPlus(const BinaryPlus&amp;amp; bp) = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And changing the Expr interface to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Expr {
public:
  virtual void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now expression types defer the actual computation to the visitor, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Constant : public Expr {
public:
  Constant(double value) : value_(value) {}

  void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
    visitor-&amp;gt;VisitConstant(*this);
  }

  double GetValue() const {
    return value_;
  }

private:
  double value_;
};

// ... similarly, BinaryPlus would have
//
//    void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
//      visitor-&amp;gt;VisitBinaryPlus(*this);
//    }
//
// ... etc.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A sample visitor for evaluation would be [2]:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Evaluator : public ExprVisitor {
public:
  double GetValueForExpr(const Expr&amp;amp; e) {
    return value_map_[&amp;amp;e];
  }

  void VisitConstant(const Constant&amp;amp; c) {
    value_map_[&amp;amp;c] = c.GetValue();
  }

  void VisitBinaryPlus(const BinaryPlus&amp;amp; bp) {
    bp.GetLhs().Accept(this);
    bp.GetRhs().Accept(this);
    value_map_[&amp;amp;bp] = value_map_[&amp;amp;(bp.GetLhs())] + value_map_[&amp;amp;(bp.GetRhs())];
  }

private:
  std::map&amp;lt;const Expr*, double&amp;gt; value_map_;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be obvious that for a given set of data types, adding new visitors is easy and doesn't require modifying any other code. On the other hand, adding new types is problematic since it means we have to update the ExprVisitor interface with a new abstract method, and consequently update all the visitors to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it seems that we've just turned the expression problem on its side: we're using an OOP language, but now it's hard to add types and easy to add ops, just like in the functional approach. I find it extremely interesting that we can do this. In my eyes this highlights the power of different abstractions and paradigms, and how they enable us to rethink a problem in a completely different light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we haven't solved anything yet; we've just changed the nature of the problem we're facing. Worry not - this is just a stepping stone to an actual solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extending the visitor pattern&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following is code excerpts from a C++ solution that follows the extended visitor pattern proposed by Krishnamurthi et. al. in their paper; I strongly suggest reading the paper (particularly section 3) if you want to understand this code on a deep level. A complete code sample in C++ that compiles and runs is available here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding new visitors (ops) with the visitor pattern is easy. Our challenge is to add a new type without upheaving too much existing code. Let's see how it's done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One small design change that we should make to the original visitor pattern is use virtual inheritance for Evaluator, for reasons that will soon become obvious:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Evaluator : virtual public ExprVisitor {
  // .. the rest is the same
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we're going to add a new type - FunctionCall:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// This is the new ("extended") expression we're adding.
class FunctionCall : public Expr {
public:
  FunctionCall(const std::string&amp;amp; name, const Expr&amp;amp; argument)
      : name_(name), argument_(argument) {}

  void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
    ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall* v =
        dynamic_cast&amp;lt;ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall*&amp;gt;(visitor);
    if (v == nullptr) {
      std::cerr &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Fatal: visitor is not ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall\n";
      exit(1);
    }
    v-&amp;gt;VisitFunctionCall(*this);
  }

private:
  std::string name_;
  const Expr&amp;amp; argument_;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we don't want to modify the existing visitors, we create a new one, extending Evaluator for function calls. But first, we need to extend the ExprVisitor interface to support the new type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall : virtual public ExprVisitor {
public:
  virtual void VisitFunctionCall(const FunctionCall&amp;amp; fc) = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we write the new evaluator, which extends Evaluator and supports the new type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class EvaluatorWithFunctionCall : public ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall,
                                  public Evaluator {
public:
  void VisitFunctionCall(const FunctionCall&amp;amp; fc) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Visiting FunctionCall!!\n";
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple inheritance, virtual inheritance, dynamic type checking... that's pretty hard-core C++ we have to use here, but there's no choice. Unfortunately, multiple inheritance is the only way C++ lets us express the idea that a class implements some interface while at the same time deriving functionality from another class. What we want to have here is an evaluator (EvaluatorWithFunctionCall) that inherits all functionality from Evaluator, and also implements the ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall interface. In Java, we could say something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class EvaluatorWithFunctionCall extends Evaluator implements ExprVisitor {
  // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in C++ virtual multiple inheritance is the tool we have. The virtual part of the inheritance is essential here for the compiler to figure out that the ExprVisitor base underlying both Evaluator and ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall is the same and should only appear once in EvaluatorWithFunctionCall. Without virtual, the compiler would complain that EvaluatorWithFunctionCall doesn't implement the ExprVisitor interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a solution, alright. We kinda added a new type FunctionCall and can now visit it without changing existing code (assuming the virtual inheritance was built into the design from the start to anticipate this approach). Here I am using this "kinda" word again... it's time to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach has multiple flaws, in my opinion:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Note the dynamic_cast in FunctionCall::Accept. It's fairly ugly that we're forced to mix in dynamic checks into this code, which should supposedly rely on static typing and the compiler. But it's just a sign of a larger problem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If we have an instance of an Evaluator, it will no longer work on the whole extended expression tree since it has no understanding of FunctionCall. It's easy to say that all new evaluators should rather be EvaluatorWithFunctionCall, but we don't always control this. What about code that was already written? What about Evaluators created in third-party or library code which we have no control of?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The virtual inheritance is not the only provision we have to build into the design to support this pattern. Some visitors would need to create new, recursive visitors to process complex expressions. But we can't anticipate in advance which dynamic type of visitor needs to be created. Therefore, the visitor interface should also accept a "visitor factory" which extended visitors will supply. I know this sounds complicated, and I don't want to spend more time on this here - but the Krishnamurthi paper addresses this issue extensively in section 3.4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, the solution is unwieldy for realistic applications. Adding one new type looks manageable; what about adding 15 new types, gradually over time? Imagine the horrible zoo of ExprVisitor extensions and dynamic checks this would lead to.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, programming is hard. I could go on and on about the limitations of classical OOP and how they surface in this example [3]. Instead, I'll just present how the expression problem can be solved in a language that supports multiple dispatch and separates the defintion of methods from the bodies of types they act upon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Solving the expression problem in Clojure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways the expression problem as displayed in this article can be solved in Clojure using the language's built-in features. Let's start with the simplest one - multi-methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First we'll define the types as records:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defrecord Constant [value])
(defrecord BinaryPlus [lhs rhs])
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we'll define evaluate as a multimethod that dispatches upon the type of its argument, and add method implementations for Constant and BinaryPlus:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defmulti evaluate class)

(defmethod evaluate Constant
  [c] (:value c))

(defmethod evaluate BinaryPlus
  [bp] (+ (evaluate (:lhs bp)) (evaluate (:rhs bp))))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can already evaluate expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;user=&amp;gt; (use 'expression.multimethod)
nil
user=&amp;gt; (evaluate (-&amp;gt;BinaryPlus (-&amp;gt;Constant 1.1) (-&amp;gt;Constant 2.2)))
3.3000000000000003
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding a new operation is easy. Let's add stringify:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defmulti stringify class)

(defmethod stringify Constant
  [c] (str (:value c)))

(defmethod stringify BinaryPlus
  [bp]
  (clojure.string/join " + " [(stringify (:lhs bp))
                              (stringify (:rhs bp))]))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;user=&amp;gt; (stringify (-&amp;gt;BinaryPlus (-&amp;gt;Constant 1.1) (-&amp;gt;Constant 2.2)))
"1.1 + 2.2"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How about adding new types? Suppose we want to add FunctionCall. First, we'll define the new type. For simplicity, the func field of FunctionCall is just a Clojure function. In real code it could be some sort of function object in the language we're interpreting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defrecord FunctionCall [func argument])
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And define how evaluate and stringify work for FunctionCall:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defmethod evaluate FunctionCall
  [fc] ((:func fc) (evaluate (:argument fc))))

(defmethod stringify FunctionCall
  [fc] (str (clojure.repl/demunge (str (:func fc)))
            "("
            (stringify (:argument fc))
            ")"))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's take it for a spin (the full code is here):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;user=&amp;gt; (def callexpr (-&amp;gt;FunctionCall twice (-&amp;gt;BinaryPlus (-&amp;gt;Constant 1.1)
                                                         (-&amp;gt;Constant 2.2))))
#'user/callexpr
user=&amp;gt; (evaluate callexpr)
6.6000000000000005
user=&amp;gt; (stringify callexpr)
"expression.multimethod/twice@52e29c38(1.1 + 2.2)"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be evident that the expression problem matrix for Clojure is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can add new ops without touching any existing code. We can also add new types without touching any existing code. The code we're adding is only the new code to handle the ops/types in question. The existing ops and types could come from a third-party library to which we don't have source access. We could still extend them for our new ops and types, without ever having to touch (or even see) the original source code [4].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is multiple dispatch necessary to cleanly solve the expression problem?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've written about multiple dispatch in Clojure before, and in the previous section we see another example of how to use the language's defmulti/defmethod constructs. But is it multiple dispatch at all? No! It's just single dispatch, really. Our ops (evaluate and stringify) dispatch on a single argument - the expression type) [5].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we're not really using multiple dispatch, what is the secret sauce that lets us solve the expression problem so elegantly in Clojure? The answer is - open methods. Note a crucial difference between how methods are defined in C++/Java and in Clojure. In C++/Java, methods have to be part of a class and defined (or at least declared) in its body. You cannot add a method to a class without changing the class's source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Clojure, you can. In fact, since data types and multimethods are orthogonal entities, this is by design. Methods simply live outside types - they are first class citizens, rather than properties of types. We don't add methods to a type, we add new methods that act upon the type. This doesn't require modifying the type's code in any way (or even having access to its code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the other popular programming languages take a middle way. In languages like Python, Ruby and JavaScript methods belong to types, but we can dynamically add, remove and replace methods in a class even after it was created. This technique is lovingly called monkey patching. While initially enticing, it can lead to big maintainability headaches in code unless we're very careful. Therefore, if I had to face the expression problem in Python I'd prefer to roll out some sort of multiple dispatch mechanism for my program rather than rely on monkey patching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Another Clojure solution - using protocols&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clojure's multimethods are very general and powerful. So general, in fact, that their performance may not be optimal for the most common case - which is single dispatch based on the type of the sole method argument; note that this is exactly the kind of dispatch I'm using in this article. Therefore, starting with Clojure 1.2, user code gained the ability to define and use protocols - a language feature that was previously restricted only to built-in types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protocols leverage the host platform's (which in Clojure's case is mostly Java) ability to provide quick virtual dispatch, so using them is a very efficient way to implement runtime polymorphism. In addition, protocols retain enough of the flexibility of multimethods to elegantly solve the expression problem. Curiously, this was on the mind of Clojure's designers right from the start. The Clojure documentation page about protocols lists this as one of their capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;[...] Avoid the 'expression problem' by allowing independent extension of the set of types, protocols, and implementations of protocols on types, by different parties. [...] do so without wrappers/adapters&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clojure protocols are an interesting topic, and while I'd like to spend some more time on them, this article is becoming too long as it is. So I'll leave a more thorough treatment for some later time and for now will just show how protocols can also be used to solve the expression problem we're discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The type definitions remain the same:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defrecord Constant [value])
(defrecord BinaryPlus [lhs rhs])
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, instead of defining a multimethod for each operation, we now define a protocol. A protocol can be thought of as an interface in a language like Java, C++ or Go - a type implements an interface when it defines the set of methods declared by the interface. In this respect, Clojure's protocols are more like Go's interfaces than Java's, as we don't have to say a-priori which interfaces a type implements when we define it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start with the Evaluatable protocol, that consists of a single method - evaluate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defprotocol Evaluatable
  (evaluate [this]))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another protocol we'll define is Stringable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defprotocol Stringable
  (stringify [this]))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can make sure our types implement these protocols:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(extend-type Constant
  Evaluatable
    (evaluate [this] (:value this))
  Stringable
    (stringify [this] (str (:value this))))

(extend-type BinaryPlus
  Evaluatable
    (evaluate [this] (+ (evaluate (:lhs this)) (evaluate (:rhs this))))
  Stringable
    (stringify [this]
      (clojure.string/join " + " [(stringify (:lhs this))
                                  (stringify (:rhs this))])))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extend-type macro is a convenience wrapper around the more general extend - it lets us implement multiple protocols for a given type. A sibling macro named extend-protocol lets us implement the same protocol for multiple types in the same invocation [6].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fairly obvious that adding new data types is easy - just as we did above, we simply use extend-type for each new data type to implement our current protocols. But how do we add a new protocol and make sure all existing data types implement it? Once again, it's easy because we don't have to modify any existing code. Here's a new protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(defprotocol Serializable
  (serialize [this]))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is its implementation for the currently supported data types:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(extend-protocol Serializable
  Constant
    (serialize [this] [(type this) (:value this)])
  BinaryPlus
    (serialize [this] [(type this)
                       (serialize (:lhs this))
                       (serialize (:rhs this))]))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, extending a single protocol for multiple data types - extend-protocol is the more convenient macro to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Small interfaces are extensibility-friendly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have noted that the protocols (interfaces) defined in the Clojure solution are very small - consisting of a single method. Since adding methods to an existing protocol is much more problematic (I'm not aware of a way to do this in Clojure), keeping protocols small is a good idea. This guideline comes up in other contexts as well; for example, it's good practice to keep interfaces in Go very minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our C++ solution, splitting the Expr interface could also be a good idea, but it wouldn't help us with the expression problem, since we can't modify which interfaces a class implements after we've defined it; in Clojure we can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[1]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"Types of data" and "operations" are two terms that should be fairly obvious to modern-day programmers. Philip Wadler, in his discussion of the expression problem (see the "historical perspective" section of the article) calls them "datatypes" and "functions". A famous quote from Fred Brooks's The Mythical Man Month (1975) is "Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I wonât usually need your flowcharts; theyâll be obvious."&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[2]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Note the peculiar way in which data is passed between Visit* methods in a Expr* -&amp;gt; Value map kept in the visitor. This is due to our inability to make Visit* methods return different types in different visitors. For example, in Evaluator we'd want them to return double, but in Stringifier they'd probably return std::string. Unfortunately C++ won't let us easily mix templates and virtual functions, so we have to resort to either returning void* the C way or the method I'm using here.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Curiously, in their paper Krishnamurthi et.al. run into the same issue in the dialect of Java they're using, and propose some language extensions to solve it. Philip Wadler uses proposed Java generics in his approach.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[3]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;I can't resist, so just in brief: IMHO inheritance is only good for a very narrow spectrum of uses, but languages like C++ hail it as the main extension mechanism of types. But inheritance is deeply flawed for many other use cases, such as implementations of interfaces. Java is a bit better in this regard, but in the end the primacy of classes and their "closed-ness" make a lot of tasks - like the expression problem - very difficult to express in a clean way.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[4]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;In fact, there are plenty of examples in which the Clojure implementation and the standard library provide protocols that can be extended by the user for user-defined types. Extending user-written protocols and multimethods for built-in types is trivial. As an exercise, add an evaluate implementation for java.lang.Long, so that built-in integers could participate in our expression trees without requiring wrapping in a Constant.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[5]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;FWIW, we can formulate a multiple dispatch solution to the expression problem in Clojure. The key idea is to dispatch on two things: type and operation. Just for fun, I coded a prototype that does this which you can see here. I think the approach presented in the article - each operation being its own multimethod - is preferable, though.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[6]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The sharp-eyed reader will notice a cool connection to the expression problem matrix. extend-type can add a whole new row to the matrix, while extend-protocol adds a column. extend adds just a single cell.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;ck (seek) finds code by meaning, not just keywords. It's a drop-in replacement for &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; that understands what you're looking for — search for "error handling" and find try/catch blocks, error returns, and exception handling code even when those exact words aren't present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cargo install ck-search&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Find error handling patterns (finds try/catch, Result types, etc.)
ck --sem "error handling" src/

# Traditional grep-compatible search still works  
ck -n "TODO" *.rs

# Combine both: semantic relevance + keyword filtering
ck --hybrid "connection timeout" src/&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Developers: Stop hunting through thousands of regex false positives. Find the code you actually need by describing what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For AI Agents: Get structured, semantic search results in JSON format. Perfect for code analysis, documentation generation, and automated refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Teams: Works exactly like &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; with the same flags and behavior, but adds semantic intelligence when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Build from source
cargo build --release

# Index your project for semantic search
./target/debug/ck --index src/

# Search by meaning
./target/debug/ck --sem "authentication logic" src/
./target/debug/ck --sem "database connection pooling" src/
./target/debug/ck --sem "retry mechanisms" src/

# Use all the grep features you know
./target/debug/ck -n -C 3 "error" src/
./target/debug/ck -R "TODO|FIXME" .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find code by concept, not keywords. Searches understand synonyms, related terms, and conceptual similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# These find related code even without exact keywords:
ck --sem "retry logic"           # finds backoff, circuit breakers
ck --sem "user authentication"   # finds login, auth, credentials  
ck --sem "data validation"       # finds sanitization, type checking

# Get complete functions/classes containing matches (NEW!)
ck --sem --full-section "error handling"  # returns entire functions
ck --full-section "async def" src/        # works with regex too&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All your muscle memory works. Same flags, same behavior, same output format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ck -i "warning" *.log              # Case-insensitive  
ck -n -A 3 -B 1 "error" src/       # Line numbers + context
ck --no-filename "TODO" src/        # Suppress filenames (grep -h equivalent)
ck -l "error" src/                  # List files with matches only (NEW!)
ck -L "TODO" src/                   # List files without matches (NEW!)
ck -R --exclude "*.test.js" "bug"  # Recursive with exclusions
ck "pattern" file1.txt file2.txt   # Multiple files&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combine keyword precision with semantic understanding using Reciprocal Rank Fusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ck --hybrid "async timeout" src/    # Best of both worlds
ck --hybrid --scores "cache" src/   # Show relevance scores with color highlighting
ck --hybrid --threshold 0.02 query  # Filter by minimum relevance
ck -l --hybrid "database" src/      # List files using hybrid search&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perfect JSON output for LLMs, scripts, and automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ck --json --sem "error handling" src/ | jq '.file'
ck --json --topk 5 "TODO" . | jq -r '.preview'
ck --json --full-section --sem "database" . | jq -r '.preview'  # Complete functions&lt;/code&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--sem&lt;/code&gt;: Pure semantic search using embeddings (requires index)&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Q: How is this different from grep/ripgrep/silver-searcher?&lt;lb/&gt; A: ck includes all the features of traditional search tools, but adds semantic understanding. Search for "error handling" and find relevant code even when those exact words aren't used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Does it work offline?&lt;lb/&gt; A: Yes, completely offline. The embedding model runs locally with no network calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: How big are the indexes?&lt;lb/&gt; A: Typically 1-3x the size of your source code, depending on content. The &lt;code&gt;.ck/&lt;/code&gt; directory can be safely deleted to reclaim space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Is it fast enough for large codebases?&lt;lb/&gt; A: Yes. Indexing is a one-time cost, and searches are sub-second even on large projects. Regex searches require no indexing and are as fast as grep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Can I use it in scripts/automation?&lt;lb/&gt; A: Absolutely. The &lt;code&gt;--json&lt;/code&gt; flag provides structured output perfect for automated processing. Use &lt;code&gt;--full-section&lt;/code&gt; to get complete functions for AI analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: What about privacy/security?&lt;lb/&gt; A: Everything runs locally. No code or queries are sent to external services. The embedding model is downloaded once and cached locally.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Effects make your code testable&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One of the central goals of enterprise software development. Dependency injection, mocking, architecture patterns like clean, hexagonal, DDD are all meant to tackle this. Effects solve this elegantly by separating the “what” from the “how”.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Effects give immediate visibility into what your own and 3rd-party code is doing&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Supply chain attacks are real. And they will get worse with more AI slop entering our codebases. Tools like Go’s Capslock fix this by following the whole chain of calls to stdlib functions. Effects provide this by design, as all effects are tracked by the type and effect system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Effects enable user-defined control flow abstractions&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Solving the “what color is your function” problem1. You can also leverage effects to implement Async/await, coroutines, backtracking search and other control flow patterns as user libraries without hard-coding these features into the language.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Algebraic effects come from the pure functional world, serving a purpose similar to monads — keeping track of and having control over side effects. Like monads, they enable us to write our core logic with pure functions and push side effects like IO outwards, closer to application boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike monads, effects are easy to grasp for a regular developer and give immediate benefits when starting out. For me personally they’re a more natural abstraction for managing side effects — after all, effects are in the name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting out as an academic concept, algebraic effects were introduced to the world by research languages like Eff, Koka, Effekt, Frank, Links, and more recently Ante.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have also applied effects in practice, so far usually via a monad-based approach, by making libraries in established languages like Scala Kyo / Cats Effect / ZIO; Typescript Effect and Effector, C# language-ext, C libhandler and libmprompt, C++ cpp-effects, various Haskell libraries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to forcing you into a monadic way of thinking, libraries implementing effects are limited by their host languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, I will walk you through applying algebraic effects on a real world example using Flix, a new programming language that is built with effects from the ground up, and supports functional, logic and imperative paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Footnotes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently only few languages support effects out of the box. The only one that I know of besides Flix is Unison. OCaml has a language extension, but there is no support yet in the type system. Haskell has added support for delimited continuations, but effects are still only available via libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to having a “type and effect system” that improves function signatures and makes sure all effects are handled, Flix supports traits, local mutability via regions, working with immutable or mutable data, and Go/Rust-like structured concurrency. It also has a first-class Datalog integration. But I will only focus on effects here. Let’s start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Type and Effect System: A Motivating Example 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a function called &lt;code&gt;calculateSalary&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def calculateSalary(base_salary, bonus_percent):
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the function name and the signature, one can assume it’s just a pure function that does some calculations. In a statically typed language you are also guaranteed that the function arguments and outputs will be of a certain type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if the types are correct, nothing stops our little &lt;code&gt;calculateSalary()&lt;/code&gt; from, say, sending an offensive email to your grandma2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def calculateSalary(base_salary, bonus_percent):
    server.sendmail("grandma@family.com", "Your cookies are terrible!")
    return base_salary * (1 + bonus_percent/100)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, you extend your type system with effects, you will see immediately in the signature that this function may do something fishy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def calculateSalary(salary: Float64, percent: Float64): 
    Float64 \ {Email} = {
//            ^^^^^^^ Notice the Email effect!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, in real life the issue it’s not usually about the grandma. Instead, this function could throw an exception — still quite dangerous. If you forget to handle the exception, your app will crash. Or another very realistic scenario is that &lt;code&gt;calculateSalary()&lt;/code&gt; calls a database to get some employee details for calculations, and you forgot to provide a database connection string. That can also result in an exception or a panic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Effect Handlers: Building Intuition 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The job of the type and effect system is not just to improve our function signatures. It’s also making sure all the effects are handled somewhere. This is where effect handlers come in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually when people talk about algebraic effects what they’re actually talking about is effect handlers. If you know exceptions, effect handlers are super easy to understand. Here’s a Jenga analogy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine the call stack is a Jenga tower. New blocks are carefully added each time you call a function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When an exception is thrown, your whole nice Jenga tower gets destroyed, all the way up to the catch() block. The catch block can safely handle the error, but the stack is unwinded, meaning you lose all of the state you had in your program before throwing the exception. You have to build your tower again, from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using effect handlers you can actually go back to your original computation after the handler is done handling the effect. The handler can also return some values back to your program, and it can even resume multiple times with different return values. You also still have the option of not resuming at all and aborting the program — that would be the effect equivalent of exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back to the Jenga analogy: if your tower is about to fall down, with effects you can freeze it mid-collapse. You then call someone for help (handler), and they decide whether to let the tower fall, magically restore it to the previous statlte. Or even hand you different blocks to try the same move (call the continuation) again, possibly multiple times with different inputs. Your Jenga tower ends up looking more like a fork or a tree, with multiple different copies of your blocks branching out at some point from the base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this more concrete, let’s start by reproducing exceptions with effects. Here’s how a try/catch looks like in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def divide(x, y):
    try:
        return x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Division by zero!")
        return None
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the equivalent code in Flix. We first define an Exception effect and a &lt;code&gt;divide()&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff Exception {
    def throw(msg: String): Void
}

def divide(x: Int32, y: Int32): Int32 \ Exception = 
    if (y == 0) {
        Exception.throw("Division by zero!")
    } else {
        x / y
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then provide a handler for this effect somewhere, preferably close to &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        println(divide(10, 0))
    } with handler Exception {
        def throw(msg, _resume) = println("Error: ${msg}")
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this does is registers an effect called Exception with a method &lt;code&gt;throw()&lt;/code&gt;. We then perform this effect in our function when there’s an error, similar to throwing an exception in the Python version. Control is transferred to the effect handler, which then decides how to handle the exception, similar to a &lt;code&gt;catch()&lt;/code&gt; block in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice we never call &lt;code&gt;resume()&lt;/code&gt; from the handler. This results in the program being aborted, just like with exceptions. Graphically, this can be represented as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;block-beta columns 2 A["Statement 1"] space:1 B["Statement 2"] space:1 C["Statement 3"] space:1 D["Perform Effect"] space:1 space:1 E["Handle Effect"] space:1 F["Process &amp;amp; Exit"] space:1 space:1 D --&amp;gt; E style D fill:#ffcccc,color:#000 style E fill:#ccffcc,color:#000 style F fill:#ccffcc,color:#000&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far so good, but this is not much different from Python. To really take full advantage of effect handlers, we can use &lt;code&gt;resume()&lt;/code&gt; to return to the original computation and proceed from the line after the effect was performed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff ResumableException {
    def askForInput(): Int32
}

def divide(x: Int32, y: Int32): Int32 \ ResumableException = 
    if (y == 0) {
        let newY = ResumableException.askForInput();
        x / newY
    } else {
        x / y
    }

def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        println(divide(10, 0))
    } with handler ResumableException {
        def askForInput(_, resume) = {
            println("Enter a new divisor:");
            resume(5) // Or get from user input
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;block-beta columns 2 A["Statement 1"] space:1 B["Statement 2"] space:1 C["Statement 3"] space:1 D["Perform Effect"] space:1 space:1 E["Handle Effect"] space:1 F["Resume"] space:1 space:1 G["Statement 4"] space:1 H["Statement 5"] space:1 I["Complete"] space:1 D --&amp;gt; E F --&amp;gt; G style D fill:#ffcccc,color:#000 style E fill:#ccffcc,color:#000 style F fill:#ffffcc,color:#000&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I called the effect &lt;code&gt;ResumableException&lt;/code&gt; here, but it’s not really an exception anymore, because the program continues normally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point we can use this power bestowed on us by effects and handlers to roll our own Async/await:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff Async {
    def await(url: String): String
}

def fetchData(): String \ Async = 
    Async.await("https://api.example.com/data")

def processData(): String \ Async = {
    let data = fetchData();
    "processed: ${data}"
}

def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        let result = processData();
        println(result)
    } with handler Async {
        def await(url, resume) = {
            // Simulate async HTTP request
            let result = "data from ${url}";
            resume(result)
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See how easy that was? This approach also avoids function coloring, since we didn’t need to use special keywords anywhere. Here’s a graphic version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;block-beta columns 2 A["Statement 1"] space:1 B["Statement 2"] space:1 C["await operation"] space:1 space:1 H1["Start async work"] space:1 H2["⏳ Long pause..."] space:1 H3["⏳ Still waiting..."] space:1 H4["✅ Async complete"] space:1 F["Resume with result"] space:1 space:1 D["Statement 3"] space:1 E["Complete"] space:1 C --&amp;gt; H1 F --&amp;gt; D style C fill:#ffcccc,color:#000 style H1 fill:#ccffcc,color:#000 style H2 fill:#fff3cd,color:#000 style H3 fill:#fff3cd,color:#000 style H4 fill:#d1ecf1,color:#000 style F fill:#ffffcc,color:#000 style D fill:#e7f3ff,color:#000 style E fill:#d4edda,color:#000&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s cool, but we can do more. Effect handlers allow you to resume multiple times:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff Choose {
    def choose(): Int32
}

def explore(): String \ Choose = {
    let x = Choose.choose();
    let y = Choose.choose();
    "${x}, ${y}"
}

def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        println(explore())
    } with handler Choose {
        def choose(_, resume) = {
            resume(1);
            resume(2);
            resume(3)
        }
&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hopefully this gives you a taste of how effect handlers work. This is just a sketch though — you can read more on this and see examples in the Flix docs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's your primary programming language?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defining our own control flow abstractions is great, but most of the time regular async/await and/or coroutines are enough for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is extremely useful for daily programming is that effects let you separate the declaration of the effect (the operation, or the effect “constructor”) from it’s implementation, defined by the effect handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add some effect definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff Database {
    def getUser(id: Int32): Option[User],
    def saveUser(user: User): Unit
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then use these definitions to perform effects in your code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def updateUserEmail(userId: Int32, newEmail: String): Result[String, User] \ {Database} = {
    match Database.getUser(userId) {
        case Some(user) =&amp;gt; {
            let updatedUser = {user | email = newEmail};
            Database.saveUser(updatedUser);
            Ok(updatedUser)
        }
        case None =&amp;gt; {
            Err("User not found")
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This replaces the need for dependency injection, since you can provide different handlers for these database operations in production vs testing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def main(): Unit \\ IO = { // production handler, uses a real database
    run {
        updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com")
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(id, resume) = {
		        // real db query
            resume(user)
        }
        def saveUser(user, resume) = {
		        // real db query
            resume()
        }
    }
}

def testUpdateUserEmail(): Unit = { // test handler, just stubs
    let testUser = {id = 123, email = "old@example.com"};
    run {
        let result = updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com");
        assert(result == Ok({testUser | email = "new@example.com"}))
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(id, resume) = resume(Some(testUser))
        def saveUser(user, resume) = {
            assert(user.email == "new@example.com");
            resume()
        }
    
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the biggest advantage that effect handlers give is that they abstract away the patterns associated with DDD, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal architecture, etc. commonly found in enterprise code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All these architectures give you some sort of way to isolate your core logic, which should be pure, from infrastructure and app logic, with deals with external dependencies. But you have to commit to an architecture and the whole team has to be disciplined enough to stick to for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using effects encourages separating the definition of effect operations from implementation by default, meaning you don’t really need these architecture patterns anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great, since relying on team discipline exclusively rarely works. It also saves a bunch of time otherwise spent on bike shedding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effect handlers also allow you to easily install stubs, which you can use to create quick test cases without boilerplate, just by swapping handlers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def testErrorConditions(): Unit = {
    run {
        let result = updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com");
        assert(result == Err("User not found"))
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(_, resume) = resume(None) // Stub: always return None
        def saveUser(_, resume) = resume()             // Won't be called
    }
}

def testSlowDatabase(): Unit = {
    run {
        let result = updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com");
        assert(result.isOk())
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(id, resume) = {
            Thread.sleep(100);  // Simulate slow query
            resume(Some({id = id, email = "old@example.com"}))
        }
        def saveUser(user, resume) = {
            Thread.sleep(50);   // Simulate slow save
            resume()
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can even make a handler that records all interactions instead of executing them. There are many possibilities here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-World App: AI movie recommendations 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To bring this all together, let’s make a real application using effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our app will fetch some movie data from TheMovieDB, and then use an LLM to recommend some movies based on user preferences provided from the console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flix interoperates with the JVM, meaning we can call code from Java, Kotlin, Scala, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s define the two custom effects we will need: MovieAPI and LLM:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eff MovieAPI {
    def getPopularMovies(): String
}

eff LLM {
    def recommend(movies: String, preferences: String): String
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can then perform the effects in main like so, providing some basic handlers that use the Flix’s stdlib HTTP client:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def getRecommendation(preferences: String): String \ {MovieAPI, LLM} = {
    let movies = MovieAPI.getPopularMovies();
    LLM.recommend(movies, preferences)
}

def main(): Unit \ {Net, IO} = 
    run {
        let suggestion = getRecommendation("action movies");
        println(suggestion)
    } with handler MovieAPI {
        def getPopularMovies(_, resume) = {
            let response = HttpWithResult.get("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular", Map.empty());
            match response {
                case Result.Ok(resp) =&amp;gt; resume(Http.Response.body(resp))
                case Result.Err(_) =&amp;gt; resume("[]")
            }
        }
    } with handler LLM {
        def recommend(movies, prefs, resume) = {
            let prompt = "Movies: ${movies}. User likes: ${prefs}. Recommend one movie.";
            let response = HttpWithResult.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/completions", Map.empty(), prompt);
            match response {
                case Result.Ok(resp) =&amp;gt; resume(Http.Response.body(resp))
                case Result.Err(_) =&amp;gt; resume("Try watching a classic!")
            }
        }
    } with HttpWithResult.runWithIO
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that both effects are quite generic. So we can easily swap either the movie API or the LLM provider without touching anything in the core logic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Switch to different movie provider
with handler MovieAPI {
    def getPopularMovies(_, resume) = {
        let response = HttpWithResult.get("https://api.imdb.com/popular", Map.empty());
        // ... handle IMDB response format
    }
}

// Switch to different LLM provider  
with handler LLM {
    def recommend(movies, prefs, resume) = {
        let response = HttpWithResult.post("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", Map.empty(), prompt);
        // ... handle Claude response format
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get the user input we will need to include the standard Console effect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def main(): Unit \ {Net, IO} = 
    run {
        Console.println("What movie genres do you enjoy?");
        let preferences = Console.readln();
        let suggestion = getRecommendation(preferences);
        Console.println("Recommendation: ${suggestion}")
    } with handler MovieAPI { /* ... */ }
      with handler LLM { /* ... */ }
      with Console.runWithIO
      with HttpWithResult.runWithIO
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can also add some basic logs using the standard Logger effect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def getRecommendation(preferences: String): String \ {MovieAPI, LLM, Logger} = {
    Logger.info("Fetching popular movies...");
    let movies = MovieAPI.getPopularMovies();
    Logger.info("Getting LLM recommendation...");
    LLM.recommend(movies, preferences)
}

def main(): Unit \ {Net, IO} = 
    run {
        /* ... console interaction ... */
    } with handler MovieAPI { /* ... */ }
      with handler LLM { /* ... */ }
      with Console.runWithIO
      with Logger.runWithIO
      with HttpWithResult.runWithIO
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it! Let’s run the app and test it manually like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; flix run Main.flix
What movie genres do you enjoy?
&amp;gt; sci-fi horror
[INFO] Fetching popular movies...
[INFO] Getting LLM recommendation...
Recommendation: Based on your interest in sci-fi horror, I recommend "Alien" - a perfect blend of both genres!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can also easily write tests for the core logic by providing test handlers for our movie and LLM effects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def testRecommendation(): String = 
    run {
        getRecommendation("comedy")
    } with handler MovieAPI {
        def getPopularMovies(_, resume) = {
            resume("""[{"title": "The Grand Budapest Hotel", "genre": "comedy"}]""")
        }
    } with handler LLM {
        def recommend(movies, prefs, resume) = {
            resume("I recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel - perfect for comedy lovers!")
        }
    } with handler Logger {
        def log(_, _, resume) = resume()  // Silent in tests
    }

def runTests(): Unit \ IO = {
    let result = testRecommendation();
    println("Test result: ${result}")
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where to Go From Here 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read the Flix docs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Especially on cool features like effect polymorphism, effect exclusion etc. Check out code examples in the repo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join the community and contribute with libraries&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Flix compiler and stdlib are quite feature-rich at this point, and having JVM interop means you have all the essentials you need to write practical code. But there are still very few pure Flix libraries. So it’s very valuable to contribute some. The ideas I can think of are, for example, rebuilding standard things like Web frameworks in an effect oriented way,. Or taking advantage of the unique feature set in Flix to build something entirely new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explore effect-oriented programming&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I personally like Flix and can recommend it to others, there are other ways you can use effects for real-world software. If you’re in Typescript or Scala, try out Effect or ZIO/Kyo/Cats. If you’re looking for other languages that support effects natively, and you’re not afraid of Haskell-like syntax, check out Unison. They have a bunch of other concepts I find cool, like a better distributed computing model and the code being content-addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should I write about next?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extra: Why Algebraic Effects are Algebraic and how they relate to monads 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, practical people have left the room. Following sections are nerds-only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason, all the content I’ve been reading on algebraic effects uses this term a lot, but no one explains why specifically they’re called “algebraic”. So I did some digging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out, algebraic effects are “algebraic” because they can be described with laws and equations, like in algebra — the kind we learn at school. Which is I guess why they’re easier to grasp than monads — unlike algebra, you usually don’t study category theory in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the algebraic part only applies to the effect “constructors”, i.e the operations themselves like &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;put()&lt;/code&gt; for the state effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effect handlers, on the other hand, are not algebraic at all, which can be a bit confusing. But it makes sense if you think about it — the purpose of handlers is to act as “deconstructors”, interpreting our algebraic effect operations by means of things that cannot be described by algebraic equations alone, such as continuations .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, effect handlers are often (but not always) implemented via delimited continuations. There are also other, static/lexically scoped and maybe more performant approaches being explored, such as this one&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Real” algebraic effects don’t require monads. Monads and algebraic effects are two different concepts tackling similar problems. One is expressible in terms of the other, but algebraic effects are arguably more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could actually implement algebraic effects using a continuation monad. If we don’t care about types, effects are perfectly expressible with monads and vice versa&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problems appear when we introduce types into the picture. In a properly typed world, you can’t actually reproduce the same expressiveness you get with effects using monads. You’ll end up breaking the type system or reducing expressiveness at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effects are, in this sense, more “powerful” than monads with their natural type system: you can express infinitely many computations with them. E.g if you use a &lt;code&gt;tick()&lt;/code&gt; effect and you do a bunch of sequential &lt;code&gt;tick()&lt;/code&gt; s, the result will be a distinct computation each time. With monads and their natural type system the set of computations you could express is finite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, with monads you commit to a specific interpretation of an effect in advance, while effects completely decouple effect definition from it’s implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, effects are easier to compose than monads. With monad transformers you quickly hit the wall having to define a bunch of different combinations that each have distinct semantics. Effects compose naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So while effect libraries in languages like Typescript and Scala are able to express effects using monads3, and the behavior could be identical at runtime, this cannot replace having an actual type and effect system, with effects being properly typed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you usually learn about new things?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes 🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What color is your function” is a problem explored in this article. In languages which have Async baked in via special keywords (e.g JavaScript async/await) it becomes a pain to refactor and to combine synchronous and asynchronous code. If you make one function deep in the call stack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;, all the callers will have to be made Async as well, or&lt;code&gt;await()&lt;/code&gt;the results. With effects you don’t have this issue as there are no keywords and no special behavior. Async is simply done with effect handlers. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I like the grandma example more than the “launch missiles” popular in the Haskell world. Took it from this article by Kevin Mahoney. It’s somehow more offensive ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See some examples in this article. This also shows how Haskell’s new delimited continuation support can be used to implement algebraic effects and handlers ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Belling the Cat&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belling the Cat is a fable also known under the titles The Bell and the Cat and The Mice in Council. In the story, a group of mice agree to attach a bell to a cat's neck to warn of its approach in the future, but they fail to find a volunteer to perform the job. The term has become an idiom describing a group of persons, each agreeing to perform an impossibly difficult task under the misapprehension that someone else will be chosen to run the risks and endure the hardship of actual accomplishment.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although often attributed to Aesop, it was not recorded before the Middle Ages and has been confused with the quite different fable of Classical origin titled The Cat and the Mice. In the classificatory system established for the fables by Ben Edwin Perry, it is numbered 613, which is reserved for Mediaeval attributions outside the Aesopic canon.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Synopsis and idiomatic use&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The fable concerns a group of mice who debate plans to nullify the threat of a marauding cat. One of them proposes placing a bell around its neck, so that they are warned of its approach. The plan is applauded by the others, until one mouse asks who will volunteer to place the bell on the cat. All of them make excuses. The story is used to teach the wisdom of evaluating a plan on not only how desirable the outcome would be but also how it can be executed. It provides a moral lesson about the fundamental difference between ideas and their feasibility, and how this affects the value of a given plan.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fable gives rise to the idiom to bell the cat, which means to attempt, or agree to perform, an impossibly difficult task.[4] Historically 'Bell the Cat' is frequently claimed to have been a nickname given to fifteenth-century Scottish nobleman Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus in recognition of his part in the arrest and execution of James III's alleged favourite, Thomas (often misnamed as Robert) Cochrane. In fact the earliest evidence for this use is from Hume of Godscroft's history of the Douglases published in 1644,[5] and therefore is more reflective of perception of the idiom in the seventeenth century than the fifteenth.[6] In the 21st century the idiom was adopted by the investigative journalism group Bellingcat.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first English collection to attribute the fable to Aesop was John Ogilby's of 1687; in this there is a woodcut (by Francis Barlow), followed by a 10-line verse synopsis by Aphra Behn with the punning conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Councell's easily given, but the effect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Oft renders it uneasy to transact.[8]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Early versions and later interpretations&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest versions of the story appears as a parable critical of the clergy in Odo of Cheriton's Parabolae.[9] Written around 1200, it was afterwards translated into Welsh, French and Spanish. Sometime later, the story is found in the work now referred to as Ysopet-Avionnet, which is largely made up of Latin poems by the 12th century Walter of England, followed by a French version dating from as much as two centuries later. It also includes four poems not found in Walter's Esopus; among them is the tale of "The Council of the Mice" (De muribus consilium facientibus contra catum). The author concludes with the scornful comment that laws are of no effect without the means of adequately enforcing them and that such parliamentary assemblies as he describes are like the proverbial mountain in labour that gives birth to a mouse.[10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fable also appeared as a cautionary tale in Nicholas Bozon's Anglo-Norman Contes Moralisés (1320), referring to the difficulty of curbing the outrages of superior lords.[11] It was in this context too that the story of a parliament of rats and mice was retold in William Langland's allegorical poem Piers Plowman.[12] The episode is said to refer to the Parliament of 1376 which attempted unsuccessfully to remedy popular dissatisfaction over the exactions made by nobles acting in the royal name.[13] Langland's French contemporary, the satirical Eustache Deschamps, also includes the story among his other moral ballades based on fables as "Les souris et les chats".[14] It has been suggested that in this case too there is a political subtext. The poem was written as a response to the aborted invasion of England in 1386 and contrasts French dithering in the face of English aggression.[15] The refrain of Deschamps' ballade, Qui pendra la sonnette au chat (who will bell the cat) was to become proverbial in France if, indeed, it does not record one already existing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following century, the Italian author Laurentius Abstemius made of the fable a Latin cautionary tale titled De muribus tintinnabulum feli appendere volentibus (The mice who wanted to bell the cat)[16] in 1499. A more popular version in Latin verse was written by Gabriele Faerno and printed posthumously in his Fabulae centum ex antiquis auctoribus delectae (100 delightful fables from ancient authors, Rome 1564), a work that was to be many times reprinted and translated up to start of the 19th century. Titled simply "The Council of the Mice", it comes to rest on the drily stated moral that 'a risky plan can have no good result'. The story was evidently known in Flanders too, since 'belling the cat' was included among the forty Netherlandish Proverbs in the composite painting of Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1559). In this case a man in armour is performing the task in the lower left foreground.[17] A century later, La Fontaine's Fables made the tale even better known under the title Conseil tenu par les rats (II.2).[18]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mediaeval times the fable was applied to political situations and British commentaries on it were sharply critical of the limited democratic processes of the day and their ability to resolve social conflict when class interests were at stake. This applies equally to the plot against the king's favourite in 15th century Scotland and the direct means that Archibald Douglas chose to resolve the issue. While none of the authors who used the fable actually incited revolution, the 1376 Parliament that Langland satirised was followed by Wat Tyler's revolt five years later, while Archibald Douglas went on to lead a rebellion against King James. During the Renaissance the fangs of the fable were being drawn by European authors, who restricted their criticism to pusillanimous conduct in the face of rashly proposed solutions. A later exception was the Russian fabulist Ivan Krylov, whose adaptation of the story satirises croneyism. In his account only those with perfect tails are to be allowed into the assembly; nevertheless, a tailless rat is admitted because of a family connection with one of the lawmakers.[19]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There still remains the perception of a fundamental opposition between consensus and individualism. This is addressed in the lyrics of "Bell the Cat",[20] a performance put out on DVD by the Japanese rock band LM.C in 2007.[21] This is the monologue of a house cat that wants to walk alone since "Society is by nature evil". It therefore refuses to conform and is impatient of restriction: "your hands hold on to everything – bell the cat". While the lyric is sung in Japanese, the final phrase is in English. Another modernised adaptation based on this fable, that updates the moral, has been published by Patricia McKissack in her Who Will Bell the Cat? (illustrated by Christopher Cyr).[22][23]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a Tibetan proverb that is very similar, "Putting a bell on the cat's neck after the mother of mice was consulted"[24]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Illustrations&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Several French artists depicted the fable during the 19th century, generally choosing one of two approaches. Gustave Doré and the genre painter Aurélie Léontine Malbet (fl. 1868–1906)[25] pictured the rats realistically acting out their debate. The illustrator Grandville,[26] along with the contemporaries Philibert Léon Couturier (1823–1901)[27] and Auguste Delierre (1829–1890),[28] caricature the backward practice and pomposity of provincial legislatures, making much the same point as did the Mediaeval authors who first recorded the tale. At the end of the century a publishing curiosity reverts to the first approach. This was in the woodblock print by Kawanabe Kyōsui that appeared in the collection of La Fontaine's fables that was commissioned and printed in Tokyo in 1894 and then exported to France.[29] In the upper left-hand corner a cat is seen through a warehouse window as it approaches across the roofs while inside the rats swarm up the straw-wrapped bales of goods. At its summit the chief rat holds the bell aloft. An earlier Japanese woodblock formed part of Kawanabe Kyōsai's Isoho Monogotari series (1870–80). This shows an assembly of mice in Japanese dress with the proposer in the foreground, brandishing the belled collar.[30]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Musical settings&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;In the 18th century the fable was one among many set by Louis-Nicolas Clérambault in the fables section of Nouvelles poésies spirituelles et morales sur les plus beaux airs (1730–37).[31] In the following century the text of La Fontaine's fable was set for male voices by Louis Lacombe[32] and by the Catalan composer Isaac Albéniz for medium voice and piano in 1889.[33] In 1950 it was set for four male voices by Florent Schmitt.[34] But while La Fontaine's humorously named cat Rodilardus, and antiquated words like discomfiture (déconfiture), may fit an art song, there have also been faithful interpretations in the field of light music. A popular composer of the day, Prosper Massé, published such a setting in 1846.[35] More recently there has been Pierre Perret's interpretation as part of his 20 Fables inspirées de Jean de la Fontaine (1995),[36] and a jazz arrangement on Daniel Roca's 10 Fables de La Fontaine (2005).[37]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Collective action problem&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Who Will Bell the Cat?, a children's picture book based on the fable&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ Strouf, Judie L.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite is a TCL extension that has escaped into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of SQLite was inspired by the design of TCL, both in the way it handles datatypes and in the formatting of its source code. The index use case for SQLite was in a Tcl/Tk application for an industrial company. From its inception, SQLite has always depended heavily on TCL. These days, SQLite no longer uses TCL internally and can be run separately from any TCL interpreter, and yet the SQLite development process still depends heavily on TCL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite is an SQL database engine, and the most widely used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all cellphones as a core component and is the primary means of data persistence on phones. SQLite is also an integral part of most web browsers. SQLite is built into MacOS and is used by most of the default applications on that platform. Windows10 requires the C:\Windows\System32\winsqlite3.dll file in order to boot. Countless other popular applications like Skype and WhatsApp and iTunes depend on SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because SQLite is open source and can be freely downloaded and duplicated, exact usage numbers are unavailable. But reasonable estimates are that there are more SQLite instances in operation today than there are people on earth. Most devices that use the SQLite database engine contain hundreds of separate databases, and there are billions of such devices. Hence, there are likely around one trillion SQLite databases in active use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are more copies of SQLite in use than there are copies of Linux. We know this because SQLite is used on almost all Linux systems, but SQLite is also used on many other non-linux systems such as Macs, iPhones, and Windows computers. By similar arguments, there are more copies of SQLite in use than there are Macs, or Windows PCs. There are probably more copies of SQLite in use than all other database engines combined. It seems likely that SQLite is the most widely used and deployed software component of any kind, with the possible exception of the zLib compression library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite is not written in TCL. Rather, SQLite is intended to be used by TCL. Like the TCL interpreter, SQLite is written in ANSI C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that SQLite was primarily intended to be used from TCL is evident in an number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All programming languages, other than C/C++, require some kind of adaptor in order to interface with the SQLite C implementation. Language adaptors for SQLite are widely available from third party programmers. The adaptors for PHP and Python are built into those languages, for example. A Java adaptor is baked into Android. And so forth. Only the TCL adaptor is included as part of the SQLite core. The source code file that implements the TCL adaptor for SQLite, "tclsqlite.c", was part of the very first check-in on the SQLite source repository on 2000-05-29. (See https://sqlite.org/src/ci/6f3655f79f9b6fc9.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All modern SQL implementations provide a means to do late binding of parameter values to the SQL statements. Usually a naked "?" character, or a "?" followed by an integer is used. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=?1&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "?1" token in the SQL above would be assigned a value at run-time in order to look up the password and photograph of a particular user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite supports this syntax. But because of its TCL heritage, SQLite also allows the parameter to take the form of a TCL variable. Hence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=$uid&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a statement such as the above is run, the TCL language adaptor automatically binds the value of the $uid TCL variable to the SQL statement before it is evaluated, providing an intuitive and seamless interface between TCL and SQL. SQLite is the only database engine that behaves this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TCL heritage of SQLite is visible in the type system of SQLite. Early versions of SQLite (prior to 2004) operated on the classic TCL principal that "everything is a string". Beginning with SQLite3 (2004-06-18), SQLite also supports binary data. However, types are still very flexible in SQLite, just as they are in TCL. SQLite treats the datatypes on column names in a CREATE TABLE statement as suggestions rather than hard requirements. SQLite is happy to store a 100KB string value in a column that is declared "SHORT INT", just as TCL is happy to store either a large string or a small integer in the same variable. There are some differences in how SQLite deals with datatypes, in comparison to TCL, due to the different nature of the SQL language. SQLite has the concept of "type affinity". If a column is declared "INT" and one inserts a string into that column that looks like an integer and can be safely converted into an integer without loss of information, then that conversion occurs automatically. This provides a measure of compatibility with the rigid type systems of other SQL database engines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The flexible type system of SQLite seems natural and intuitive to programmers with prior experience programming in TCL. Curiously, though, it is a source of frustration and frequent complaining from programmers accustomed to the rigid and unforgiving type systems of languages like Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The similarities in the type systems of TCL and SQLite extends to more than just the interface. An important part of the C/C++ interface for SQLite is the "sqlite3_value" object (https://sqlite.org/c3ref/value.html) which is analogous to the Tcl_Obj object in TCL. Both TCL and SQLite use a dual-representation approach, where each value can be represented simultaneously as both a string and some other type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite began as a TCL extension, though these days most uses of SQLite are in applications written in languages other than TCL. Many programmers who use SQLite in their applications have no knowledge or awareness of TCL. The SQLite source code used by most developers is a single file of pure C code named "sqlite3.c" that contains no TCL code. This is what we mean when we say that SQLite as "escaped" into the wild. Deployed instances of SQLite no longer depends on TCL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, SQLite is still heavily dependent upon TCL and the ongoing support, maintenance, and enhancement of SQLite would not be possible without TCL, and would be seriously inconvenienced without Tk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deliverable source code for SQLite is a single file named "sqlite3.c" and its companion header "sqlite3.h". Both files are 100% ANSI-C code. But developers do not edit these files directly. The sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h source files are build products, and the source tree used to build those files is over 50% TCL code. Figure 1 nearby shows the exact ratios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 1 is for the main SQLite source repository. Many of the test cases and much of the documentation is held in separate repositories, not included in Figure 1. The separate repositories also contain a great deal of TCL code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of the TCL code in the main SQLite repository consists of test scripts. At this writing, the core repository contains 1153 separate test scripts totally about 389 KB of space. But this is not the only use of TCL in SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A non-trivial amount of the deliverable C code for SQLite is machine generated. Some of the machine generated code is created by C programs, such as LEMON which translates the SQL language grammar into C code to implement a push-down automaton to parse the SQL language. But much of the automatically generated code is created using TCL scripts. TCL is well suited for scanning source files to extract information to be merged with other files and for making mechanized edits. For example, the byte-code engine used to evaluate SQL statements inside of SQLite is implemented as a large "switch" statement inside a "for" loop, with a separate "case" for each opcode, all in the "vdbe.c" source file. At build-time, TCL scripts scan the vdbe.c source file looking for the appropriate "case" statements and then build header files that assign consecutive integers to each symbolic opcode name. (The opcodes used by the SQLite byte-code engine are not an API as they are in TCL and thus can change from one build to the next.) This mapping of symbolic opcode names into integers is not a simple as one might suppose. For reasons of optimization, there are many constraints on the specific values that are assigned to opcodes. For example, many opcodes such as OP_Add must have the same numeric value as the corresponding "+" token in the SQL language parser. Sometimes a group of related opcodes, such as the comparison operators OP_Eq, OP_Ne, OP_Lt, OP_Le, OP_Ge, and OP_Gt, need to be assigned consecutive integers in a specific order. These constraints are all handled effortlessly in TCL. Accomplishing the same with AWK would be rather more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important task for TCL during the SQLite build process is constructing the SQLite amalgamation source code file. Recall that most developers use SQLite in the form of a single big file of C code named "sqlite3.c" and referred to as "the amalgamation". A TCL script named "mksqlite3c.tcl" runs in order to construct the amalgamation from over one hundred separate input files. Each of these inputs files must be added to the amalgamation in just the right order. Furthermore, the source files are edited as part of the amalgamation building process. When mksqlite3c.tcl encounters a "#include" for an SQLite header, it replaces the "#include" with a copy of that header file, taking care to make sure each header file is only included once. The mksqlite3.tcl script automatically adds the "static" keyword to internal SQLite APIs to give them file linkage, and makes other similar edits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the core SQLite library, the SQLite source tree also contains code for several analysis and control programs. One of these programs is called "sqlite3_analyzer" (or "sqlite3_analyzer.exe" on Windows). The sqlite3_analyzer program examines an SQLite database and generates a detailed report on the disk usage by the various tables and indexes within that database. The sqlite3_analyzer program is very useful in understanding how an application is using disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that sqlite3_analyzer, though disguised as an ordinary executable, is really a TCL application. The main source code file for this application is tool/spaceanal.tcl. During the build process, this script is converted into a C-language string constant (using another TCL script) and added to a very simple C-language wrapper than starts a TCL interpreter and then passes the application script to that interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sqlite3_analyzer program could be rewritten in pure C. But that would be a lot of code. The TCL script that implements sqlite3_analyzer is less than 1000 lines long. The equivalent C program would surely be at least ten times larger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that the sqlite3_analyzer utility program statically links a TCL interpreter and so does not require a TCL installation on the target computer to use. The sqlite3_analyzer utility program is used by tens of thousands of developers, most of whom do not realize that they are really running a TCL application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the key features of SQLite is that it uses aviation-grade testing. The tests of SQLite, at a minimum, provide 100% modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) of the SQLite code, with independence. 100% MC/DC roughly means that every branch instruction at the machine code level is exercised at least once in each direction. The precise definition of MC/DC is slightly stricter than this, for example when comparing boolean vectors, but the 100% branch tests coverage definition is very close approximation. The "with independence" term means that SQLite is tested in multiple ways with test code being written and maintained by different individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amount of testing done on SQLite is fanatical. On the other hand, that level of testing is necessary for a fundamental low-level component, such as a database engine, that is used by billions of devices. If an ordinary application encounters an obscure bug, it can normally be rebooted to clear the problem. But the job of a database engine is to remember things, and so databases tend to remember their mistakes across reboots. For these reasons, it is important that SQLite have a very low bug density.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TCL is used in every aspect of SQLite testing. The test cases that are part of the primary SQLite source code repository are written in TCL. Other test cases such as TH3 and SQLLogicTest are written in C but still depend on TCL for operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TH3 test suite is a set of proprietary tests for SQLite that form the primary means of achieving 100% MC/DC. TH3 is designed to run on embedded hardware without the support of a desktop operating system. TH3 consists of over 1350 test modules together with over 100 control files. The test modules are written in either C or SQL or a combination of both. The control files are text formatted in a way that easily parsed by TCL. To build a TH3 test, a TCL script is run that combines some subset of the test modules and control files into a single large C program that will automatically run the required tests. This C program is then linked against the "sqlite3.c" amalgamation and the resulting binary is moved to the target computer and executed. TCL scripts automate this entire process on all major host platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To verify that the TH3 tests really do provide 100% MC/DC, special options are added to the TCL scripts that run the tests, causing the GCC coverage analysis tools to be invoked. The output of gcov is then postprocessed to reveal and report any branch instructions that were missed by the tests. The TH3 tests themselves are all implemented in C and SQL, but the operation and management of those tests is all done with TCL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extensive documentation for SQLite available on the SQLite website (https://sqlite.org/) is all generated by TCL. Many of the documents, such as the API reference documentation and the descriptions of the byte-code engine opcodes, are created by TCL scripts that scan C source code and extract the necessary information from the code and comments. Thus, the API documentation is largely derived from comments in the source code. Keeping the official documentation (in comments) and the source code close together helps ensure that they are in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other whitepaper documents are generated from source files that look mostly like HTML but which contain additional TCL code embedded inside of &amp;lt;tcl&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/tcl&amp;gt; markup. The added TCL code is used for advanced formatting techniques, for automatically creating cross-references and cross-links, and for constructing complex displays such as the popular "rail-road" syntax diagrams for SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The text editor used by the primary author of SQLite is a custom editor with emacs-style key bindings that is built on top of the Tk Text widget. The "e" editor, as it is called, is cross-platform, which helps in the development of a cross-platform software library like SQLite. The "e" editor has been used for the entire 17-year history of SQLite. It has been enhanced over the years with various customizations created especially to help manage the SQLite source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fossil version control system used for the SQLite source code (and written specifically for that purpose) uses Tcl/Tk to show graphical side-by-side diffs in a separate window. When the "fossil diff --tk" command is run, Fossil generates a script to show the diff graphically and then kicks off a separate "wish" process to run that script and display the diff in a separate window. This graphical diff window has a "Save" button which will cause the Tcl/Tk code needed to reproduce itself to be written to a file. This file can be, in turn, sent to a collaborator for display. Passing around graphical diffs as ordinary text files is much simpler and easier than passing around JPEG images or text "context" diffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No two SQLite developers work in the same office. The team is geographically distributed. To help the team stay in touch, a custom chatroom has been created using a Tcl/Tk script. The same script works as both client and server. The chatroom is private and uses a proprietary protocol, so that developers are free to discuss sensitive matters without fear of eavesdropping. The chatroom is implemented as just over 1000 lines of Tk code, and is thus accessible and easy to customize. Among the customizations is the ability to send saved "fossil diff --tk" graphical diffs to collaborators and have the diff pop automatically on the collaborators screen. Small features like this seem trivial by themselves, but together than help the developers to work much more efficiently. These kinds of productivity-enhancing features are unavailable to users of commercial business collaboration packages such as HipChat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite is an indispensable element of most modern computer systems, and TCL is an indispensable tool used in the production and maintenance of SQLite. Thus, the computing infrastructure we enjoy today would not exist except for TCL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As deployed, SQLite contains no TCL code. However, the design of SQLite is inspired by TCL. And TCL is used extensively in the code generation, testing, analysis, documentation, and development of SQLite. Without TCL, SQLite would not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every developer and every team has a finite number of "brain cycles" available to do their job. The fewer cycles spent messing with tools, the more cycles are available to devote towards solving the problem. So for maximum productivity, it is important to use tools that get the job done with a minimum of fuss and bother. Our 17-year experience using TCL in the SQLite project has convinced us that TCL is just such a tool. Tcl provides the most help per brain cycle of any similar technology.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Keeping Secrets Out of Logs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is about how to keep secrets out of logs, and my claim is that (like many things in security) there isn’t a singular action or silver bullet that lets you do this. I would go so far as to say that there’s not even an 80/20 rule, where one action fixes 80% of the problem. It’s not like preventing SQL injection with prepared statements or preventing buffer overflows by using memory-safe languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I will offer instead, are lead bullets, of which there are many. I’m going to talk about 10 of them. They are imperfect and sometimes unreliable things that, if put in the right places and with defense-in-depth, can still give us a real good chance at succeeding. My hope is that by the end, you’ll have a slightly better framework for how to reason about this problem and some new ideas to add to your kit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Table of contents:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that, let’s dive in and set the table by talking about the problem with secrets in logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, there are some problems that are annoying. And there are some problems that are difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is both. I’m gonna level with you: I absolutely hate this problem. But I’m not going to gaslight you and tell you that this is the most important thing to work on worry about, because it probably isn’t!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have somewhere between 5 and 50 other problems in your backlog that seem more important, 1 of which you found out about this morning. But I think it’s likely that none of those problems are nearly as annoying. While researching this topic, I interviewed about a dozen other engineers and, on this point, they unanimously agreed! Nobody likes dealing with secrets in logs because it is extraordinarily annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a problem that’s also difficult, but not even in the fun sense, like being technically complex or interesting. Once you catch sensitive data in logs, it’s usually pretty straightforward (at least in retrospect) to determine how they got there. But, it’s also surprisingly elusive to prevent, and it crops up in incredibly unexpected places and ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secrets could mean lots of different things to lots of different teams, but I’ll use it interchangeably with “sensitive data”: stuff that you want to keep confidential. What’s so frustrating when breaching confidentiality in logs is the full spectrum of potential impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the best case (left), you might log an isolated, internal credential, like an API key, which (kudos!) you rotate right after fixing the source of leak. The impact is minimal, and you just move on. Of course, all the way on the other end of the spectrum (right), you might log something that an attacker or inside threat could use to do some real harm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then somewhere in-between, where I suspect most of the incidents lie. You might log secrets that you unfortunately, can’t rotate yourself. Things like PII or your customer’s passwords, which are reused on other sites, because of course they are. And, depending on your policies, threat model, or regulations, you might choose to issue a disclosure or notification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it is painful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could be doing so many good data security practices, like secure-by-design frameworks, database and field-level encryption, zero-touch production, access control&amp;amp;mldr; but logging bypasses all of that&amp;amp;mldr; and ultimately degrades trust, in your systems and in your company. It feels unfair because it’s only a fraction of your security story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is a problem that happens to companies of all sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something about “plaintext” just kinda stings, especially as a security practitioner. It’s like&amp;amp;mldr; the most profane insult you can hurl at a security engineer. Imagine retorting with, “Oh yea? Well, you store your passwords in plaintext!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But logging passwords and storing them in plaintext are&amp;amp;mldr; kinda the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because while logs are rarely or purposefully public, they’re typically afforded broader access than direct access to your databases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone knows by now that storing plaintext secrets in your database is a terrible idea. Logs, however, are still data-at-rest, and we should treat them with the same level of scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I cherry picked those examples because they are established companies with very mature security programs. I’m not trying to throw shade; in fact, I deeply respect them for being public and transparent about this. I think this also hints that preventing secrets in logs is a deceptively difficult and frustrating problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we can understand some causes, we might gain a deeper appreciation for these past occurrences, and stand a better chance at avoiding new incidents in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Causes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is certainly not comprehensive, but from my interviews and personal experience, here are six of the most common causes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🤦 Direct logging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const temp = res.cookie["session"];

// TODO: remove after testing is done
Logger.info("session HERE", { temp });
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Narrator: it was not removed after testing was done&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first group is perhaps the most obvious and facepalm one: when sensitive data is directly logged. Sometimes it’s purely accidental, like the example above: someone wants to debug session cookies in their local environment and then&amp;amp;mldr; accidentally commits the code. Sometimes it comes from an uninformed position where the developer just doesn’t know any better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tend to be fairly easy to trace down the exact line of code or commit that introduces it. With this example, you can just grep the codebase for &lt;code&gt;session here&lt;/code&gt; and you’ll find it instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🚰 Kitchen sinks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const client = googleSdk.admin(...);
try {
  const res = client.tokens.list(...);
} catch (e) {
  Logger.error("failed fetch", { e });
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’ve seen or written code like this before. Here we have an API client or SDK that is used to fetch some data. Exceptions are caught, kind of, and then promptly logged so that on-call engineers can debug the errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That error is decorated with a config object stuffed with secrets and the full response object, which is also stuffed with secrets, and now they’re both in your logs!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  e: {
    status: 400,
    ...
    config: { 💥☠️🪦 },
    response: { 💣😭😱 },
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I call these “kitchen sinks,” objects that contain or hold secrets, often in opaque or unexpected ways. Think of an actual kitchen sink that’s filled to the brim with dirty dishes and you can’t easily tell what’s at the bottom without reaching into it. Maybe it’s a spoon, or maybe it’s knife and now you have to go to the hospital. What tends to happen is that the whole kitchen sink gets logged, and the logging library happily serializes it, including parts that were actually sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seems to happen with code that attaches additional data onto errors, or code that logs full request and response objects. It’s typically a bit hard to catch in code review unless you know to look for them. If you are blessed with static types, seeing an &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type flow into logs can be a good hint that you’re
logging too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🔧 Configuration changes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Narrator: it was not okay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next example: someone needs additional observability and changes a setting like the global log level. You know exactly what happens, here. This dev is about to have a bad time and find out that hope, in fact, is not a valid strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started with an observability problem. Now we also have security problem: brand new secrets are getting emitted into logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that example (that totally never happened to me ever), developers built production around log levels set to &lt;code&gt;WARN&lt;/code&gt; and above, but once you flip it to
&lt;code&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt;, all this new stuff comes out of the woodwork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These type of configuration changes tend to involve a system that was built with one set of assumptions, but some kind of modification moves that system from a known state into a unknown state, introducing a new set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These often involve low-level or global utilities like logging config, HTTP middleware, or some central piece of infra like a load balancer. They tend to be singletons that are difficult or costly to test, or they crop up only at runtime. On the positive side, it’s usually loud and quick to patch, but cleanup can be kinda painful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🥧 Embedded secrets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;app.get("/login/:slug", async (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  const magicLink = req.params["slug"];
  await login({ magicLink });
});
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I completely made up this phrase, but the idea is that secrets are coupled to, embedded into, and baked into more general formats like URLs or remote procedure calls. The central idea is that it’s designed into the format and the system, and can’t easily be separated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say you have a magic login link handler (see above) where a user can click a link and sign into a web app. There’s nothing in that code that logs the link, but if you look at HTTP logs, it’s right there in plain view:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;47.29.201.179 - - [17/Jul/2024:13:17:10 +0000] "GET /login/Uj79z1pe01...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These types of leaks arise from fundamental designs that don’t take logging into consideration or incorrectly assume some end-to-end flow. The sensitivity gets lost out of context, and ends up getting logged in another layer, system, or service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;📡 Telemetry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;try:
    db_name = os.getenv("DB_NAME")
    db_pass = os.getenv("DB_PASS") # 🤫 Secret!
    conn = db.connect(db_name, db_pass)
    ...
except Error as e:
    # Don't log e! Not today!!11
    Logger.error("failed to connect")
finally:
    conn.close()
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next example: we have some Python code that’s connecting to a database, we’re specifically NOT logging the error object, and we want to ensure we always close out the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can &lt;code&gt;db_pass&lt;/code&gt; possibly make it into logs? Telemetry!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Oops, that's a log, too!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that things like error monitoring and analytics can totally be logs, too. I kind of cheated in the code example, because there’s no mention of telemetry in it at all, but it turns out that if you hook it up to error monitoring like Sentry (above), run-time errors send the local variable context right to the dashboard, and you can see the database password in plaintext.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These causes tend to bypass the central logging pipeline and become Yet Another Place to have to worry about secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🕺🏻 User input&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, last example. Say there’s a sign in form and the entire dev team made super duper sure that the password field is totally locked down from logging, they read this super awesome post, and took care of all the causes we discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users end up jamming passwords into the username field!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you ever looked at login alerts for AWS and saw usernames replaced with &lt;code&gt;HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS&lt;/code&gt;, this is precisely why!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything that’s within proximity to sensitive user input tends to be radioactive. It could be a UI issue, but users are surprisingly determined to volunteer secrets in ways that you haven’t prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve touched on a half dozen causes, and the list of things goes on. We didn’t even talk about the wonder that is crashdumps. But, I think it’s important to zoom out and note that these are proximate causes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I stand by my claim that there’s no silver bullet to take these all out. If we want to avoid playing whack-a-mole, we must bring out our lead bullets that address these issues at a deeper level, and prevent these kinds of things from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fixes (lead bullets)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s dive in! We will survey 10 fixes, and the order we’ll go in is somewhere between “a dependency graph of things that build on each other” and “following the lifecycle of a secret.” Some of these are obvious or perhaps things you’re already doing, so I’ll focus more on fixes that I think might be a bit newer. That said, it is worth starting with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;📐 Data architecture&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🍞 Data transformations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🪨 Domain primitives&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🎁 Read-once objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🗃️ Log formatters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🧪 Unit tests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🕵️ Sensitive data scanners&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🤖 Log pre-processors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🔎 Taint checking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🦸 People&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;📐 Data architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lead bullet #1 is the most basic and high-level: data architecture and understanding that this is primarily a data flow problem. And part of the solution is reducing the number of data flows and shrinking the problem space so you simply have less things to worry about and protect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of stray print statements or components that write directly to filesystem, you instead centralize all your data flows through a single stream. Make it so that there’s one and only one way to log something. If you can understand and control the data structures that enter that funnel, you can prohibit secrets from exiting it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has the allure of being a silver bullet, because of course if you can get to 100% of all the things we mentioned here, you’re golden! But in practice (and as we’ve seen previously), that’s difficult because secrets find a way to sneak in or new outflows and side channels are created.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🍞 Data transformations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The previous bullet was about controlling how data flows through your system, this is about transforming, slicing, and disarming that data into safer forms that can be logged. These are the data security fundamentals that you’re already familiar with and likely already doing. This is your bread and butter, so I’m not going to dive into every one. From top to bottom, this is generally arranged from awesome to meh&amp;amp;mldr; basically, by how much information is retained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Transformation&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Result&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Minimization&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;☁ (nothing)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Redaction&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[redacted]&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tokenization&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2706a40d-3d1d&amp;amp;mldr;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Hashing&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;daadfab322b59&amp;amp;mldr;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Encryption&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;AzKt7vBE7qEuf&amp;amp;mldr;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Masking&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;··········&lt;code&gt;5309&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the top, we have data minimization. The best way to not log secrets, is to not have secrets to begin with! This is everything from going passwordless to fetching only the data you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redaction is the next best thing. Blanking out the secret parts and before you pass objects around in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tokenization, hashing, encryption: these all have their pros, cons, and caveats. Like&amp;amp;mldr; are you even doing it correctly?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dead last is masking. You leave parts of the secret intact. Maybe this works for you. Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe you go straight to jail 🤷&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When these techniques work, they generally work well. But very often what happens is that they aren’t used or are used too late, after something is already logged. These have their places in our toolbox, but my claim again is one bullet isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🪨 Domain primitives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s introduce lead bullet #3: domain primitives. Almost all the secrets you run across in codebases are encoded in-memory as string primitives, and I think that makes our jobs harder. Strings can be almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strings: any sequence of bytes from&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;""&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;"c̴̞̑ť̸͈̘̌ h̸͝ ̭̘̊ü̶̜̫̦̠͋̆͠ ļ̵̮̤̟̉̀͂ṹ̴̝̂🤷867-53-0999"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const secret = "..."
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s very little about them——at compile time or run-time——that lets you know that it’s sensitive, dangerous to log, or somehow different than any other vanilla string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternative is a concept I learned from the book Secure by Design, and I think it’s one of the most powerful concepts you can add to your codebase, for logs or anything else where you want to layer in security at a fundamental level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Domain primitives: “combines secure constructs and value objects to define the smallest building block of a domain”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const secret = new Secret("...")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You use them as basic building blocks that hold secret values, and they provide security invariants and guarantees that basic string primitives simply cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s one of the easiest things you can do. If you shift from “any string can be a secret” to “secrets are secrets”, it makes things a lot easier to reason about and protect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Compile-time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use these to great advantage at compile-time, giving developers immediate feedback right in their editors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can type a logging function (&lt;code&gt;log()&lt;/code&gt;) so that it never accepts secrets.
Then, we use some fetching function that returns secrets, typed as secrets (and
not as strings). If we try to log that secret, it will not compile. The type
system will not let you log this secret.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Types
declare const brand: unique symbol;
type Secret = string &amp;amp; { [brand]: string }; // Branded type that extends string
type NotSecret&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; = T extends Secret ? never : T; // Type that excludes secrets

// Logging function
function log&amp;lt;T extends string&amp;gt;(message: NotSecret&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;) { ... };
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const message: string = "this is fine"; // 🧵 string primitive
const secretz: Secret = getSecret();    // 👈 domain primitive

log(message); // 👌 compiles!
log(secretz); // 💥 error!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;See this example in the TypeScript Playground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m omitting and glossing over a ton of details here, because I don’t want you to focus on the implementation or even TypeScript, for that matter. The salient point here is that instead of tossing secret strings around, you brand them as secret types, providing useful context to both compiler and developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Run-time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s really easy to get started, even with code that is functionally a no-op. This is basically the simplest form I can think of—an almost empty class:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class OpenAIToken extends String { /* that could be it! */ }

const token = new OpenAIToken(...);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s supposed to represent OpenAI credentials, but it’s just using and extending basic language primitives. You can introduce these objects where secrets originate, like password fields or anytime you decrypt sensitive data fetched from the database. And then layer in behaviors and invariants for where they tend to end up. You progressively start introducing these at both sources and sinks, allowing you to control where secrets should or shouldn’t go. You can embed these into data structures so you know what contains secrets. And along the way, you increase the clarity and safety of your codebase: not only can you prevent these tokens from going into logs, you can make sure you’re sending them only to OpenAI and not to some other API by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think in the long run, domain primitives are the most powerful control we have because it makes our code secure by design, but it does take some time to get there. These can easily address the direct logging cause we discussed earlier, and with some modifications can help with many more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Run-time: part deux&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can extend this and make it so that the default serialization behavior is redaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Secret extends String {
    toString() { return "[redacted]" } // Override!
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const secret = new Secret("shhh!");
console.log(secret);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Secret: "[redacted]"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you try to stuff this into logs, into JSON, into kitchen sinks, into error monitoring, wherever, it’ll always spit out the word “redacted”. You have to intentionally reach for the value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take it further. We can create a custom class with an explicit &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt;
function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Secret&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {
    constructor(private readonly value: T) {}
    toString() { return "[redacted]" } // Override serialization
    unwrap() { return this.value }     // Explicit getter function
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s so many things you can do here, like maybe you want to encrypt or zero it out in memory, because that’s in your threat model. You can take this as far as you need to or are comfortable with. We’ll take it just one step further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🎁 Read-once objects&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a bit to unpack here, but these build off domain primitives in a very powerful way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Secret&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {
    private locked = false;
    constructor(private readonly value: T) {}
    toString() { return "[redacted]" }

    /* @returns the sensitive value (once and only once) */
    unwrap() {
        if (this.locked) { throw new Error("already read") }
        this.locked = true;
        return this.value;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These objects wrap and keep the secret safe, until you actually need it. The code in the &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt; function is the crux: there’s a latch or
lock that activates after the secret is retrieved the first time. It goes into a
“locked” state, and any following reads result in an error that fails loudly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const secret = getSecret();
const res = await authenticate(secret.unwrap()); // Proper usage

Logger.info(secret);          // [redacted]
Logger.info(secret.unwrap()); // 💥 Error!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you get a secret (from user input, database, decryption, etc.) you wrap it in a read-once object immediately and keep it wrapped for as long as you can. And for its single, intended purpose, like using it for some kind of API authentication, you unwrap the value, use it, and then the object stays locked for good. This is surprisingly effective at preventing and detecting unintentional use. It addresses and disarms many of the proximate causes that we discussed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This object pairs extremely well with static analysis. Tools like CodeQL or Semgrep can help ensure that developers aren’t bypassing any safety guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are generally high signal, especially when you have good unit test coverage. One drawback is that read-once objects, if handled incorrectly but not necessarily unsafely, could cause errors at run-time. But I think the tradeoffs are usually worth it, especially if you complement it with testing, static analysis, and taint-checking. Speaking of which&amp;amp;mldr;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🔎 Taint checking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like to think of taint checking as static analysis with superpowers. I absolutely love it and the first time I used it, it was like someone just handed me a lightsaber. Quick review for the uninitiated: the general idea here is that you add taint to various sources (like database objects), and yell loudly if the data flows into certain sinks (like logs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The red data flow trace on the right detects the secret flowing into logs. But the green path is fine, because the secret is tokenized. Let’s walk through a quick example: semgrep.dev/playground/s/4bq5L&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the left, we’ve marked a couple sources like decrypt and a database fetcher. We’ve also marked our logger as a sink, and the &lt;code&gt;tokenize()&lt;/code&gt; function as a
sanitizer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On the right in red, we can see that taint was created from the decrypt function, propagated through the &lt;code&gt;getSSN()&lt;/code&gt;function, and then flagged for going into the logs on line 18.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In blue, there’s a much shorter path where the user model from the database is tainted and then flagged for going into logs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And then lastly, in green, we’re tokenizing the decrypted SSN, so it’s not flagging that it’s logged.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea that this is checking millions or more different data flows is the real magic part for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Awesome&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the strengths of taint analysis: obviously automation. Tracing these data flows is 100% a job for a machine. This can really help with domain primitives but also can be used standalone and can even key in on heuristics like variable names: for example, all variables containing “password”. You can tie this into all of your critical tools, from code review to CI/CD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is especially potent against kitchen sinks and embedded secrets, because those data structures can be tainted by secret values and checked accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Not awesome&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some personal opinions on drawbacks: I do feel like taint checking rules tend to be a bit difficult to write. I really, really like Semgrep, but I’m also not the biggest fan of YAML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also turns out that data flow analysis is an NP-hard problem so for large codebases and monorepos, you likely can’t run full taint analysis on every pull request or commit. Because it runs in CI/CD and as part of change management, when it works, it can prevent the introduction of insecure logging into the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, like all of the lead bullets we’ve discussed and will discuss, they can miss. How can we handle that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🗃️ Log formatters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say we made the mistake of logging too much data with our email service:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  tenantId: "52902156-7fb6-4ab0-b659-6b07b80cf89a",
  email: {
    subject: "Log in to your account",
    html: '&amp;lt;a href="https://acme.com/login/98fPm..."&amp;gt;Click here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to log in!',
    from: "AcmeCorp &amp;lt;[email protected]&amp;gt;",
    to: "Darth Plagueis (The Wise) &amp;lt;[email protected]&amp;gt;",
    ...
  },
  response: {
    status: 200,
    originalRequest: {
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIi..."
      },
      body: '{"html": "&amp;lt;a href=\\"https://acme.com/login/98fP...\\"&amp;gt;Click..."}',
      ...
    }
    ....
  },
  ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a couple of our usual suspects here. Because we’re logging email contents, magic links show up in logs&amp;amp;mldr; twice! We’re also logging some kitchen sinks, like email metadata and the original request, so we have PII and authorization headers also in logs. But because this data is structured, if we can traverse these objects, it turns out that we can zero in on these leaks quite effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  tenantId: "52902156-7fb6-4ab0-b659-6b07b80cf89a",
  email: {
    subject: "Log in to your account",
    html: '&amp;lt;a href="https://acme.com/login/REDACTED"&amp;gt;Click here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to log in!',
    from: "AcmeCorp &amp;lt;[email protected]&amp;gt;",
    to: "REDACTED",
    ...
  },
  response: {
    status: 200,
    originalRequest: {
      headers: "REDACTED",
      body: '{"html": "&amp;lt;a href=\\"https://acme.com/login/REDACTED\\"&amp;gt;..."}',
      ...
    }
    ....
  },
  ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we can introspect these objects, we can scan for dangerous substrings like our login links, and then drop or redact them. Or we can drop whole values, if we know that certain paths like &lt;code&gt;email.to&lt;/code&gt; are particularly dangerous. Fields like
&lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;headers&lt;/code&gt; tend to be risky objects that we can also remove. We can
even drop the whole log object if it doesn’t meet some admission criteria,
or—we can simply error out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, how and where do we deploy something like this? Most application loggers should have some type of middleware stack or pipeline, kinda like here on the right. These are typically configured for operations like converting objects into JSON, turning error objects into readable formats, or enriching logs by inserting useful context like network information. We can invert that, and instead of enriching with useful data, we can remove or redact sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export const logger = createLogger({
  format: format.combine(
    transform(),
    handleErrors(),
    enrich(),

      redact(), // 👈 insert here!

    truncate(),
    jsonify(),
    ...
  ),
  ...
});
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a type of guardrail that helps catch many of the common problems we described previously, like request headers or config objects. I’ve used this with decent success and found that it works best as a rifle instead of a shotgun. Because it’s at the application tier, you can customize it for the type of data or context that each application handles. For example, we can make it so that any of our domain primitives that reach this layer are quickly detected and removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is extremely cheap to introduce, but there are some trade-offs. It’s certainly more of a safety net than hard control, and a developer determined to bypass it, can and will. Steady state, I measured this at less than 1% of clock time, but there are some deeply unfortunate ways this can go wrong such as poorly written regexes and self-ReDoS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More or less, these risks can be mitigated with solid unit-testing. Which leads us to&amp;amp;mldr;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🧪 Unit tests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lead bullet #7: hooking into and using the existing test suite—that’s already there—to our advantage. We can use several of the tools we discussed, but instead of simply detecting or redacting secrets, we can ramp up the sensitivity in our test environment to fail or error loudly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Technique&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Prod&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Test&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;🪨 Domain primitives&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Redact&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Error&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;🎁 Read-once objects&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Error&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Error&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;🗃️ Log formatters&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Redact&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Error&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;🕵️ Sensitive data scanners&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Detect&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Error&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll cover sensitive data scanners next, but many test suites are already set up to capture &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stderr&lt;/code&gt;, and so you can even point your scanners to
these capture buffers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The takeaway here is that you can reap the same benefits of CI/CD and change management by catching unsafe code before it’s merged or deployed, but of course, you’re also dependent on coverage and if the right code and data paths are exercised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🕵️ Sensitive data scanners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are fairly blunt but effective tools that can discover and remove sensitive data. I’m actively going to avoid diving deep here, because it does seem like many teams and vendors focus on this as the solution. So instead, I’d like to pose a few questions that might help you reason about trade-offs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where and when in your logging pipeline is it most effective?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is it a gate, in-line of the critical path, or does it scan asynchronously?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do you simply want to detect or do you bias towards masking and redaction? How will your team handle and deal with false positives?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How far do the general, out-of-box rules take you? Can you tailor it specifically to your usage patterns?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can you verify the credentials? Can that even keep up with log throughput?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And then perhaps what tends to be the long pole in the tent: what are the costs, and can you sample instead?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think these tools tend to be better suited for defense-in-depth, because they presume that secrets made it into logs to begin with. They can help catch the more elusive causes we discussed like configuration changes or user input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Sampling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A very brief segue into sampling. Logs tend to have a kind of power law distribution, where certain types of logs vastly outnumber others. And typically what you see is that log sources have static points in code, generally with the same type of data running through them. And so within each log type, scanning and finding a single true positive might be highly representative of that group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so you might run into a scenario where, given some global sample rate, you’re wasting a lot of work for high frequency logs and not even scanning lower frequency logs. I think a better alternative to a global sample rate is to aggregate logs by some heuristic like type or origin, and to ensure you hit some minimum threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, I’ve found this difficult or impossible to configure with out-of-box solutions. I’ve had to introduce additional infrastructure to help. And that’s our next lead bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🤖 Log pre-processors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second to last lead bullet, #9: log pre-processors. These sit between apps that emit logs, and the final data stores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the above example, something like Vector can receive and process logs from our microservices before dispatching them to DataDog or wherever logs end up. We can configure it to drop sensitive data in-place using many of the techniques we discussed before. And we can sample some subset of them and store them onto an S3 bucket, using a more powerful tool like Trufflehog or an LLM to catch and verify secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea here is to process logs streams before they’re persisted. It doesn’t need to be Vector, chances are, you already have this existing infrastructure that’s used for deduping, aggregation, and dropping noisy debug logs. We can re-use it to prevent and detect secrets in logs. This pairs very well with sensitive data scanners that we discussed earlier, and might even unlock new ones you thought were out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🦸 People&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Human practitioners are the adaptable element of complex systems. Practitioners and first line management actively adapt the system to maximize production and minimize accidents.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;-Richard Cook, https://how.complexsystems.fail/#12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our last stop is people. Modern software is a complex system. And while people will write the code that accidentally introduces sensitive data into logs, they’re also the ones that will report, respond, and fix them. They’ll build out the systems and infrastructure that will keep these complex systems safe. And early on in your maturity story and before you’re able to build out secure-by-design frameworks, this is the lead bullet you’ll most likely use the most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important message I want to convey here is that your security team isn’t alone, especially if you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;educate your teammates on secure logging design&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;empower them to report and address these issues&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and equip them with tools that get out of their way and helps them succeed.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Recap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, so we’ve covered lead bullets that protect code, protect data, and protect logs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;📐 Data architecture&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🍞 Data transformations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🪨 Domain primitives&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🎁 Read-once objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🗃️ Log formatters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🧪 Unit tests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🕵️ Sensitive data scanners&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🤖 Log pre-processors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🔎 Taint checking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🦸 People&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of these might work for you, some of these won’t, and some that we haven’t even mentioned could be a homerun for you. Maybe you have super tight control over your log schemas or maybe you’re using LLMs in a really neat and effective way. Or maybe you’re building or using a language that has first class support for controlling secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These worked for me. I have some personal opinions on ones which are foundational, some that are powerful in the long-run, and some that are really easy to get started. But your story is different, so I’d like to zoom out and close out with a high-level, methodical strategy that you can apply for your security programs, and that we’ll apply and walk through with an example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a general strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lay the foundation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Understand the data ﬂow&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Protect at chokepoints&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apply defense-in-depth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plan for response and recovery&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not shooting for a Nobel, here. You’re probably doing some of these already, and chances are, you have some type of playbook or process that looks just like this. The key idea here is to not miss the forest for the trees, and use these explicit steps to place our efforts where they’ll matter most. I’ll walk you through a hypothetical system and we’ll apply these in order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;0. Lay the foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step zero is the foundation. Table stakes. This is like the base tier of Maslow’s hierarchy, and we need these before we try anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing expectations, culture, and support is a must-have. They’re easy to ignore or forget about, but can make or break success. If you work at place that hasn’t addressed these in the past, it can be quite jarring or difficult to shift that mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t have a ton of advice here other than making sure your org is aligned on this. It’ll probably feel like it’s getting worse before it’s getting better, but that is a sign of progress. A great litmus test for a solid foundation is if developers will (or already have) come to you to report secrets they found in logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second thing we’ll need is to decide is what we consider a secret to begin with. I, admittedly, used secrets and sensitive data interchangeably. This may not be the case for you. It doesn’t need to be perfect or comprehensive, and maybe it’s just a framework. But employees, especially the security team, need common understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third item is technical. If our logs aren’t structured or aren’t JSON, it’ll make this endeavor a lot more difficult. A lot of the techniques we discussed just won’t work. If we don’t have that central pipeline or there isn’t One and Only One Way to both dispatch and view logs, we’ll have to do a lot more lifting. We’ve seen a few ways that logs bypass this, but having a central pipeline should cover most of the bases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Understand the data flow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the foundation laid, the next best thing to do is to understand and chart out how secrets flow through your system. This is basically a Data Flow Diagram, and we’ll go through a fairly modest example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the left, we have users that visit some type of single-page web app. Requests and data flow through an application load balancer to several web application services running in containers. This is our core compute and where all the application code runs. Let’s assume that these are disparate microservices processing all types of data, some of which are considered secret. For the most sensitive data, they use KMS to encrypt and then store the ciphertext blobs in their respective database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, applications use a standard logging library to emit to stdout, which gets shipped to CloudWatch and then forwarded to Datadog. That’s the final stop, and that’s where employees, devs, support staff, etc. can view them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I highly recommend going through an exercise like this, because not only does it force you to understand the flows and boundaries of the system, if you spend time at each node and threat model it, you end up finding a bunch of unexpected ways and places that secrets make it into logs. For example&amp;amp;mldr;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Front-end analytics! It turns out that secrets from things like form contents to session replays could end up getting sent to your user analytics platform.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And then what about our application load balancers? These ship their HTTP logs directly to CloudWatch, so we could be logging embedded secrets in URLs, and it’s totally bypassing our application tiers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Last surprise: error monitoring! Let’s just say that some team wired up Sentry instead of DataDog for error monitoring, because of course they did, and now you have another stream of secrets in logs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could go further, and we haven’t even drilled into application architecture, but I think this is a good time to move from discovery to action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Protect at chokepoints&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step we want to take is to protect the chokepoints. And if some flow isn’t going through that chokepoint, like our rogue team that yeeted Sentry into prod, we fix it! We can get rid of Sentry and get that team onto the paved path of our logging pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a very clear chokepoint; a narrow path that most logs eventually flow through. Here’s where most of our lead bullets should go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s that chokepoint splayed out. I also added an upstream node to represent CI/CD, because that’s how code get into our apps. We can then put the bulk of our protective controls here on the critical path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can re-architect the app to use a single logging library and secure-by-default domain primitives. Then we could use those to build out and augment our static analysis, taint-checking, and unit tests. These give us a decent front-line defense for our logging pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Apply defense-in-depth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Every preventative control should have a detective control at the same level and/or one level downstream in the architecture.” -Phil Venables, https://www.philvenables.com/post/defense-in-depth&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third step is about adding depth to that defense, a concept we’re all familiar with. I really like how Phil Venables crystallizes what defense-in-depth means and I think he generally gives great advice. The idea is that our controls are not simply overlapping, but mutually supportive. Something’s always got your back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along this chokepoint we add our downstream components, in depth. Some are preventative, while some are detective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can add additional protections like tokenization and read-once objects. We can add the downstream tools like our custom log formatters, and employ various sensitive data scanners at different points. And then finally, we can educate and equip our team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what defense-in-depth looks like to me, and I think this maximizes chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Plan for response and recovery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Determine the scope&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restrict access&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stop the bleeding / ﬁx the source&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean up all the places, e.g. indexes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restore access&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do a post-mortem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make it ~impossible to happen again&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, of course, if we do miss or if we manage to only detect vs. prevent, we should be prepared for response and recovery. You already know how to respond to incidents like this, so I won’t add much here, other than making sure you’re sticking to a playbook in the right order, pulling levers to restrict and restore access while you’re responding, as well as thinking about all the weird places secrets might persist in logs, like indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s it. This is the culmination of our strategy, our work, and about 30 some minutes of blabber.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a solid foundation and understanding of our data flows, we protected our chokepoints in-depth and kept secrets out of logs. We’ve also introduced a lot of other strong primitives that materially improve our security program. So is that it? Is the job done?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, no, because the data team wired up some ETL jobs that are now spewing secrets into data lake logs, because of course they did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like most things in security, the job often isn’t ever done. But we have the understanding, the tools, and a strategy to fight the next fight. Keeping secrets out of logs is in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key points&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swinburne and CSIRO researchers are investigating ways to produce native metals using materials found on Mars.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Martian settlements will require large amounts of metal that are difficult to ship from Earth.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The team have successfully produced iron using regolith simulant that mimics what is available on the Red Planet.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea of building settlements on Mars is a popular goal of billionaires, space agencies and interplanetary enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But construction demands materials, and we can't ship it all from Earth: it cost US$243 million just to send NASA's one tonne Perseverance Rover to the Red Planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless we're building a settlement for ants, we'll need much, much more stuff. So how do we get it there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CSIRO Postdoctoral Fellow and Swinburne alum Dr Deddy Nababan has been pondering this question for years. His answer lies in the Martian dirt, known as regolith.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Sending metals to Mars from Earth might be feasible, but it's not economical. Can you imagine bringing tonnes of metals to Mars? It's just not practical," Dr Nababan says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Instead, we can use what's available on Mars. It's called in-situ resource utilisation, or ISRU."&lt;lb/&gt; More specifically, Dr Nababan is looking at astrometallurgy — making metals in space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building an off-world foundry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Mars has all the ingredients needed to make native metals. This includes iron-rich oxides in regolith and carbon from its thin atmosphere, which acts as a reducing agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swinburne University of Technology astrometallurgist, Professor Akbar Rhamdhani, is working with Dr Nababan to test this process with regolith simulant - an artificial recreation of the stuff found of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We picked a simulant with very similar properties to that found at Gale Crater on Mars and processed them on Earth with simulated Mars conditions. This gives us a good idea of how the process would perform off-world," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simulant is placed inside a chamber at Mars surface pressure and heated at increasing temperatures. The experiments showed pure iron metal formation around 1000°C, with liquid silicon-iron alloys produced around 1400°C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"At high enough temperatures, all of the metals coalesced into one large droplet. This could then be separated from liquid slag the same way it is on Earth," Professor Rhamdhani says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with Dr Nababan, Prof Rhamdhani is collaborating with CSIRO's Dr Mark Pownceby to further advance the process. They're particularly focused on making metals with zero waste, where the byproducts of the process are used to make useful items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;If you can't ship it, make it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ISRU is a growing area of space science because in rocket launches, every kilogram counts. While the cost of launches is going down, the demands of human exploration are immense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But huge developments are already happening, including the first demonstration of ISRU off-world. The MOXIE experiment on board the Mars Perseverance rover produced breathable oxygen using only the carbon dioxide in the planet's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metal production is the next giant leap. Prof Rhamdhani hopes Mars-made alloys could be used as shells for housing or research facilities, and in machinery for excavation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There are certainly challenges. We need to better understand how these alloys would perform over time, and of course whether this process can be recreated on the real Martian surface," Prof Rhamdhani says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in the meantime, Swinburne and its partners are doubling down. Prof Rhamdhani together with Dr Nababan and Dr Matt Shaw, another CSIRO researcher and Swinburne alum, recently delivered a 4-day bespoke workshop on astrometallurgy in South Korea. The feedback was promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We're starting to see increased interest in this field globally as the world gets serious about Mars exploration," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"To make it happen, we're going to need experts from many fields — mining, engineering, geology, and much more."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Dr Nababan, the benefits go beyond exploration. He hopes their research will also drive more efficient metallurgy here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"By doing this, I wish that I can help the development of space exploration, and at the end it will bring good to human life here on Earth."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Just How Bad Would an AI Bubble Be?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entire U.S. economy is being propped up by the promise of productivity gains that seem very far from materializing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listen to more stories on the Noa app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is any field in which the rise of AI is already said to be rendering humans obsolete—in which the dawn of superintelligence is already upon us—it is coding. This makes the results of a recent study genuinely astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the study, published in July, the think tank Model Evaluation &amp;amp; Threat Research randomly assigned a group of experienced software developers to perform coding tasks with or without AI tools. It was the most rigorous test to date of how AI would perform in the real world. Because coding is one of the skills that existing models have largely mastered, just about everyone involved expected AI to generate huge productivity gains. In a pre-experiment survey of experts, the mean prediction was that AI would speed developers’ work by nearly 40 percent. Afterward, the study participants estimated that AI had made them 20 percent faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when the METR team looked at the employees’ actual work output, they found that the developers had completed tasks 20 percent slower when using AI than when working without it. The researchers were stunned. “No one expected that outcome,” Nate Rush, one of the authors of the study, told me. “We didn’t even really consider a slowdown as a possibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No individual experiment should be treated as the final word. But the METR study is, according to many AI experts, the best we have—and it helps make sense of an otherwise paradoxical moment for AI. On the one hand, the United States is undergoing an extraordinary, AI-fueled economic boom: The stock market is soaring thanks to the frothy valuations of AI-associated tech giants, and the real economy is being propelled by hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. Undergirding all of the investment is the belief that AI will make workers dramatically more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unimaginable levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, evidence is piling up that AI is failing to deliver in the real world. The tech giants pouring the most money into AI are nowhere close to recouping their investments. Research suggests that the companies trying to incorporate AI have seen virtually no impact on their bottom line. And economists looking for evidence of AI-replaced job displacement have mostly come up empty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of that means that AI can’t eventually be every bit as transformative as its biggest boosters claim it will be. But eventually could turn out to be a long time. This raises the possibility that we’re currently experiencing an AI bubble, in which investor excitement has gotten too far ahead of the technology’s near-term productivity benefits. If that bubble bursts, it could put the dot-com crash to shame—and the tech giants and their Silicon Valley backers won’t be the only ones who suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost everyone agrees that coding is the most impressive use case for current AI technology. Before its most recent study, METR was best known for a March analysis showing that the most advanced systems could handle coding tasks that take a typical human developer nearly an hour to finish. So how could AI have made the developers in its experiment less productive?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer has to do with the “capability-reliability gap.” Although AI systems have learned to perform an impressive set of tasks, they struggle to complete those tasks with the consistency and accuracy demanded in real-world settings. The results of the March METR study, for example, were based on a “50 percent success rate,” meaning the AI system could reliably complete the task only half the time—making it essentially useless on its own. This gap makes using AI in a work context challenging. Even the most advanced systems make small mistakes or slightly misunderstand directions, requiring a human to carefully review their work and make changes where needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This appears to be what happened during the newer study. Developers ended up spending a lot of time checking and redoing the code that AI systems had produced—often more time than it would have taken to simply write it themselves. One participant later described the process as the “digital equivalent of shoulder-surfing an overconfident junior developer.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the experiment was conducted, AI coding tools have gotten more reliable. And the study focused on expert developers, whereas the biggest productivity gains could come from enhancing—or replacing—the capabilities of less experienced workers. But the METR study might just as easily be overestimating AI-related productivity benefits. Many knowledge-work tasks are harder to automate than coding, which benefits from huge amounts of training data and clear definitions of success. “Programming is something that AI systems tend to do extremely well,” Tim Fist, the director of Emerging Technology Policy at the Institute for Progress, told me. “So if it turns out they aren’t even making developers more productive, that could really change the picture of how AI might impact economic growth in general.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capability-reliability gap might explain why generative AI has so far failed to deliver tangible results for businesses that use it. When researchers at MIT recently tracked the results of 300 publicly disclosed AI initiatives, they found that 95 percent of projects failed to deliver any boost to profits. A March report from McKinsey &amp;amp; Company found that 71 percent of companies reported using generative AI, and more than 80 percent of them reported that the technology had no “tangible impact” on earnings. In light of these trends, Gartner, a tech-consulting firm, recently declared that AI has entered the “trough of disillusionment” phase of technological development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps AI advancement is experiencing only a temporary blip. According to Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at Stanford University, every new technology experiences a “productivity J-curve”: At first, businesses struggle to deploy it, causing productivity to fall. Eventually, however, they learn to integrate it, and productivity soars. The canonical example is electricity, which became available in the 1880s but didn’t begin to generate big productivity gains for firms until Henry Ford reimagined factory production in the 1910s. Some experts believe that this process will play out much faster for AI. “With AI, we’re in the early, negative part of the J-curve,” Brynjolfsson told me. “But by the second half of the 2020s, it’s really going to take off.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has predicted that by 2027, or “not much longer than that,” AI will be “better than humans at almost everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These forecasts assume that AI will continue to improve as fast as it has over the past few years. This is not a given. Newer models have been marred by delays and cancellations, and those released this year have generally shown fewer big improvements than past models despite being far more expensive to develop. In a March survey, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence asked 475 AI researchers whether current approaches to AI development could produce a system that matches or surpasses human intelligence; more than three-fourths said that it was “unlikely” or “very unlikely.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s latest model, GPT-5, was released early last month after nearly three years of work and billions in spending. (The Atlantic entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI in 2024.) Before the launch, CEO Sam Altman declared that using it would be the equivalent of having “a legitimate Ph.D.-level expert in anything” at your fingertips. In a few areas, including coding, GPT-5 was indeed a major step up. But by most rigorous measures of AI performance, GPT-5 turned out to be, at best, a modest improvement over previous models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dominant view within the industry is that it is only a matter of time before companies find the next way to supercharge AI progress. That could turn out to be true, but it is far from guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generative AI would not be the first tech fad to experience a wave of excessive hype. What makes the current situation distinctive is that AI appears to be propping up something like the entire U.S. economy. More than half of the growth of the S&amp;amp;P 500 since 2023 has come from just seven companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. These firms, collectively known as the Magnificent Seven, are seen as especially well positioned to prosper from the AI revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That prosperity has largely yet to materialize anywhere other than their share prices. (The exception is Nvidia, which provides the crucial inputs—advanced chips—that the rest of the Magnificent Seven are buying.) As The Wall Street Journal reports, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have seen their free cash flow decline by 30 percent over the past two years. By one estimate, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Tesla will by the end of this year have collectively spent $560 billion on AI-related capital expenditures since the beginning of 2024 and have brought in just $35 billion in AI-related revenue. OpenAI and Anthropic are bringing in lots of revenue and are growing fast, but they are still nowhere near profitable. Their valuations—roughly $300 billion and $183 billion, respectively, and rising—are many multiples higher than their current revenues. (OpenAI projects about $13 billion in revenues this year; Anthropic, $2 billion to $4 billion.) Investors are betting heavily on the prospect that all of this spending will soon generate record-breaking profits. If that belief collapses, however, investors might start to sell en masse, causing the market to experience a large and painful correction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the internet revolution of the 1990s, investors poured their money into basically every company with a “.com” in its name, based on the belief that the internet was about to revolutionize business. By 2000, however, it had become clear that companies were burning through cash with little to show for it, and investors responded by dumping the most overpriced tech stocks. From March 2000 to October 2002, the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell by nearly 50 percent. Eventually, the internet did indeed transform the economy and lead to some of the most profitable companies in human history. But that didn’t prevent a whole lot of investors from losing their shirts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dot-com crash was bad, but it did not trigger a crisis. An AI-bubble crash could be different. AI-related investments have already surpassed the level that telecom hit at the peak of the dot-com boom as a share of the economy. In the first half of this year, business spending on AI added more to GDP growth than all consumer spending combined. Many experts believe that a major reason the U.S. economy has been able to weather tariffs and mass deportations without a recession is because all of this AI spending is acting, in the words of one economist, as a “massive private sector stimulus program.” An AI crash could lead broadly to less spending, fewer jobs, and slower growth, potentially dragging the economy into a recession. The economist Noah Smith argues that it could even lead to a financial crisis if the unregulated “private credit” loans funding much of the industry’s expansion all go bust at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we do turn out to be in an AI bubble, the silver lining would be that fears of sudden AI-driven job displacement are overblown. In a recent analysis, the economists Sarah Eckhardt and Nathan Goldschlag used five different measurements of AI exposure to estimate how the new technology might be affecting a range of labor-market indicators and found virtually no effect on any of them. For example, they note that the unemployment rate for the workers least exposed to AI, such as construction workers and fitness trainers, has risen three times faster than the rate for the workers most exposed to it, such as telemarketers and software developers. Most other studies, though not all, have come to similar conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s also a weirder, in-between possibility. Even if AI tools don’t increase productivity, the hype surrounding them could push businesses to keep expanding their use anyway. “I hear the same story over and over again from companies,” Daron Acemoglu, an economist at MIT, told me. “Mid-to-high-level managers are being told by their bosses that they need to use AI for X percent of their job to satisfy the board.” These companies might even lay off workers or slow their hiring because they are convinced—like the software developers from the METR study—that AI has made them more productive, even when it hasn’t. The result would be an increase in unemployment that isn’t offset by actual gains in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As unlikely as this scenario sounds, a version of it happened in the not-so-distant past. In his 2021 book, A World Without Email, the computer scientist Cal Newport points out that beginning in the 1980s, tools such as computers, email, and online calendars allowed knowledge workers to handle their own communications and schedule their own meetings. In turn, many companies decided to lay off their secretaries and typists. In a perverse result, higher-skilled employees started spending so much of their time sending emails, writing up meeting notes, and scheduling meetings that they became far less productive at their actual job, forcing the companies to hire more of them to do the same amount of work. A later study of 20 Fortune 500 companies found that those with computer-driven “staffing imbalances” were spending 15 percent more on salary than they needed to. “Email was one of those technologies that made us feel more productive but actually did the opposite,” Newport told me. “I worry we may be headed down the same path with AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then again, if the alternative is a stock-market crash that precipitates a recession or a financial crisis, that scenario might not be so bad.&lt;/p&gt;
