  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We shouldn't have to cater to the lowest common denominator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We warned a couple of months ago when the Trump administration's "Crypto Brief" was released that there was some language in the brief that advised the government to expand the Patriot Act to account for digital assets. Well, it looks like FinCen and the Treasury have been working on guidelines and a rough outline is shared above courtesy of The Rage, and they are absolutely horrid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that FinCen and the Treasury are preparing to outlaw the use of CoinJoin, atomic swaps, single address use, and transaction broadcast timing delays. All of which are common best use practices that I would recommend any bitcoiner leveraging self-custody practice. This is an all out attack on financial privacy within bitcoin. If enacted, any user who leverages these tools will be flagged as a suspicious, any attempts to send a UTXO that has touched any of these tools will be rejected by regulated services, and could potentially be sent to prison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an absurd affront to common sensibilities and freedom in the digital age. The fact that they want to prevent people from using single addresses for individual UTXOs is patently absurd. Not only is it a massive infringement on privacy, but it makes bitcoin usage less economically efficient and degrades the security of every bitcoiner. Loading up a single address with too many UTXOs degrades the entropy of a public-private key pair and makes it easier to brute force a user's private key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of expanding the Patriot Act, it should be abolished. Instead of trying to eliminate financial privacy for the 99.9% of law abiding citizens in this country, the government should be actively trying to foster an environment in which it can be improved. The proposed solutions will do nothing but put good Americans in harm's way and degrade the security of their savings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We shouldn't have to live in a world where standards cater to the lowest common denominator, in this case criminals, and make things worse off for the overwhelming majority of the population. It's crazy that this even has to be said. The onus is on law enforcement to be so good at their jobs that they are able to prevent crimes from happening before they occur and effectively bring criminals to heel after they commit crimes. It shouldn't be on a neutral protocol and the industry being built on top of it that, when used effectively, provides people with a stable monetary system that respects user privacy and equips them with the tools to receive and spend in a way that provides them with peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why should everyone have to suffer because of a few bad apples? Isn't that letting the terrorist win?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mel Mattison revealed a fascinating shift in Bitcoin's market dynamics that challenges conventional crypto wisdom. He pointed out that Bitcoin futures now exhibit lower volatility than platinum futures - a remarkable transformation for an asset once synonymous with wild price swings. The proliferation of ETFs, options, futures, and other traditional financial instruments has fundamentally altered Bitcoin's behavior, creating what Mel calls "volatility suppression." This institutionalization comes with trade-offs: while reducing dramatic downswings, it also caps explosive upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"Bitcoin is becoming a TradFi security instrument and it's getting TradFi vol." - Mel Mattison&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mel argued that the relationship between volatility and returns means investors must recalibrate expectations. Where 100% annual gains once seemed routine, he now considers 50% returns "massive" for this new era of Bitcoin. This maturation reflects Bitcoin's evolution from speculative experiment to financial infrastructure - less exciting perhaps, but ultimately more sustainable for long-term adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;3D Modeling with Paper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, I've enjoyed the hobby of paper modeling (or papercraft), the art of creating 3D models from cut and glued parts from paper sheets. This hobby is a superset of origami, in that it allows for cutting and gluing, as well as for multiple sheets of paper for a single model. The alleviation of these constraints means that papercraft allows for more complex models that are easier to assemble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over many years, I've built models designed by others as well as designed my own. In this post, I want to share everything I've learned along the way, covering the entire process from design to assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love this hobby for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is extremely accessible. There is no fancy hardware or software involved. As we'll see, the core tools are paper, scissors, and glue; everything else is an addon to make the experience better. All software tools can be free. Accidentally messed up during assembly and need a replacement part? Just print out another page. The entire creation of a model can be done in the ballpark of a few cents.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is equally technical and creative. As we'll see, many of the problems faced in papercraft require an engineering-like approach and a willingness to experiment and iterate on designs. While it may appear outwardly like a craft project, the end-to-end process involves constraints and optimizing within them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There's no limits on what you can make. What you decide to build is limited by your patience and imagination. Theoretically, nearly any object can be represented as a paper model.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's dive in. My most recent model is a papercraft plane inspired by the SR-71 Blackbird, a reconnaissance plane that to this day holds many records for being one of the fastest aircrafts ever. It's now one of most iconic planes ever designed and an engineering masterpiece. The program was ultimately retired in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're going to walk through the full model design and assembly process, while referencing specific examples I encountered during creating this SR-71.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Constraints#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's set some constraints for how we're allowed to model our creation. These are self-imposed limitations that fit my preferred-style for model design:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All parts in the assembled model must be made of paper.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each part must be a single, solid color. The parts must not use any printed textures or designs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The model must be represented as a simple polyhedron. There may be no curvatures, holes, two-dimensional surfaces, or surface-to-surface contact. If the figure we're trying to capture has any of these features, we must find a way to approximate it using only flat faces. The object must be manifold (an edge is only shared by 2 faces).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why constraints?#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It may feel weird to impose constraints on an art. However, I find that these constraints encourage a better designed model that can be assembled easily and predictably, including by others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using features like curvatures, printing with textures, etc. are shortcuts. For example, printing textures helps fill in details that aren't captured inherently by the model; curvatures and 2d surfaces are flimsy and introduce variances in how a model can be assembled. Simply polyhedral designs with single color parts ensure that the 3D form itself captures the object being depicted, and can be assembled in a structurally sound, predictable way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Goals#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to constraints, we also have some goals that we're optimzing for. These goals will be considered in each step of our design process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ease of assembly: By far the most important goal, our model should be easy to put together. Given the nature of paper and glue, a model that is difficult to assemble will almost certainly look bad. A model can have a well-designed topology, but still be difficult to assemble based on the parts design we put together.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aesthetic appeal: This is an art, after all. The model we design should be aesthetically pleasing and resemble the object of interest.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimal consumption of resources: We should aim to minimize waste and use our materials efficiently.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As in engineering, we have to consider trade-offs between these goals, and optimize for these goals within our constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Steps#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process of designing a paper model is iterative. Each iteration consists of the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mesh modeling - using software to create a 3D polyhedron mesh of our desired form&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mesh unfolding - unfolding the mesh into a 2D layout of parts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assembly - putting the parts together to create the final model&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remainder of this article will be walking through each step in detail. The discussion of each step will be centered around the goals and constraints declared from above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mesh Modeling#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related goals: Ease of assembly, aesthetic appeal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this phase, we design the mesh for our model. We aim to capture the essence of an object in a way that can feasibly be built with paper. Depending on how you approach this, this can easily be the most complicated step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do I mean by "feasibly built with paper"? Our mesh is a collection of polygons that represent a 3D object. The closeness of that representation is largely determined by how many polygons we use. We could use many really small polygons to closely match the subtle curves of our plane, but this would be hard to assemble in reality. Alternatively, we could simplifiy our representation down to a triangular pyramid. This would be trivially easy to assemble, but it wouldn't look a lot like our plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can now see that our goals of ease of assembly and aesthetic appeal are at odds. Imagine that we have a continuum, where on the left we have a triangular pyramid (the simplest possible polyhedron) and on the right we have a mesh of the SR-71 with an arbitrarily high number (millions) of polygons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally, an "easy" to assemble model will have somewhere around a few hundred polygons. Thus, our ideal model exists somewhere on the far left of this spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge here is what I call "allocation of resolution" - we have a finite number of polygons to distribute across the features of our object. Certain features will naturally require more polygons to be accurately captured than others. For example, curved features require more polygons than flat features - in this model, the cylindrical engines will require more detail, than say, the flat wings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the number of polygons and their concentrations, the arrangement of the polygons themselves matters - this is the topology of the mesh. Most discourse on 3D mesh topology is related to shading and animation. For our purposes, we're considered with ease of assembly. Certain topologies are easier to assemble and more structurally sound. Generally, here's some positive topological qualities for papercraft:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symmetries: a good mesh design is symetrical when possible. Symmetrical shapes are intuitive and easier to reason about when assembling.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No narrow shapes: really narrow shapes are hard to cut out, hard to fold, and hard to glue. Avoid them at all costs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use quads: quad faces have an aesthetic appeal to them.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If all of this is sounding hard, we've got some options, in increasing order of difficulty:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Easy: Use an existing mesh#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easiest way past this step is to find an existing mesh. There's a whole genre of 3D modeling called "low-poly" that you can find with a quick search on Thingiverse or Printables. These are usually designed for video games or 3D printing, but can be taken up for papercraft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Medium: Converting an existing mesh#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you can find a high-resolution mesh of your desired object, but not a low-poly one. In this case, there are tools available to reduce the polygon count while preserving the overall shape. This is called "mesh simplification" or "mesh decimation."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Instructable goes over the process of doing this with Meshlab, but there's many other software alternatives out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pitfall of this approach is that automatic mesh decimation typically results in some nasty topologies, and there's not a lot you can do to control the output. To get around this, we could add an additional refinement step where we take the raw decimated mesh output and "clean it up" using a mesh editor software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an example, let's try this with a SR-71 mesh on Thingiverse. The original mesh has more than 1.2 million faces, and we're going to try decimating down to ~1,000. Here's what we get from Meshlab:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, the output is not usable - it's wildly asymetric and is full of self-intersections. Refining this topology would take just as long (if not longer) as creating a model from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hard: Creating your own mesh#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most difficult option is to create your own mesh from scratch. This option gives you full control over the design, and is what I chose for the SR-71 model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My software of choice for this is Blender. Blender has a steep learning curve, but the type of mesh design we're doing for this project doesn't begin to scratch the surface of its full capabilities. I highly recommend this low-poly tutorial if you've never used Blender before and need somewhere to start. Two things I found very handy were the mirror modifier to enforce symmetry, and the 3D Print Toolbox to auto-cleanup the mesh and check for manifoldness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This process is very tedious. My advice here is: simplify your mesh to the point where you feel uncomfortable. Recall that we're largely optimizing for ease of assembly. When modeling, it's very tempting to capture finer details, but fine details have costs (small parts, hard to glue regions, etc.) that are not worth it during the assembly phase. Scrutinize every feature, and zoom out once in a while. When you zoom out, your omissions won't feel as weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After many days, here's the initial mesh I created. It contains 732 triangles. Note the symmetry along the y-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mesh Unfolding#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related goals: Ease of assembly, minimal consumption of resources&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we have a mesh, we have to convert it into a 2D template of parts that can be printed and assembled. This process is called unfolding. Each of the faces of our mesh are grouped into parts, and the arrangement of our parts is a layout, or template.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do this, we're going to turn to software again. The most popular unfolding tool (and my favorite) is Pepakura Designer. Pepakura is not free (at the time of this writing, it's a one time $70 purchase) and it only runs on Windows. There's also Unfolder for Mac, which is $30. If you can't use either of these, Blender can save the day again with its free Paper Model plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe that the unfolding step is one that does not get as much attention as it deserves. There is a noticable difference between a good template and a bad one. A good template has parts that make intuitive sense, with logical groupings and clear flow. The faces themselves are grouped into parts that are easy to cut out and handle. All of this equates to a better building experience, which means a better looking model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of unfolding is also deciding the scale of your model. You can make your model as big or small as you want, but again, ease of assembly should be top of mind when deciding. A model that's too small will end up with parts that are hard to cut out and fold. Bigger models are easier to assemble, but you're limited to the point where the faces of your model must fit on a page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up making this model 25 inches long. With the original SR-71 being about 107 feet long, this puts our model at around a 1:50 ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Creating many parts#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start off with the creation of parts. In most unfolding software, the software will auto-unfold for you, and from there you can regroup faces into whatever parts you want. Here's Pepakura's auto unfold:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The parts it generated are pretty complicated, so we have some work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have a mesh with faces, you can have anywhere from 1 (all the faces in a single part) to total parts (each part is a single face). We want our model to be easy to assemble, and neither of these extremes are easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to fix the number of parts and going from there, I recommend creating parts that are logical. Identify features that can be captured in a single part, and go from there. For example, in the SR-71, each engine intake spike makes sense as a single part. So does the nose cone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your mesh has an axis of symmetry, then your parts have symmetrical pairings as well. The same feature on either side of the axis should be represented with a mirrored part. In the SR-71, the entire plane is symmetrical on the vertical axis, so all parts across this axis are mirrored. This is good because once someone builds one side, they can more easily reason about the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up dividing this model into 42 parts. These parts were carefully divided in such a way that I felt would make them easier to assemble. If you look at any part in particular, chances are it'll have a symmetric counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They're arranged pretty haphazardly right now, but we'll cleanup this up in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Arranging the parts#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, most software will automatically arrange the parts for you as part of unfolding. Here's the 14 page arrangement Pepakura decided for the parts I created:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I highlighted all the parts on the first two pages so you can see where the are on the finished model. Notice that they're scattered throughout different sections. That's why I typically don't like auto-arrangement - they're designed to minimize paper usage, but they often result in a less intuitive assembly process. You can't look at any particular page and loosely know where its parts will go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good part layout reads like a story. Parts are arranged in a logical order, with related parts grouped together. I like to arrange mine left to right, top to bottom on a page. Here's my layout, with the first two pages highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the parts that are near each other in the layout are also near each other in the final assembly. In this case, I even was able to reduce the page count down to 12 from the starting 14.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Flap structure#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flaps, or tabs, are the appendages on each part that allow for gluing parts together. Each flap has a singular counterpart edge that it's glued to - this is known as an edge/flap pair. Most software will auto-assign a shared number between an edge and its flap to make identify pairs easy during the assembly process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For an edge/flap pair, most unfolding software will allow us to swap the flap across parts. Doing this strategically is critical for creating an easy to assemble model, and also has implications for the structural integrity of the final build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, consider the two example parts shown above. These two parts that meet at two shared edges, so these parts have two edge/flap pairs between them. We could arrange the flaps so that one part has both of them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could also interlace the flaps, so each part has one flap on each side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interlacing flaps between parts can create a more stable structure, since there's only one way for the parts to meet. If two flaps are on the same side, they can over-extend when glued to the edge. That being said, same-side flaps can be easier to work with, especially when reaching the closing stages of a model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, I like to using interlaced flaps wherever possible to create an overall stronger model, and use same-side flaps selectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we have an arrangement we like, we can export our layout as a PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Assembly#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our layout PDF ready, we can now print it and move on to assembly. We'll finally get to see our design come to life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Materials and Tools#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our materials, we'll need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;65lb (176 ) cardstock: This is the ideal paper weight for creating sturdy models, while still being thin/flexible enough to pass through a normal printer and be easy to fold.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adhesive. My recommended adhesive is tacky glue: it's strong, dries clear, but is forgiving enough to allow for repositioning during assembly. Specifically, I use Aleene's Original Tacky Glue. I've also had past success with a glue stick.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll also need some tools, which I've listed these in order of importance. The ones with asterisks are essential. Everything else is a nice-to-have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Printer*: You'll need access to a printer to print the template on the cardstock. Laser jet printers are great because the prints don't smudge.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cutting tools*: You'll need a pair of scissors or a craft knife to cut out the parts. Use sharp tools for clean cuts - it makes a difference.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ruler*: Cutting/scoring perfectly straight lines is a must. Steel rulers are great for their consistent edge, and they don't catch against your tools. That being said, I used a clear plastic ruler for this model. Being able to see through the ruler helps with alignment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scoring tool*: This will help you prepare a part for folding. You can use a bone folder or scoring wheel. I use an embossing tool I found at a dollar store, but before that, I used a ballpoint pen than ran out of ink. Anything with a precise (but not too sharp) tip will do.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Toothpicks: I use toothpicks to spread blobs of glue into thin layers and get into tight spaces.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assembly surface: A cutting mat or piece of cardboard will protect your work surface and give you a stable surface to cut/score your parts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tweezers: Tweezers are helpful for handling small parts and getting into tight spaces, especially while holding parts together as glue dries.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to get fancy, you can also purchase an automatic cutting machine, like a Cricut or Silhouette. These machines can precisely cut/score your parts from cardstock. Getting the template into their software takes some extra effort, but it results in the best quality parts. I did not use a machine for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To match the real SR-71, I printed my template on black cardstock. Darker cardstocks are harder to work with because of the low contrast between the ink and the paper itself. If you're new to the hobby, I would recommend starting with a lighter color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Assembly phases#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The assembly of a model has 4 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cutting: Cutting the parts out from the paper with your cutting tool of choice. Scissors are quicker, but the combination of ruler and craft knife results in cleaner cuts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scoring: Running a scoring tool over fold lines to get cleaner folds. This may be tempting to skip, but I cannot emphasize the importance of this step enough. Scoring is especially important when dealing with thicker paper.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Folding: Folding the parts in prep for gluing. There's only two types of folds: mountain folds and valley folds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gluing: Gluing the parts together.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How you decide to batch these steps is up to you. For example, you could cut all the parts out at once, then score all of them, etc. This approach is effective because you can develop a rhythm by doing each phase only once, so you're not constantly switching between tools; the downside is that you only get to start assembly after a pretty lengthy process. Alternatively, you can do it per part: cut one part out, score it, fold it, and secure it to the assembly. Here, the pros and cons are flipped: you get to see the model come together quicker, but there's a lot of context switching between phases. I've tried both of these approaches, and find that the latter results in a non-negligible increase in the assembly time of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To strike a balance, the approach I took for this model was performing the phases at the granularity of sections (engines, wings, fuselage, etc.) of the model. This approach has the added final step of assembling all the standalone sections together into the final model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's some pictures I took during the assembly process. In total, assembly took 6-8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tips#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use little glue: When gluing parts together, apply as little glue as possible. Using too much glue will result in spillover when the flaps/edges are put together, and this spillover is hard to wipe away from a porous surface like paper. Too much glue can even result in subtle paper warping. In the recommended tools, I suggested a toothpick. I apply a small bead of glue to a flap and use the toothpick to spread it into a thin film. This prevents any spillage and keeps the model clean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start in complex areas: As you progress further in gluing parts together, the degrees of freedom of your model will reduce. This is why I recommend starting with more complicated areas of your model where you'll need those degrees of freedom. In this model, this meant starting with precise features, like the engine inlet spikes or the vertical stabilizers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finish in hidden areas: This goes hand in hand with the tip above. As you reach to the end of your model, gluing the final parts together can be very hard, which means the final edges may come out a bit sloppy. Why does this happen? Any minor imperfections we made throughout the assembly process result in stresses in our model that will be felt at the end. Gluing the last part may be challenging because it'll feel misaligned, and it has the added challenge of attempting to close a 3D object from the outside. That's why I always recommend choosing an assembly order that results in the last parts being glued in an area that is out of sight. For the SR-71, that happens to be the underside of the fuselage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Final Model#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the final model, displayed on a stand (also made from paper):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Iteration#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No matter how much you scrutinize the modeling and layout phases, you will inevitably find areas for improvement as you assemble. In the case of the SR-71, I spotted a few minor assymetries in part tabs, and more importantly, an opportunity to reduce face count by simplifying the topology of the bottom of the plane and the nose cone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I took my mesh back into Blender, and was able to get the triangle count down to 636, which is almost a full 100 faces fewer than the original mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below, you can see the old mesh (left) next to the new mesh (right). It's hard to tell the difference, yet the new one has almost 15% fewer faces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A faster way to iterate is to render the model rather than physically building it. This allows you to quickly identify and fix visual issues without going through the hours of assembly. Here's some renders (in Blender) of the final iteration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, the full cycle of designing the mesh, creating the parts layout, assembly, and subsequent refinement iterations occurred over the course of a few months. The process is long, but the results are well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're interested in making this model yourself, you can download the PDFs for the first iteration of the model below. I've included a template for the stand as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Many Hard Leetcode Problems are Easy Constraint Problems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use the right tool for the job.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my first interview out of college I was asked the change counter problem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given number. IE for USA coinage and 37 cents, the minimum number is four (quarter, dime, 2 pennies).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I implemented the simple greedy algorithm and immediately fell into the trap of the question: the greedy algorithm only works for "well-behaved" denominations. If the coin values were &lt;code&gt;[10, 9, 1]&lt;/code&gt;, then making 37 cents would take 10 coins in the greedy algorithm but only 4 coins optimally (&lt;code&gt;10+9+9+9&lt;/code&gt;). The "smart" answer is to use a dynamic programming algorithm, which I didn't know how to do. So I failed the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you only need dynamic programming if you're writing your own algorithm. It's really easy if you throw it into a constraint solver like MiniZinc and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int: total;
array[int] of int: values = [10, 9, 1];
array[index_set(values)] of var 0..: coins;

constraint sum (c in index_set(coins)) (coins[c] * values[c]) == total;
solve minimize sum(coins);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try this online here. It'll give you a prompt to put in &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; and then give you successively-better solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;coins = [0, 0, 37];
----------
coins = [0, 1, 28];
----------
coins = [0, 2, 19];
----------
coins = [0, 3, 10];
----------
coins = [0, 4, 1];
----------
coins = [1, 3, 0];
----------
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of similar interview questions are this kind of mathematical optimization problem, where we have to find the maximum or minimum of a function corresponding to constraints. They're hard in programming languages because programming languages are too low-level. They are also exactly the problems that constraint solvers were designed to solve. Hard leetcode problems are easy constraint problems.1 Here I'm using MiniZinc, but you could just as easily use Z3 or OR-Tools or whatever your favorite generalized solver is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More examples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a question in a different interview (which I thankfully passed):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given a list of stock prices through the day, find maximum profit you can get by buying one stock and selling one stock later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's easy to do in O(n^2) time, or if you are clever, you can do it in O(n). Or you could be not clever at all and just write it as a constraint problem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
var int: buy;
var int: sell;
var int: profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy];

constraint sell &amp;gt; buy;
constraint profit &amp;gt; 0;
solve maximize profit;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reminder, link to trying it online here. While working at that job, one interview question we tested out was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given a list, determine if three numbers in that list can be added or subtracted to give 0?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a satisfaction problem, not a constraint problem: we don't need the "best answer", any answer will do. We eventually decided against it for being too tricky for the engineers we were targeting. But it's not tricky in a solver;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;include "globals.mzn";
array[int] of int: numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array[index_set(numbers)] of var {0, -1, 1}: choices;

constraint sum(n in index_set(numbers)) (numbers[n] * choices[n]) = 0;
constraint count(choices, -1) + count(choices, 1) = 3;
solve satisfy;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, one last one, a problem I saw last year at Chipy AlgoSIG. Basically they pick some leetcode problems and we all do them. I failed to solve this one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "proper" solution is a tricky thing involving tracking lots of bookkeeping states, which you can completely bypass by expressing it as constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;array[int] of int: numbers = [2,1,5,6,2,3];

var 1..length(numbers): x; 
var 1..length(numbers): dx;
var 1..: y;

constraint x + dx &amp;lt;= length(numbers);
constraint forall (i in x..(x+dx)) (y &amp;lt;= numbers[i]);

var int: area = (dx+1)*y;
solve maximize area;

output ["(\(x)-&amp;gt;\(x+dx))*\(y) = \(area)"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's even a way to automatically visualize the solution (using &lt;code&gt;vis_geost_2d&lt;/code&gt;), but I didn't feel like figuring it out in time for the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is this better?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now if I actually brought these questions to an interview the interviewee could ruin my day by asking "what's the runtime complexity?" Constraint solvers runtimes are unpredictable and almost always than an ideal bespoke algorithm because they are more expressive, in what I refer to as the capability/tractability tradeoff. But even so, they'll do way better than a bad bespoke algorithm, and I'm not experienced enough in handwriting algorithms to consistently beat a solver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real advantage of solvers, though, is how well they handle new constraints. Take the stock picking problem above. I can write an O(n²) algorithm in a few minutes and the O(n) algorithm if you give me some time to think. Now change the problem to&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maximize the profit by buying and selling up to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;max_sales&lt;/code&gt;stocks, but you can only buy or sell one stock at a given time and you can only hold up to&lt;code&gt;max_hold&lt;/code&gt;stocks at a time?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a way harder problem to write even an inefficient algorithm for! While the constraint problem is only a tiny bit more complicated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;include "globals.mzn";
int: max_sales = 3;
int: max_hold = 2;
array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array [1..max_sales] of var int: buy;
array [1..max_sales] of var int: sell;
array [index_set(prices)] of var 0..max_hold: stocks_held;
var int: profit = sum(s in 1..max_sales) (prices[sell[s]] - prices[buy[s]]);

constraint forall (s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] &amp;gt; buy[s]);
constraint profit &amp;gt; 0;

constraint forall(i in index_set(prices)) (stocks_held[i] = (count(s in 1..max_sales) (buy[s] &amp;lt;= i) - count(s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] &amp;lt;= i)));
constraint alldifferent(buy ++ sell);
solve maximize profit;

output ["buy at \(buy)\n", "sell at \(sell)\n", "for \(profit)"];
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most constraint solving examples online are puzzles, like Sudoku or "SEND + MORE = MONEY". Solving leetcode problems would be a more interesting demonstration. And you get more interesting opportunities to teach optimizations, like symmetry breaking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re announcing the OpenAI Grove, a new program for technical talent at the very start of their company-building journey. The Grove is not a startup accelerator or traditional program: it offers pre-idea individuals deeply curious about building in AI a dense talent network, co-building with OpenAI researchers, and resources designed to accelerate your journey. As participants explore early concepts, they will receive counsel from the OpenAI team and community with peers in OpenAI Grove. &lt;lb/&gt;This program is the starting point of a long-term network. It will begin with five weeks of content and programming hosted in the OpenAI San Francisco HQ, including in-person workshops, weekly office hours, and mentoring from OpenAI technical leaders. In addition to technical support and community, participants will also have the opportunity to get hands-on with new OpenAI tools and models prior to general availability. Following the program, participants will be able to explore raising capital or pursue another avenue, internally or externally to OpenAI. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first Grove cohort will consist of approximately fifteen participants. We recommend individuals from all backgrounds, disciplines, and experience levels apply. To apply, please submit the form below by September 24th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications are due by September 24th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;VaultGemma: The world's most capable differentially private LLM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;September 12, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amer Sinha, Software Engineer, and Ryan McKenna, Research Scientist, Google Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We introduce VaultGemma, the most capable model trained from scratch with differential privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, building it with privacy at its core is a critical frontier for the field. Differential privacy (DP) offers a mathematically robust solution by adding calibrated noise to prevent memorization. However, applying DP to LLMs introduces trade-offs. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial. Applying DP noise alters traditional scaling laws — rules describing performance dynamics — by reducing training stability (the model's ability to learn consistently without experiencing catastrophic events like loss spikes or divergence) and significantly increasing batch size (a collection of input prompts sent to the model simultaneously for processing) and computation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our new research, “Scaling Laws for Differentially Private Language Models”, conducted in partnership with Google DeepMind, establishes laws that accurately model these intricacies, providing a complete picture of the compute-privacy-utility trade-offs. Guided by this research, we’re excited to introduce VaultGemma, the largest (1B-parameters), open model trained from scratch with differential privacy. We are releasing the weights on Hugging Face and Kaggle, alongside a technical report, to advance the development of the next generation of private AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Understanding the scaling laws&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a carefully thought-out experimental methodology, we aimed to quantify the benefit of increasing model sizes, batch sizes, and iterations in the context of DP training. Our work required making some simplifying assumptions to overcome the exponential number of combinations one might consider trying. We assumed that how well the model learns depends mostly on the "noise-batch ratio” which compares the amount of random noise we add for privacy to the size of the data groups (batches) we use for training. This assumption works because the privacy noise we add is much greater than any natural randomness that comes from sampling the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To establish a DP scaling law, we conducted a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate performance across a variety of model sizes and noise-batch ratios. The resulting empirical data, together with known deterministic relationships between other variables, allows us to answer a variety of interesting scaling-laws–style queries, such as, “For a given compute budget, privacy budget, and data budget, what is the optimal training configuration to achieve the lowest possible training loss?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key findings: A powerful synergy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before diving into the full scaling laws, it’s useful to understand the dynamics and synergies between the compute budget, privacy budget, and data budget from a privacy accounting perspective — i.e., understand how these factors influence the noise-batch ratio for a fixed model size and number of iterations. This analysis is significantly cheaper to do as it does not require any model training, yet it yields a number of useful insights. For instance, increasing the privacy budget in isolation leads to diminishing returns, unless coupled with a corresponding increase in either the compute budget (FLOPs) or data budget (tokens).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explore this synergy further, the visualization below shows how the optimal training configuration changes based on different constraints. As the privacy and compute budgets change, notice how the recommendation shifts between investing in a larger model versus training with larger batch sizes or more iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This data provides a wealth of useful insights for practitioners. While all the insights are reported in the paper, a key finding is that one should train a much smaller model with a much larger batch size than would be used without DP. This general insight should be unsurprising to a DP expert given the importance of large batch sizes. While this general insight holds across many settings, the optimal training configurations do change with the privacy and data budgets. Understanding the exact trade-off is crucial to ensure that both the compute and privacy budgets are used judiciously in real training scenarios. The above visualizations also reveal that there is often wiggle room in the training configurations — i.e., a range of model sizes might provide very similar utility if paired with the correct number of iterations and/or batch size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Applying the scaling laws to build VaultGemma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Gemma models are designed with responsibility and safety at their core. This makes them a natural foundation for developing a production-quality, DP-trained model like VaultGemma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Algorithmic advancements: Training at scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scaling laws we derived above represent an important first step towards training a useful Gemma model with DP. We used the scaling laws to determine both how much compute we needed to train a compute-optimal 1B parameter Gemma 2-based model with DP, and how to allocate that compute among batch size, iterations, and sequence length to achieve the best utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One prominent gap between the research underlying the scaling laws and the actual training of VaultGemma was our handling of Poisson sampling, which is a central component of DP-SGD. We initially used a straightforward method of loading data in uniform batches but then switched to Poisson sampling to get the best privacy guarantees with the least amount of noise. This method posed two main challenges: it created batches of different sizes, and it required a specific, randomized order for processing the data. We solved this by using our recent work on Scalable DP-SGD, which allows us to process data in fixed-size batches — either by adding extra padding or trimming them — while still maintaining strong privacy protections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Armed with our new scaling laws and advanced training algorithms, we built VaultGemma, to date the largest (1B-parameters) open model fully pre-trained with differential privacy with an approach that can yield high-utility models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From training VaultGemma, we found our scaling laws to be highly accurate. The final training loss of VaultGemma was remarkably close to what our equations predicted, validating our research and providing the community with a reliable roadmap for future private model development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also compare downstream performance of our model against its non-private counterpart across a range of standard academic benchmarks (i.e., HellaSwag, BoolQ, PIQA, SocialIQA, TriviaQA, ARC-C, ARC-E ). To put this performance in perspective and quantify the current resource investment required for privacy, we also include a comparison to an older similar-sized GPT-2 model, which performs similarly on these benchmarks. This comparison illustrates that today’s private training methods produce models with utility comparable to that of non-private models from roughly 5 years ago, highlighting the important gap our work will help the community systematically close.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the model comes with strong theoretical and empirical privacy protections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Formal privacy guarantee&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, both the privacy parameters (ε, δ) and the privacy unit are important considerations when doing DP training, as these together determine what the trained model can learn. VaultGemma was trained with a sequence-level DP guarantee of (ε ≤ 2.0, δ ≤ 1.1e-10), where a sequence consists of 1024 consecutive tokens extracted from heterogeneous data sources. Specifically, we used the same training mixture that was used to train the Gemma 2 model, consisting of a number of documents of varying lengths. During pre-processing, long documents are split up and tokenized into multiple sequences, and shorter documents are packed together into a single sequence. While the sequence-level privacy unit was a natural choice for our training mixture, in situations where there is a clear mapping between data and users, user-level differential privacy would be a better choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does this mean in practice? Informally speaking, because we provide protection at the sequence level, if information relating to any (potentially private) fact or inference occurs in a single sequence, then VaultGemma essentially does not know that fact: the response to any query will be statistically similar to the result from a model that never trained on the sequence in question. However, if many training sequences contain information relevant to a particular fact, then in general VaultGemma will be able to provide that information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Empirical memorization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sequence-level DP provably bounds the influence of any single training sequence (example) on the final model. We prompted the model with a 50-token prefix from a training document to see if it would generate the corresponding 50-token suffix. VaultGemma 1B shows no detectable memorization of its training data and successfully demonstrates the efficacy of DP training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VaultGemma represents a significant step forward in the journey toward building AI that is both powerful and private by design. By developing and applying a new, robust understanding of the scaling laws for DP, we have successfully trained and released the largest open, DP-trained language model to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While a utility gap still exists between DP-trained and non-DP–trained models, we believe this gap can be systematically narrowed with more research on mechanism design for DP training. We hope that VaultGemma and our accompanying research will empower the community to build the next generation of safe, responsible, and private AI for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Machine Learning&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 9 Sep 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:K2-Think: A Parameter-Efficient Reasoning System&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:K2-Think is a reasoning system that achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 32B parameter model, matching or surpassing much larger models like GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek v3.1. Built on the Qwen2.5 base model, our system shows that smaller models can compete at the highest levels by combining advanced post-training and test-time computation techniques. The approach is based on six key technical pillars: Long Chain-of-thought Supervised Finetuning, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), Agentic planning prior to reasoning, Test-time Scaling, Speculative Decoding, and Inference-optimized Hardware, all using publicly available open-source datasets. K2-Think excels in mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art scores on public benchmarks for open-source models, while also performing strongly in other areas such as Code and Science. Our results confirm that a more parameter-efficient model like K2-Think 32B can compete with state-of-the-art systems through an integrated post-training recipe that includes long chain-of-thought training and strategic inference-time enhancements, making open-source reasoning systems more accessible and affordable. K2-Think is freely available at this http URL, offering best-in-class inference speeds of over 2,000 tokens per second per request via the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;humanely dealing with humungus crawlers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I host a bunch of hobby code on my server. I would think it’s really only interesting to me, but it turns out every day, thousands of people from all over the world are digging through my code, reviewing years old changesets. On the one hand, wow, thanks, this is very flattering. On the other hand, what the heck is wrong with you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been building up for a while, and I’ve been intermittently developing and deploying countermeasures. It’s been a lot like solving a sliding block puzzle. Lots of small moves and changes, and eventually it starts coming together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My primary principle is that I’d rather not annoy real humans more than strictly intended. If there’s a challenge, it shouldn’t be too difficult, but ideally, we want to minimize the number of challenges presented. You should never suspect that I suspected you of being an enemy agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First measure is we only challenge on the deep URLs. So, for instance, I can link to the anticrawl repo no problem, or even the source for anticrawl.go, and that’ll be served immediately. All the pages any casual browser would visit make up less than 1% of the possible URLs that exist, but probably contain 99% of the interesting content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, these pages get cached by the reverse proxy first, so anticrawl doesn’t even evaluate them. We’ve already done the work to render the page, and we’re trying to shed load, so why would I want to increase load by generating challenges and verifying responses? It annoys me when I click a seemingly popular blog post and immediately get challenged, when I’m 99.9% certain that somebody else clicked it two seconds before me. Why isn’t it in cache? We must have different objectives in what we’re trying to accomplish. Or who we’re trying to irritate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step is that anybody loading &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; gets marked friendly. Big Basilisk doesn’t care about my artisanal styles, but most everybody else loves them. So if you start at a normal page, and then start clicking deeper, that’s fine, still no challenge. (Sorry lynx browsers, but don’t worry, it’s not game over for you yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then let’s say somebody directly links to a changeset like /r/vertigo/v/b5ea481ff167. The first visitor will probably hit a challenge, but then we record that URL as in use. The bots are shotgun crawling all over the place, but if a single link is visited more than once, I’ll assume it’s human traffic, and bypass the challenge. No promises, but clicking that link will mostly likely just return content, no challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The very first version of anticrawl relied on a weak POW challenge (find a SHA hash with first byte 42), just to get something launched, but this does seem counter intuitive. Why are we making humans solve a challenge optimized for machines? Instead I have switched to a much more diabolical challenge. You are asked how many Rs in strawberry. Or maybe something else. To be changed as necessary. But really, the key observation is that any challenge, anything at all, easily sheds like 99.99% of the crawling load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, because the challenge does not include its own javascript solver, even a smart crawler isn’t going to solve it automatically. If you include the solution on the challenge page, at least some bots are going to use it. All anticrawl challenges now require some degree of contemplation, not just blind interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took a few iterations because the actual deployment involves a few pieces. I had to reduce the &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; cache time, so that visitors would periodically refresh it (and thus their humanity). And then exclude it from the caching proxy, so that the request would be properly observed. Basically, a few minutes tinkering now and then while I wait for my latte to arrive, and now I think I’ve gotten things to the point where it’s unlikely to burden anybody except malignant crawlers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have focused my bot detection efforts on humungus because the ratio of crawler to legit traffic was out of control. But now that I know what to look for, I see the same patterns scraping everywhere else. Seems really unlikely a worldwide colelctive of Opera users is suddenly interested in my old honks. I’m starting to deploy similar countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;appendix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some log samples. There’s always somebody to insist these could be real humans, and I have somehow misjudged them. Make your own decision.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Take a look at this guy. Apparently a pro starcraft player has taken up speed browsing as a side hustle, middle clicking ten times per second. These links aren’t even on the same page, so he’s switching tabs between clicks, too. Amazing. But he doesn’t solve a single challenge. I thought gamers liked puzzles? Maybe that’s why this totally real human quit gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

But that doesn’t account for TLS, etc. 10 handshakes/s requires a bit more juice than GET hello. I’ve worked to keep response times in the low millisecond range, just seems like good sense, but I think people should be allowed to program in slower languages and frameworks. You shouldn’t need a fairly substantial EPYC server like I have, either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there’s always stuff happening in the background. Mastodon hits me once a second every time anybody deletes something. Lemmy hits me twice a second every time somebody likes anything. There’s a bunch of nitwits with misconfigured RSS readers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 4x overhead in one area doesn’t matter, but a 1/4 as powerful CPU, with 1/4 as many cores, and 1/4 as fast language, all of which are entirely realistic, and pretty soon we’re running close to the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How FOSS Projects Handle Legal Takedown Requests&lt;/head&gt;Posted on Sep 10, 2025 by F-Droid&lt;p&gt;When a legal takedown request arrives, whether itâs about copyright, censorship, privacy, or something more vague, how a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project responds can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handled well, a takedown request can be a manageable administrative step. Handled poorly, it can cause panic, disrupt infrastructure, or even put contributors at legal risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our legal resilience research, we spoke with a range of legal experts, software freedom advocates, and maintainers of mature FOSS infrastructure to understand how others manage these moments. In this article, we share what we learned, and how F-Droid is incorporating these lessons into its own approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Pattern Emerges&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite differences in jurisdiction, size, and mission, a few common themes from our research emerged when we asked how other projects handle takedown requests:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Donât Be a Soft Target&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal threats often follow the path of least resistance. FOSS projects that publish a formal takedown policy, require legal submissions through specific channels, and insist on a valid legal basis are much less likely to receive, or comply with, vague or harassing demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One FOSS organization, for example, requires all legal correspondence to be submitted by postal mail in the national language and citing local law. Most complaints evaporate once asked to comply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Creating a transparent and documented process&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several digital rights organizations advised setting up structured response steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Require submissions to a dedicated legal@ or abuse@ email.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Insist on full documentation: legal basis, jurisdiction, evidence of the infringement and identity of the complainant.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Review for sufficiency, proportionality, and standing before acting.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates proper documentation to process valid claims, while protecting projects from illegitimate or unfounded requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Use Jurisdiction Strategically&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects based in civil law jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, are often better positioned to deflect legal demands from foreign entities. Several organizations emphasized that complying with vague or extrajudicial requests, especially those originating outside your jurisdiction, can increase risk unnecessarily. Instead, they recommended requiring a valid legal basis grounded in the projectâs home country. Formal legal processes, such as court orders or official government channels, were seen as the appropriate threshold, not informal emails or unverifiable demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notification and Appeals: Fairness and Transparency&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the projects we consulted emphasized the importance of notifying developers whose apps are being targeted, informing them (if possible) of the seriousness of the claim, and the proposed strategy F-Droid is taking to handle the claim.Â&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a threat is deemed to be valid and a developerâs content is flagged for takedown:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The developer or maintainer is informed, unless prohibited by law (gag orders).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A window for response (commonly 14 days) is offered, unless unfeasible due to seriousness and time restraints of the request itself&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If the developer disputes the claim and provides supporting information (e.g. license, public domain status, fair use justification), the claim is reviewed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If the claim is upheld, the content is removed, but always with an internal record and opportunity to appeal.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mirrors principles embedded in international norms (like the Manila Principles and GitHubâs DMCA takedown policy) and avoids overcompliance with weak or abusive claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Transparency, Censorship, and What You Can (Legally) Publish&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takedown requests occupy a complex space between legal enforcement and censorship. While some are legitimate claims, like copyright violations or privacy breaches, others are vague, politically motivated, or intended to silence dissent. For FOSS projects that have a global user base, itâs not always obvious how to respond. Complying too quickly can reinforce censorship practices; resisting without process can lead to full website shut downs, domain names being taken away (as in the US) or large and costly legal battles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One strategy that helps balance this tension is radical transparency. Several projects we spoke with emphasized the importance of documenting what actions were taken and why, not just for accountability, but as a form of resistance. A well-known example is GitHubâs DMCA takedown policy (as of July 2025), which mandates compliance with valid takedown requests, but also posts each one publicly in their github/dmca repository. The result: potential abusers know their requests will face public scrutiny, which acts as a deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all jurisdictions allow this kind of transparency. In India, for example, we were informed that it is often illegal to disclose that you have received a government request, even to the developer of the affected app. In contrast, in Russia, takedown requests can often be legally posted, though by doing so you may be putting yourself at risk for retaliation, additional takedown requests and legal troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, some best practices for FOSS projects include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Publishing biannual transparency reports, even if redacted or aggregated.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Maintaining an internal log of all takedown activity, with public disclosure where legally possible.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Explaining the general reasons for content removals, who made the request, under what law, and what action was taken, unless legally prohibited.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Being explicit about what cannot be shared, and why.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency wonât prevent all forms of censorship, but it can slow them down, raise awareness, and provide a record that strengthens the broader FOSS ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Weâre Doing at F-Droid&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is revising its own takedown policy, informed by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Dutch law and EU regulations&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The structural support provided by The Commons Conservancy&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Practical lessons from long-standing FOSS organizations&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our draft process includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Written takedown submission request to legal@f-droid.org including the required information.:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Identify the specific material in question (e.g. app name)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Include valid legal basis under applicable jurisdiction (e.g. copyright law, court order statutory basis)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Indicate jurisdiction in which the legal basis is claimed to apply&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Include sufficient evidence of the alleged infringement (e.g. copyright certificate, ownership declaration)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Clearly state that the complaintant is authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Include full contact details and a verifiable identity (subject to exceptions, such as gag orders or whistleblower protection)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Verification of jurisdiction and legal basis, including evidence&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Developer notification and appeal procedures&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rejection of requests lacking documentation or legal authority may be rejected or ignored&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Biannual transparency reports and public tracking of takedown requests&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weâre also working to improve contributor education about potential exposure when contributing to F-Droid, document internal escalation paths, and ensure consistent handling of international claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takedown requests are not going away in fact, theyâre becoming more frequent and more complex. But FOSS projects donât have to face them unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By building processes, establishing clear jurisdiction, and protecting individuals through structure and policy, we can handle these challenges with the seriousness they deserve without letting them derail our mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Legal Disclaimer&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content provided in this article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you’ve been doing JavaScript for a while, you might be surprised to learn that &lt;code&gt;setTimeout(0)&lt;/code&gt; is not really &lt;code&gt;setTimeout(0)&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, it could run 4 milliseconds later:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;const start = performance.now() setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; { // Likely 4ms console.log(performance.now() - start) }, 0)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly a decade ago when I was on the Microsoft Edge team, it was explained to me that browsers did this to avoid “abuse.” I.e. there are a lot of websites out there that spam &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;, so to avoid draining the user’s battery or blocking interactivity, browsers set a special “clamped” minimum of 4ms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also explains why some browsers would bump the throttling for devices on battery power (16ms in the case of legacy Edge), or throttle even more aggressively for background tabs (1 second in Chrome!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One question always vexed me, though: if &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; was so abused, then why did browsers keep introducing new timers like &lt;code&gt;setImmediate&lt;/code&gt; (RIP), Promises, or even new fanciness like &lt;code&gt;scheduler.postTask()&lt;/code&gt;? If &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; had to be nerfed, then wouldn’t these timers suffer the same fate eventually?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a long post about JavaScript timers back in 2018, but until recently I didn’t have a good reason to revisit this question. Then I was doing some work on &lt;code&gt;fake-indexeddb&lt;/code&gt;, which is a pure-JavaScript implementation of the IndexedDB API, and this question reared its head. As it turns out, IndexedDB wants to auto-commit transactions when there’s no outstanding work in the event loop – in other words, after all microtasks have finished, but before any tasks (can I cheekily say “macro-tasks”?) have started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, &lt;code&gt;fake-indexeddb&lt;/code&gt; was using &lt;code&gt;setImmediate&lt;/code&gt; in Node.js (which shares some similarities with the legacy browser version) and &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; in the browser. In Node, &lt;code&gt;setImmediate&lt;/code&gt; is kind of perfect, because it runs after microtasks but immediately before any other tasks, and without clamping. In the browser, though, &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; is pretty sub-optimal: in one benchmark, I was seeing Chrome take 4.8 seconds for something that only took 300 milliseconds in Node (a 16x slowdown!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking out at the timer landscape in 2025, though, it wasn’t obvious what to choose. Some options included:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;setImmediate&lt;/code&gt;– only supported in legacy Edge and IE, so that’s a no-go.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MessageChannel.postMessage&lt;/code&gt;– this is the technique used by afterframe.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;window.postMessage&lt;/code&gt;– a nice idea, but kind of janky since it might interfere with other scripts on the page using the same API. This approach is used by the&lt;code&gt;setImmediate&lt;/code&gt;polyfill though.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;scheduler.postTask&lt;/code&gt;– if you read no further, this was the winner. But let’s explain why!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compare these options, I wrote a quick benchmark. A few important things about this benchmark:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You have to run several iterations of &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;(and friends) to really suss out the clamping. Technically, per the HTML specification, the 4ms clamping is only supposed to kick in after a&lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;has been nested (i.e. one&lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;calls another) 5 times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I didn’t test every possible combination of 1) battery vs plugged in, 2) monitor refresh rates, 3) background vs foreground tabs, etc., even though I know all of these things can affect the clamping. I have a life, and although it’s fun to don the lab coat and run some experiments, I don’t want to spend my entire Saturday doing that.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, here are the numbers (in milliseconds, median of 101 iterations, on a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Browser&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;MessageChannel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;scheduler.postTask&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Chrome 139&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4.2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.05&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.03&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.00&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Firefox 142&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4.72&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.02&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.01&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.01&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Safari 18.4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;26.73&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.52&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.05&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Not implemented&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: this benchmark was tricky to write! When I first wrote it, I used &lt;code&gt;Promise.all&lt;/code&gt; to run all the timers simultaneously, but this seemed to defeat Safari’s nesting heuristics, and made Firefox’s fire inconsistently. Now the benchmark runs each timer independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t worry about the precise numbers too much: the point is that Chrome and Firefox clamp &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; to 4ms, and the other three options are roughly equivalent. In Safari, interestingly, &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; is even more heavily throttled, and &lt;code&gt;MessageChannel.postMessage&lt;/code&gt; is a tad slower than &lt;code&gt;window.postMessage&lt;/code&gt; (although &lt;code&gt;window.postMessage&lt;/code&gt; is still janky for the reasons listed above).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This experiment answered my immediate question: &lt;code&gt;fake-indexeddb&lt;/code&gt; should use &lt;code&gt;scheduler.postTask&lt;/code&gt; (which I prefer for its ergonomics) and fall back to either &lt;code&gt;MessageChannel.postMessage&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;window.postMessage&lt;/code&gt;. (I did experiment with different priorities for &lt;code&gt;postTask&lt;/code&gt;, but they all performed almost identically. For &lt;code&gt;fake-indexeddb&lt;/code&gt;‘s use case, the default priority of &lt;code&gt;'user-visible'&lt;/code&gt; seemed most appropriate, and that’s what the benchmark uses.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of this answered my original question, though: why exactly do browsers bother to throttle &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; if web developers can just use &lt;code&gt;scheduler.postTask&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MessageChannel&lt;/code&gt; instead? I asked my friend Todd Reifsteck, who was co-chair of the Web Performance Working Group back when a lot of these discussions about “interventions” were underway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said that there were effectively two camps: one camp felt that timers needed to be throttled to protect web devs from themselves, whereas the other camp felt that developers should “measure their own silliness,” and that any subtle throttling heuristics would just cause confusion. In short, it was the standard tradeoff in designing performance APIs: “some APIs are quick but come with footguns.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This jives with my own intuitions on the topic. Browser interventions are usually put in place because web developers have either used too much of a good thing (e.g. &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;), or were blithely unaware of better options (the touch listener controversy is a good example). In the end, the browser is a “user agent” acting on the user’s behalf, and the W3C’s priority of constituencies makes it clear that end-user needs always trump web developer needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, web developers often do want to do the right thing. (I consider this blog post an attempt in that direction.) We just don’t always have the tools to do it, so instead we grab whatever blunt instrument is nearby and start swinging. Giving us more control over tasks and scheduling could avoid the need to hammer away with &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; and cause a mess that calls for an intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My prediction is that &lt;code&gt;postTask&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt; will remain unthrottled for the time being. Out of Todd’s two “camps,” the very existence of the Scheduler API, which offers a whole slew of fine-grained tools for task scheduling, seems to point toward the “pro-control” camp as the one currently steering the ship. Although Todd sees the API more as a compromise between the two groups: yes, it offers a lot of control, but it also aligns with the browser’s actual rendering pipeline rather than random timeouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pessimist in me wonders, though, if the API could still be abused – e.g. by carelessly using the &lt;code&gt;user-blocking&lt;/code&gt; priority everywhere. Perhaps in the future, some enterprising browser vendor will put their foot more firmly on the throttle (so to speak) and discover that it causes websites to be snappier, more responsive, and less battery-draining. If that happens, then we may see another round of interventions. (Maybe we’ll need a &lt;code&gt;scheduler2&lt;/code&gt; API to dig ourselves out of that mess!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not involved much in web standards anymore and can only speculate. For the time being, I’ll just do what most web devs do: choose whatever API accomplishes my goals today, and hope that browsers don’t change too much in the future. As long as we’re careful and don’t introduce too much “silliness,” I don’t think that’s a lot to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Todd Reifsteck for feedback on a draft of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: everything I said about &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; could also be said about &lt;code&gt;setInterval&lt;/code&gt;. From the browser’s perspective, these are nearly the same APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: for what it’s worth, &lt;code&gt;fake-indexeddb&lt;/code&gt; is still falling back to &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;MessageChannel&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;window.postMessage&lt;/code&gt; in Safari. Despite my benchmarks above, I was only able to get &lt;code&gt;window.postMessage&lt;/code&gt; to outperform the other two in &lt;code&gt;fake-indexeddb&lt;/code&gt;‘s own benchmark – Safari seems to have some additional throttling for &lt;code&gt;MessageChannel&lt;/code&gt; that my standalone benchmark couldn’t suss out. And &lt;code&gt;window.postMessage&lt;/code&gt; still seems error-prone to me, so I’m reluctant to use it. Here is my benchmark for those curious.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;EU Court Rules Nuclear Energy is Clean Energy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WePlanet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5 minutes ago&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3 min read&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I launched Dear Greenpeace with my fellow youth climate activists alongside WePlanet two years ago, I had no idea just how quickly the anti-nuclear dominoes would fall across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, and what seems like a lifetime ago, Austria launched their legal action against the European Commission for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy. At the time they were supported by a bulwark of EU countries and environmental NGOs that opposed nuclear energy. Honestly, it looked like they might win.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But today, that whole landscape has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Germany, long a symbol of anti-nuclear politics, is beginning to shift. The nuclear phase-outs or bans in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, and Italy are now history. Even Fridays for Future has quietened its opposition, and in some places, embraced nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This moment matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It shows what’s possible when we stick to the science. The evidence only gets clearer by the day that nuclear energy has an extremely low environmental impact across its lifecycle, and strong regulations and safety culture ensure that it remains one of the safest forms of energy available to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Court of Justice has now fully dismissed Austria’s lawsuit. That ruling doesn’t just uphold nuclear energy’s place in EU green finance rules. It also signals a near-certain defeat for the ongoing Greenpeace case – the very lawsuit that inspired me to launch Dear Greenpeace in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But instead of learning from this, Greenpeace is doubling down. Martin Kaiser, Executive Director of Greenpeace Germany, called the court decision “a dark day for the climate”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let that sink in. The highest court in the EU just reaffirmed that nuclear energy meets the scientific and environmental standards to be included in sustainable finance, and Greenpeace still refuses to budge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the climate crisis gets worse. Global emissions are not falling fast enough. Billions of people still lack access to clean, reliable electricity. And we are forced to spend time defending proven solutions instead of scaling them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s now up to the court whether we will get our time in court to outline the evidence in support of nuclear energy and the important role it can play in the global clean energy transition. Whether in court, on the streets, or in the halls of parliaments across the globe, we will be there to defend the science and ensure that nuclear power can spread the advantages of the modern world across the planet in a sustainable, reliable and dignified way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Austria stands increasingly isolated among a handful of countries that still cling to their opposition to nuclear energy. Their defeat in this vital high stakes topic is a success not just for the nuclear movement, but for the global transition as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have made real progress. Together, we’ve helped defend nuclear power in the EU, overturned outdated policies at the World Bank, and secured more technology-neutral language at the UN. These wins are not abstract. They open the door to real investment, real projects, and real emissions cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the work is not done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We still need to overturn national nuclear bans, unlock more funding, and push democratic countries to support clean energy development abroad: especially where it is most needed to compete with Russia’s growing influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fight will not be done until every single country in the world can boast a clean, reliable energy grid, ready to maintain a modern dignified standard of living, for everyone, everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a great success for the movement and it would not have been possible without the financial support, time and energy given by people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Solidarity, Ia Aanstoot&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;UTF-8 is a Brilliant Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time I learned about UTF-8 encoding, I was fascinated by how well-thought and brilliantly it was designed to represent millions of characters from different languages and scripts, and still be backward compatible with ASCII.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically UTF-8 uses 32 bits and the old ASCII uses 7 bits, but UTF-8 is designed in such a way that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every ASCII encoded file is a valid UTF-8 file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every UTF-8 encoded file that has only ASCII characters is a valid ASCII file.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing a system that scales to millions of characters and still be compatible with the old systems that use just 128 characters is a brilliant design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: If you are already aware of the UTF-8 encoding, you can explore the UTF-8 Playground utility that I built to visualize UTF-8 encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Does UTF-8 Do It?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding designed to represent every character in the Unicode character set, encompassing characters from most of the world's writing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It encodes characters using one to four bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first 128 characters (&lt;code&gt;U+0000&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;U+007F&lt;/code&gt;) are encoded with a single byte, ensuring backward compatibility with ASCII, and this is the reason why a file with only ASCII characters is a valid UTF-8 file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other characters require two, three, or four bytes. The leading bits of the first byte determine the total number of bytes that represents the current character. These bits follow one of four specific patterns, which indicate how many continuation bytes follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;1st byte Pattern&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;# of bytes used&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Full byte sequence pattern&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0xxxxxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0xxxxxxx&lt;p&gt;(This is basically a regular ASCII encoded byte)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;110xxxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;110xxxxx 10xxxxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1110xxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11110xxx&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that the second, third, and fourth bytes in a multi-byte sequence always start with 10. This indicates that these bytes are continuation bytes, following the main byte.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining bits in the main byte, along with the bits in the continuation bytes, are combined to form the character's code point. A code point serves as a unique identifier for a character in the Unicode character set. A code point is typically represented in hexadecimal format, prefixed with "U+". For example, the code point for the character "A" is &lt;code&gt;U+0041&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here is how a software determines the character from the UTF-8 encoded bytes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read a byte. If it starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, it's a single-byte character (ASCII). Show the character represented by the remaiing 7 bits on the screen. Continue with the next byte.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the byte didn't start with a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, then:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If it starts with &lt;code&gt;110&lt;/code&gt;, it's a two-byte character, so read the next byte as well.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If it starts with &lt;code&gt;1110&lt;/code&gt;, it's a three-byte character, so read the next two bytes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If it starts with &lt;code&gt;11110&lt;/code&gt;, it's a four-byte character, so read the next three bytes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If it starts with &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once the number of bytes are determined, read all the remaining bits except the leading bits, and find the binary value (aka. code point) of the character.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Look up the code point in the Unicode character set to find the corresponding character and display it on the screen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read the next byte and repeat the process.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example: Hindi Letter "अ" (open in UTF-8 Playground)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hindi letter "अ" (officially "Devanagari Letter A") is represented in UTF-8 as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;11100000 10100100 10000101 Here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first byte 11100000 indicates that the character is encoded using 3 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining bits of the three bytes: xxxx0000 xx100100 xx000101 are combined to form the binary sequence 00001001 00000101 (&lt;code&gt;0x0905&lt;/code&gt; in hexadecimal). This is the code point of the character, represented as &lt;code&gt;U+0905&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code point &lt;code&gt;U+0905&lt;/code&gt; (see official chart) represents the Hindi letter "अ" in the Unicode character set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example Text Files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we understood the design of UTF-8, let's look at a file that contains the following text:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Text file contains: &lt;code&gt;Hey👋 Buddy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The text &lt;code&gt;Hey👋 Buddy&lt;/code&gt; has both English characters and an emoji character on it. The text file with this text saved on the disk will have the following 13 bytes in it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;01001000 01100101 01111001 11110000 10011111 10010001 10001011 00100000 01000010 01110101 01100100 01100100 01111001&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's evaluate this file byte-by-byte following the UTF-8 decoding rules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Byte&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Explanation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01001000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1001000&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'H'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100101&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100101&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'e'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01111001&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1111001&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11110000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;11110&lt;/code&gt;, indicating it's the first byte of a four-byte character.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10011111&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, indicating it's a continuation byte.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10010001&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, indicating it's a continuation byte.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10001011&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, indicating it's a continuation byte.&lt;p&gt;The bits from these four bytes (excluding the leading bits) combine to form the binary sequence 00001 11110100 01001011, which is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1F44B&lt;/code&gt; in hexadecimal, corresponds to the code point &lt;code&gt;U+1F44B&lt;/code&gt;. This code point represents the waving hand emoji "👋" in the Unicode character set (open in playground).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;00100000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;0100000&lt;/code&gt; represent a whitespace character. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01000010&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1000010&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'B'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01110101&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1110101&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'u'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100100&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100100&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100100&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100100&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01111001&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1111001&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now this is a valid UTF-8 file, but it doesn't have to be "backward compatible" with ASCII because it contains a non-ASCII character (the emoji). Next let's create a file that contains only ASCII characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Text file contains: &lt;code&gt;Hey Buddy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The text file doesn't have any non-ASCII characters. The file saved on the disk has the following 9 bytes in it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;01001000 01100101 01111001 00100000 01000010 01110101 01100100 01100100 01111001&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's evaluate this file byte-by-byte following the UTF-8 decoding rules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Byte&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Explanation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01001000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1001000&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'H'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100101&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100101&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'e'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01111001&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1111001&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;00100000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;0100000&lt;/code&gt; represent a whitespace character. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01000010&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1000010&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'B'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01110101&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1110101&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'u'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100100&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100100&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100100&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100100&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01111001&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1111001&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this is a valid UTF-8 file, and it is also a valid ASCII file. The bytes in this file follows both the UTF-8 and ASCII encoding rules. This is how UTF-8 is designed to be backward compatible with ASCII.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other Encodings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a quick research on any other encoding that are backward compatible with ASCII, and there are a few, but they are not as popular as UTF-8, for example GB 18030 (a Chinese government standard). Another one is the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings are single-byte encodings that extend ASCII to include additional characters, but they are limited to 256 characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The siblings of UTF-8, like UTF-16 and UTF-32, are not backward compatible with ASCII. For example, the letter 'A' in UTF-16 is represented as: &lt;code&gt;00 41&lt;/code&gt; (two bytes), while in UTF-32 it is represented as: &lt;code&gt;00 00 00 41&lt;/code&gt; (four bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus: UTF-8 Playground&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was exploring the UTF-8 encoding, I couldn't find any good tool to interactively visualize how UTF-8 encoding works. So I built UTF-8 Playground to visualize and play around with UTF-8 encoding. Give it a try!.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Emacs: a paradigm shift&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I read this beginners guide to extend Emacs. The guide is perfect for starting out with elisp and it shows a lot of care in teaching how to interact with Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, the most important bit though is this one, from the section aptly named Emacs Wants You to Extend It.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I havenât written plugins for other editors extensively, but I can tell you this: emacs doesnât just make deep customization available, but it actively encourages you to make an absolute customization messes masterpieces. Core editor functions arenât just documented, but often include tidbits about âyou probably want to see this other variableâ or âhereâs how you should use thisâ.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not only that, but emacs happily hands you functions shaped like nuclear warheads like advice-add (that let you override any function) that can absolutely obliterate your editor if you hold it the wrong way. Of course, this also grants you unlimited power.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember that emacs is designed to be torn apart and rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the core bit of the argument. Emacs, as a system, wants you to extend it and it gives you all the means to do so. This is in contrast with systems that can be extended through scripting and instead donât give you all the means to do so!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the tutorial is a fantastic example of doing things right. There is a well-thought example, a constructive approach where the solution grows to a full package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is problematic. You may get the impression that extending Emacs is only possible if you do things right and that is definitely not true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make my point I want to walk you through an example. I will show you how I used standard Emacs extension-points to extend org-mode to sort my reading lists automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What do I want?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The behavior I want is that when I save an org file the entries are ordered automatically. I keep a timeline of the papers I am reading and it is annoying to keep them kind of ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the content of an example buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I add a paper to my reading list I run &lt;code&gt;org-sort-entries&lt;/code&gt; and
interactively select to order the entries by the value in the property
&lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt;. Initally this was nice to have but now itâs just annoying that
I have to keep doing it. Letâs extend org-mode so that this is done automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A simple solution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step is to automate the interactive part. Lucky for me this is easy as &lt;code&gt;org-sort-entries&lt;/code&gt; is both a function and a command. I can call it in a
script just as I can run it as a command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This solves one part of the problem. Letâs solve the other one, automatically calling &lt;code&gt;org-sort-run&lt;/code&gt; whenever an org-mode buffer is saved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emacs already has support for this use-case through the use of hooks. We can run &lt;code&gt;org-sort-run&lt;/code&gt; all the times we want to save a buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two together solve the problem but the solution presented is âjust more codeâ. We tapped into the hook extension point but this would be possible in any scriptable system that exposes well-defined extension points such as hooks and commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Leveraging Emacsâ extensibility to extend org-mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to show that even if something is not thought with extensibility in mind Emacs allow us to extend it. Most importantly, while we want to extend org-modeâs behavior we would like this not to be an extension to org-modeâs code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs the updated problem statement. Have the buffer be automatically sorted and have the sorting criteria be in the buffer itself. We will specify the sorting as a in-buffer setting and use Emacs to support this never thought before org-mode behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our example buffer changes to the following.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hard part of this is to find how org-mode reads in-buffer settings from the header. A M-x find-library later we are in orgâs sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching for &lt;code&gt;+STARTUP&lt;/code&gt; (Ctrl+s +STARTUP), one of the
supported settings, leads us to &lt;code&gt;org-startup-folded&lt;/code&gt; and that in turn
(Ctrl+s org-startup-folded) leads us to &lt;code&gt;org-startup-options&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;org-startup-options&lt;/code&gt; is the used by (again Ctrl+s org-startup-option)
&lt;code&gt;org-set-regexps-and-options&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the documentation for this function is not very convincing, its code does make sense for what we are after. I copied it here for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this function calls &lt;code&gt;org-collect-keyword&lt;/code&gt; with a list that we cannot
touch. There is no custom variable to set to pass our own keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this was a ânormal programming environmentâ we would make our changes to this function body and forever maintain a fork of org-mode. As this is elisp instead we have choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the best choice is to use &lt;code&gt;advice-add&lt;/code&gt; and have Emacs call our
advice code every time &lt;code&gt;org-set-regexps-and-options&lt;/code&gt; is called. We will copy
what we need from the function body but that will be all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what I ended up with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We keep a buffer-local variable &lt;code&gt;org-sort-option&lt;/code&gt; around to store the
property name read from &lt;code&gt;#+SORT: property-name&lt;/code&gt;. This variable is initially
&lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; and will be set from the property name in &lt;code&gt;#+SORT: property-name&lt;/code&gt;. To do so
we have a function &lt;code&gt;org-sort-set-option&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when to call &lt;code&gt;org-sort-set-option&lt;/code&gt;? The easy way out is to have Emacs call it whenever
&lt;code&gt;org-set-regexps-and-options&lt;/code&gt; is called on a file visit. To achieve this we
tap into &lt;code&gt;advice-add&lt;/code&gt; and ask Emacs to run &lt;code&gt;org-sort-set-option&lt;/code&gt; after
&lt;code&gt;org-sort-regexps-and-options&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have now succesfully interposed ourselves in the control flow of the org-mode library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Org-mode did not provide any interposition point for us, there is no thought ahead etension-point or configuration variable we can use to achieve our goal an yet here we are with a sorted buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We succeeded in our effort because Emacs wants you to extend it and it gives you all the means to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have made a horrible hack and it works. I have learnt nothing about how org-mode works or Emacsâ file-visiting extension-points.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company behind the Proton Mail email service, Proton, describes itself as a “neutral and safe haven for your personal data, committed to defending your freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But last month, Proton disabled email accounts belonging to journalists reporting on security breaches of various South Korean government computer systems following a complaint by an unspecified cybersecurity agency. After a public outcry, and multiple weeks, the journalists’ accounts were eventually reinstated — but the reporters and editors involved still want answers on how and why Proton decided to shut down the accounts in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Martin Shelton, deputy director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, highlighted that numerous newsrooms use Proton’s services as alternatives to something like Gmail “specifically to avoid situations like this,” pointing out that “While it’s good to see that Proton is reconsidering account suspensions, journalists are among the users who need these and similar tools most.” Newsrooms like The Intercept, the Boston Globe, and the Tampa Bay Times all rely on Proton Mail for emailed tip submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shelton noted that perhaps Proton should “prioritize responding to journalists about account suspensions privately, rather than when they go viral.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Reddit, Proton’s official account stated that “Proton did not knowingly block journalists’ email accounts” and that the “situation has unfortunately been blown out of proportion.” Proton did not respond to The Intercept’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two journalists whose accounts were disabled were working on an article published in the August issue of the long-running hacker zine Phrack. The story described how a sophisticated hacking operation — what’s known in cybersecurity parlance as an APT, or advanced persistent threat — had wormed its way into a number of South Korean computer networks, including those of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military Defense Counterintelligence Command, or DCC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The journalists, who published their story under the names Saber and cyb0rg, describe the hack as being consistent with the work of Kimsuky, a notorious North Korean state-backed APT sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As they pieced the story together, emails viewed by The Intercept show that the authors followed cybersecurity best practices and conducted what’s known as responsible disclosure: notifying affected parties that a vulnerability has been discovered in their systems prior to publicizing the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Saber and cyb0rg created a dedicated Proton Mail account to coordinate the responsible disclosures, then proceeded to notify the impacted parties, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the DCC, and also notified South Korean cybersecurity organizations like the Korea Internet and Security Agency, and KrCERT/CC, the state-sponsored Computer Emergency Response Team. According to emails viewed by The Intercept, KrCERT wrote back to the authors, thanking them for their disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A note on cybersecurity jargon: CERTs are agencies consisting of cybersecurity experts specializing in dealing with and responding to security incidents. CERTs exist in over 70 countries — with some countries having multiple CERTs each specializing in a particular field such as the financial sector — and may be government-sponsored or private organizations. They adhere to a set of formal technical standards, such as being expected to react to reported cybersecurity threats and security incidents. A high-profile example of a CERT agency in the U.S. is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, which has recently been gutted by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A week after the print issue of Phrack came out, and a few days before the digital version was released, Saber and cyb0rg found that the Proton account they had set up for the responsible disclosure notifications had been suspended. A day later, Saber discovered that his personal Proton Mail account had also been suspended. Phrack posted a timeline of the account suspensions at the top of the published article, and later highlighted the timeline in a viral social media post. Both accounts were suspended owing to an unspecified “potential policy violation,” according to screenshots of account login attempts reviewed by The Intercept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The suspension notice instructed the authors to fill out Proton’s abuse appeals form if they believed the suspension was in error. Saber did so, and received a reply from a member of Proton Mail’s Abuse Team who went by the name Dante.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an email viewed by The Intercept, Dante told Saber that their account “has been disabled as a result of a direct connection to an account that was taken down due to violations of our terms and conditions while being used in a malicious manner.” Dante also provided a link to Proton’s terms of service, going on to state, “We have clearly indicated that any account used for unauthorized activities, will be sanctioned accordingly.” The response concluded by stating, “We consider that allowing access to your account will cause further damage to our service, therefore we will keep the account suspended.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On August 22, a Phrack editors reached out to Proton, writing that no hacked data was passed through the suspended email accounts, and asked if the account suspension incident could be deescalated. After receiving no response from Proton, the editor sent a follow-up email on September 6. Proton once again did not reply to the email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 9, the official Phrack X account made a post asking Proton’s official account asking why Proton was “cancelling journalists and ghosting us,” adding: “need help calibrating your moral compass?” The post quickly went viral, garnering over 150,000 views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proton’s official account replied the following day, stating that Proton had been “alerted by a CERT that certain accounts were being misused by hackers in violation of Proton’s Terms of Service. This led to a cluster of accounts being disabled. Our team is now reviewing these cases individually to determine if any can be restored.” Proton then stated that they “stand with journalists” but “cannot see the content of accounts and therefore cannot always know when anti-abuse measures may inadvertently affect legitimate activism.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proton did not publicly specify which CERT had alerted them, and didn’t answer The Intercept’s request for the name of the specific CERT which had sent the alert. KrCERT also did not reply to The Intercept’s question about whether they were the CERT that had sent the alert to Proton.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later in the day, Proton’s founder and CEO Andy Yen posted on X that the two accounts had been reinstated. Neither Yen nor Proton explained why the accounts had been reinstated, whether they had been found to not violate the terms of service after all, why had they been suspended in the first place, or why a member of the Proton Abuse Team reiterated that the accounts had violated the terms of service during Saber’s appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phrack noted that the account suspensions created a “real impact to the author. The author was unable to answer media requests about the article.” The co-authors, Phrack pointed out, were also in the midst of the responsible disclosure process and working together with the various affected South Korean organizations to help fix their systems. “All this was denied and ruined by Proton,” Phrack stated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phrack editors said that the incident leaves them “concerned what this means to other whistleblowers or journalists. The community needs assurance that Proton does not disable accounts unless Proton has a court order or the crime (or ToS violation) is apparent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not hyperbole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 98 runs surprisingly well in QEMU via UTM SE, but it requires some care in setting it up. It’s a great way to run old 90s Windows and DOS software on your iPad (and Mac too, though you have other options available to you, or an iPhone if you don’t mind the HID difficulties).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post provides some suggestions and tips for installing Windows and selecting the best emulated devices. The guidance is intended for UTM users on Apple platforms, but should apply to anything QEMU based (or QEMU itself). The advice might also be useful for other operating systems in UTM/QEMU as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Plug and play BIOS issues (or: how to install with ACPI)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you install Windows 9x, PCI devices might be broken, and you’ll see a Plug and Play BIOS device with problems in the device manager:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seems to be a bug in SeaBIOS or QEMU; I haven’t yet seen an issue tracking this. Many guides (i.e. this one or this one) suggest changing the device and hoping devices re-enumerate correctly. However, there’s a simpler method available when using Windows 98 SE. (If you’re using Windows 95, you won’t be able to do this.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 98 can use ACPI to enumerate devices instead of the legacy PnP BIOS. Unfortunately, it doesn’t use ACPI by default. (There seems to be an allowlist of known good ACPI BIOSes, as it was early days for ACPI.) To make it use ACPI anyways, boot with CD-ROM support from the Windows 98 CD instead of running the installer, then run Windows setup with the &lt;code&gt;/p j&lt;/code&gt; flag, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C:\&amp;gt; D:
D:\&amp;gt; cd WIN98
D:\WIN98&amp;gt; setup /p j&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible to convert an existing system to ACPI, but it’s much easier to do this from the start. When Windows is installed this way, it should correctly enumerate all devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Device selection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;System&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QEMU can emulate devices Windows 98 supports out of the box, which is good as there are no VirtIO drivers. Make sure you’re using the i440-based “&lt;code&gt;pc&lt;/code&gt;” rather than the Q35 based system, as it’ll be better supported for legacy systems. You don’t need to worry about selecting i386 vs. x86_64, as Windows 98 will obviously never touch 64-bit mode, so they’ll be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(As a tip, if you’re running NT 4, you’ll need to select a different CPU to make sure it’s happy with the CPU flags as the default one is too new. A Pentium II should be sufficiently old.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Input&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may need to disable USB (or at least, USB input devices) to avoid hanging on startup, at least with UTM (It’s possible the ‘Force PS/2 Controller’ option might work, but I haven’t had much luck with it. Unfortunately, this means you won’t have absolute mouse input (through the USB tablet) and must capture your cursor. With UTM SE on an iPad, this doesn’t hurt as much, as it can automatically capture the trackpad or external mouse, while leaving the touchscreen for interacting with iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Video&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most sensible video option for Windows 98 is the Cirrus VGA (&lt;code&gt;-vga cirrus&lt;/code&gt;). There are unfortunately some bugs (flashing in 16 bit colour modes, blitting issues in 8 bit colour modes), but it’s the only option with accelerated drivers out of the box. (Of course, there is no 3D acceleration with such a card.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently, Rage 128 emulation is being worked on (&lt;code&gt;ati-vga&lt;/code&gt;), but currently only works for Power Mac emulation, and is in rough shape so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Networking and getting files in&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For getting files into the VM easily, you’ll want a network. SLiRP NAT works fine for using a browser or SMB shares, for example. (Note this works better on Windows 98 than 95; 95 has issues with mounting SMB shares by IP and doesn’t come with a browser.) QEMU can emulate a variety of network cards. The tulip (DC2114x), NE2000 (PCI and ISA), and PCNet should all work out of the box with older Windows. I’d recommend using a PCI card if possible, since it saves you the ISA setup headache unless you need it for something old. If you do need to set up an ISA NE2000, it’s at address 300h, IRQ 9, which might require manual configuration in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sound&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sound hardware, there are a few options available, with different tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you want to run DOS software, the SoundBlaster 16 (&lt;code&gt;sb16&lt;/code&gt;) emulation works out of the box, but there is no OPL3 or MPU-401, so MIDI won’t work correctly, just PCM. Games will have a hard time with this unless they’re entirely PCM. For setting up your SB16 for DOS games, use&lt;code&gt;SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5 P330 T5&lt;/code&gt;(that’s address 220h, interrupt 5, 8-bit DMA 1, our non-existent MPU-401 at 330h, 16-bit DMA 5).&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Note that QEMU supports adding an AdLib (OPL2 based) separately, which might help with some software.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CS4321A I haven’t tested, but might work with WSS or Crystal-specific drivers. As with the SoundBlaster 16, there is no OPL3. QEMU sets this up at 534h, IRQ 9, DMA 3.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Gravis UltraSound (&lt;code&gt;gus&lt;/code&gt;) emulation works surprisingly well, but the Windows 95 drivers are crusty for the version of the card it emulates (GF1/GUS Classic), so use it only if you want to run old trackers or demoscene stuff. Note you may need to turn off the LPT port (&lt;code&gt;-parallel none&lt;/code&gt;) to free up an interrupt used for the UltraSound.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Because of this, the ES1370 might be the best card to emulate for plain Windows usage, as it has relatively few quirks and I believe has drivers on the Windows 98 CD. However, it’s not ideal for DOS software as it requires TSRs to make it work right.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The AC97 emulation will require Realtek drivers. I haven’t tested this.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Potpourri&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In UTM, you may want to turn off the entropy device, to reduce unknown device clutter in Device Manager, though it’s harmless. The VirtIO console device will still be present in Device Manager with UTM’s default flags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other quirks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In UTM SE, sometimes rebooting might hang when switching video modes. If this happens, it seems safe to shut down the machine and start it again. Avoiding reboots in favour of shutting down seems wise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Performance characteristics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While TCG in QEMU doesn’t have the best reputation for performance, it might be good enough for your needs. On my MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro, benchmarks show performance somewhat around about a 750 MHz Pentium III, albeit with worse floating point performance. This is pretty usable, although most 3D games won’t be usable as even software rendering will be a bit sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re using UTM SE on iOS, the interpreter is slower, but not unusable for 90s software. On my M1 iPad Pro, I get Pentium 100 performance, with similar penalties for FP. This is good for games up to about 1995 or 1996; titles like MechWarrior 2, Widget Workshop, many edutainment titles, and SimCity 2000 are playable this way, though MIDI or CD music will be missing. Non-game software like Office 97 or Visual C++ will run fine, of course. For OSes, this also puts things like Windows 2000 and beyond just out of reach performance wise – stick with Windows 98 for the best compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
