  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey HN, Chris and Yuhong here from Onyx (&lt;/p&gt;https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx&lt;p&gt;). We’re building an open-source chat that works with any LLM (proprietary + open weight) &lt;/p&gt;and&lt;p&gt; gives these LLMs the tools they need to be useful (RAG, web search, MCP, deep research, memory, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demo: https://youtu.be/2g4BxTZ9ztg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Yuhong and I had the same recurring problem. We were on growing teams and it was ridiculously difficult to find the right information across our docs, Slack, meeting notes, etc. Existing solutions required sending out our company's data, lacked customization, and frankly didn't work well. So, we started Danswer, an open-source enterprise search project built to be self-hosted and easily customized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the project grew, we started seeing an interesting trend—even though we were explicitly a search app, people wanted to use Danswer just to chat with LLMs. We’d hear, “the connectors, indexing, and search are great, but I’m going to start by connecting GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Qwen to provide my team with a secure way to use them”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many users would add RAG, agents, and custom tools later, but much of the usage stayed ‘basic chat’. We thought: “why would people co-opt an enterprise search when other AI chat solutions exist?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we continued talking to users, we realized two key points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) just giving a company secure access to an LLM with a great UI and simple tools is a huge part of the value add of AI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) providing this well is much harder than you might think and the bar is incredibly high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer products like ChatGPT and Claude already provide a great experience—and chat with AI for work is something (ideally) everyone at the company uses 10+ times per day. People expect the same snappy, simple, and intuitive UX with a full feature set. Getting hundreds of small details right to take the experience from “this works” to “this feels magical” is not easy, and nothing else in the space has managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So ~3 months ago we pivoted to Onyx, the open-source chat UI with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- (truly) world class chat UX. Usable both by a fresh college grad who grew up with AI and an industry veteran who’s using AI tools for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Support for all the common add-ons: RAG, connectors, web search, custom tools, MCP, assistants, deep research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- RBAC, SSO, permission syncing, easy on-prem hosting to make it work for larger enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through building features like deep research and code interpreter that work across model providers, we've learned a ton of non-obvious things about engineering LLMs that have been key to making Onyx work. I'd like to share two that were particularly interesting (happy to discuss more in the comments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, context management is one of the most difficult and important things to get right. We’ve found that LLMs really struggle to remember both system prompts and previous user messages in long conversations. Even simple instructions like “ignore sources of type X” in the system prompt are very often ignored. This is exacerbated by multiple tool calls, which can often feed in huge amounts of context. We solved this problem with a “Reminder” prompt—a short 1-3 sentence blurb injected at the end of the user message that describes the non-negotiables that the LLM must abide by. Empirically, LLMs attend most to the very end of the context window, so this placement gives the highest likelihood of adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we’ve needed to build an understanding of the “natural tendencies” of certain models when using tools, and build around them. For example, the GPT family of models are fine-tuned to use a python code interpreter that operates in a Jupyter notebook. Even if told explicitly, it refuses to add `print()` around the last line, since, in Jupyter, this last line is automatically written to stdout. Other models don’t have this strong preference, so we’ve had to design our model-agnostic code interpreter to also automatically `print()` the last bare line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve had a Fortune 100 team fork Onyx and provide 10k+ employees access to every model within a single interface, and create thousands of use-case specific Assistants for every department, each using the best model for the job. We’ve seen teams operating in sensitive industries completely airgap Onyx w/ locally hosted LLMs to provide a copilot that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to try Onyx out, follow https://docs.onyx.app/deployment/getting_started/quickstart to get set up locally w/ Docker in &amp;lt;15 minutes. For our Cloud: https://www.onyx.app/. If there’s anything you'd like to see to make it a no-brainer to replace your ChatGPT Enterprise/Claude Enterprise subscription, we’d love to hear it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FLUX.2: Frontier Visual Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;News&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 is designed for real-world creative workflows, not just demos or party tricks. It generates high-quality images while maintaining character and style consistency across multiple reference images, following structured prompts, reading and writing complex text, adhering to brand guidelines, and reliably handling lighting, layouts, and logos. FLUX.2 can edit images at up to 4 megapixels while preserving detail and coherence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Black Forest Labs: Open Core&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe visual intelligence should be shaped by researchers, creatives, and developers everywhere, not just a few. That’s why we pair frontier capability with open research and open innovation, releasing powerful, inspectable, and composable open-weight models for the community, alongside robust, production-ready endpoints for teams that need scale, reliability, and customization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we launched Black Forest Labs in 2024, we set out to make open innovation sustainable, building on our experience developing some of the world’s most popular open models. We’ve combined open models like FLUX.1 [dev]—the most popular open image model globally—with professional-grade models like FLUX.1 Kontext [pro], which powers teams from Adobe to Meta and beyond. Our open core approach drives experimentation, invites scrutiny, lowers costs, and ensures that we can keep sharing open technology from the Black Forest and the Bay into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From FLUX.1 to FLUX.2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Precision, efficiency, control, extreme realism - where FLUX.1 showed the potential of media models as powerful creative tools, FLUX.2 shows how frontier capability can transform production workflows. By radically changing the economics of generation, FLUX.2 will become an indispensable part of our creative infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output Versatility: FLUX.2 is capable of generating highly detailed, photoreal images along with infographics with complex typography, all at resolutions up to 4MP&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s New&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Reference Support: Reference up to 10 images simultaneously with the best character / product / style consistency available today.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image Detail &amp;amp; Photorealism: Greater detail, sharper textures, and more stable lighting suitable for product shots, visualization, and photography-like use cases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text Rendering: Complex typography, infographics, memes and UI mockups with legible fine text now work reliably in production.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enhanced Prompt Following: Improved adherence to complex, structured instructions, including multi-part prompts and compositional constraints.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;World Knowledge: Significantly more grounded in real-world knowledge, lighting, and spatial logic, resulting in more coherent scenes with expected behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Higher Resolution &amp;amp; Flexible Input/Output Ratios: Image editing on resolutions up to 4MP.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All variants of FLUX.2 offer image editing from text and multiple references in one model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Available Now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FLUX.2 family covers a spectrum of model products, from fully managed, production-ready APIs to open-weight checkpoints developers can run themselves. The overview graph below shows how FLUX.2 [pro], FLUX.2 [flex], FLUX.2 [dev], and FLUX.2 [klein] balance performance, and control&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FLUX.2 [pro]: State-of-the-art image quality that rivals the best closed models, matching other models for prompt adherence and visual fidelity while generating images faster and at lower cost. No compromise between speed and quality. → Available now at BFL Playground, the BFL API and via our launch partners.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FLUX.2 [flex]: Take control over model parameters such as the number of steps and the guidance scale, giving developers full control over quality, prompt adherence and speed. This model excels at rendering text and fine details. → Available now at bfl.ai/play , the BFL API and via our launch partners.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FLUX.2 [dev]: 32B open-weight model, derived from the FLUX.2 base model. The most powerful open-weight image generation and editing model available today, combining text-to-image synthesis and image editing with multiple input images in a single checkpoint. FLUX.2 [dev] weights are available on Hugging Face and can now be used locally using our reference inference code. On consumer grade GPUs like GeForce RTX GPUs you can use an optimized fp8 reference implementation of FLUX.2 [dev], created in collaboration with NVIDIA and ComfyUI. You can also sample Flux.2 [dev] via API endpoints on FAL, Replicate, Runware, Verda, TogetherAI, Cloudflare, DeepInfra. For a commercial license, visit our website.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FLUX.2 [klein] (coming soon): Open-source, Apache 2.0 model, size-distilled from the FLUX.2 base model. More powerful &amp;amp; developer-friendly than comparable models of the same size trained from scratch, with many of the same capabilities as its teacher model. Join the beta&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FLUX.2 - VAE: A new variational autoencoder for latent representations that provide an optimized trade-off between learnability, quality and compression rate. This model provides the foundation for all FLUX.2 flow backbones, and an in-depth report describing its technical properties is available here. The FLUX.2 - VAE is available on HF under an Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generating designs with variable steps: FLUX.2 [flex] provides a “steps” parameter, trading off typography accuracy and latency. From left to right: 6 steps, 20 steps, 50 steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Controlling image detail with variable steps: FLUX.2 [flex] provides a “steps” parameter, trading off image detail and latency. From left to right: 6 steps, 20 steps, 50 steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FLUX.2 model family delivers state-of-the-art image generation quality at extremely competitive prices, offering the best value across performance tiers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For open-weights image models, FLUX.2 [dev] sets a new standard, achieving leading performance across text-to-image generation, single-reference editing, and multi-reference editing, consistently outperforming all open-weights alternatives by a significant margin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether open or closed, we are committed to the responsible development of these models and services before, during, and after every release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How It Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 builds on a latent flow matching architecture, and combines image generation and editing in a single architecture. The model couples the Mistral-3 24B parameter vision-language model with a rectified flow transformer. The VLM brings real world knowledge and contextual understanding, while the transformer captures spatial relationships, material properties, and compositional logic that earlier architectures could not render.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 now provides multi-reference support, with the ability to combine up to 10 images into a novel output, an output resolution of up to 4MP, substantially better prompt adherence and world knowledge, and significantly improved typography. We re-trained the model’s latent space from scratch to achieve better learnability and higher image quality at the same time, a step towards solving the “Learnability-Quality-Compression” trilemma. Technical details can be found in the FLUX.2 VAE blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More Resources:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Into the New&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building foundational infrastructure for visual intelligence, technology that transforms how the world is seen and understood. FLUX.2 is a step closer to multimodal models that unify perception, generation, memory, and reasoning, in an open and transparent way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The easiest way to make internet money. &lt;lb/&gt; Get Started &lt;lb/&gt; · Quickstart · Website · Issues · Discord &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infinite pricing models, one source of truth, zero webhooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Default Stateless Say goodbye to webhooks, &lt;code&gt;"subscriptions"&lt;/code&gt;db tables,&lt;code&gt;customer_id&lt;/code&gt;columns,&lt;code&gt;PRICE_ID&lt;/code&gt;env variables, or manually mapping your plans to prices to features and back.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single Source of Truth: Read your latest customer billing state from Flowglad, including feature access and usage meter credits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access Data Using Your Ids: Query customer state by your auth's user ids. Refer to prices, features, and usage meters via slugs you define.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full-Stack SDK: Access your customer's data on the backend using &lt;code&gt;flowgladServer.getBilling()&lt;/code&gt;, or in your React frontend using our&lt;code&gt;useBilling()&lt;/code&gt;hook&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adaptable: Iterate on new pricing models in testmode, and push them to prod in a click. Seamlessly rotate pricing models in your app without any redeployment.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, install the packages necessary Flowglad packages based on your project setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Next.js Projects
bun add @flowglad/nextjs

# React + Express projects:
bun add @flowglad/react @flowglad/express

# All other React + Node Projects
bun add @flowglad/react @flowglad/server&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flowglad integrates seamlessly with your authentication system and requires only a few lines of code to get started in your Next.js app. Setup typically takes under a minute:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configure Your Flowglad Server Client&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a utility to generate your Flowglad server instance. Pass your own customer/user/organization IDs—Flowglad never requires its own customer IDs to be managed in your app:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// utils/flowglad.ts
import { FlowgladServer } from '@flowglad/nextjs/server'

export const flowglad = (customerExternalId: string) =&amp;gt; {
  return new FlowgladServer({
    customerExternalId,
    getCustomerDetails: async (externalId) =&amp;gt; {
      // e.g. Fetch user info from your DB using your user/org/team ID
      const user = await db.users.findOne({ id: externalId })
      if (!user) throw new Error('User not found')
      return { email: user.email, name: user.name }
    },
  })
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expose the Flowglad API Handler&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add an API route so the Flowglad client can communicate securely with your backend:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// app/api/flowglad/[...path]/route.ts
import { nextRouteHandler } from '@flowglad/nextjs/server'
import { flowglad } from '@/utils/flowglad'

export const { GET, POST } = nextRouteHandler({
  flowglad,
  getCustomerExternalId: async (req) =&amp;gt; {
    // Extract your user/org/team ID from session/auth.
    // For B2C: return user.id from your DB
    // For B2B: return organization.id or team.id
    const userId = await getUserIdFromRequest(req)
    if (!userId) throw new Error('User not authenticated')
    return userId
  },
})&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wrap Your App with the Provider&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In your root layout (App Router) or _app (Pages Router):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { FlowgladProvider } from '@flowglad/nextjs'

// App Router example (app/layout.tsx)
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    &amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;FlowgladProvider loadBilling={true}&amp;gt;
          {children}
        &amp;lt;/FlowgladProvider&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it—Flowglad will use your app’s internal user IDs for all billing logic and integrate billing status into your frontend in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B2C apps: Use &lt;code&gt;user.id&lt;/code&gt; as the customer ID.&lt;lb/&gt; B2B apps: Use &lt;code&gt;organization.id&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;team.id&lt;/code&gt; as the customer ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flowglad does not require you to change your authentication system or manage Flowglad customer IDs. Just pass your own!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;useBilling&lt;/code&gt;on your frontend, and&lt;code&gt;flowglad(userId).getBilling()&lt;/code&gt;on your backend&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;'use client'

import { useBilling } from '@flowglad/nextjs'

export function FeatureGate({ featureSlug, children }) {
  const { loaded, errors, checkFeatureAccess } = useBilling()

  if (!loaded || !checkFeatureAccess) {
    return &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Loading billing state…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  }

  if (errors?.length) {
    return &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unable to load billing data right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  }

  return checkFeatureAccess(featureSlug)
    ? children
    : &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You need to upgrade to unlock this feature.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { useBilling } from '@flowglad/nextjs'

export function UsageBalanceIndicator({ usageMeterSlug }) {
  const { loaded, errors, checkUsageBalance, createCheckoutSession } = useBilling()

  if (!loaded || !checkUsageBalance) {
    return &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Loading usage…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  }

  const usage = checkUsageBalance(usageMeterSlug)

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Usage Balance&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        Remaining:{' '}
        {usage ? `${usage.availableBalance} credits available` : &amp;lt;button onClick={() =&amp;gt; createCheckoutSession({ 
            priceSlug: 'pro_plan',
            autoRedirect: true
          })}
        /&amp;gt;}
      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { flowglad } from '@/utils/flowglad'

const hasFastGenerations = async () =&amp;gt; {
  // ...
  const user = await getUser()

  const billing = await flowglad(user.id).getBilling()
  const hasAccess = billing.checkFeatureAccess('fast_generations')
  if (hasAccess) {
    // run fast generations
  } else {
    // fall back to normal generations
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { flowglad } from '@/utils/flowglad'

const processChatMessage = async (params: { chat: string }) =&amp;gt; {
  // Extract your app's user/org/team ID,
  // whichever corresponds to your customer
  const user = await getUser()

  const billing = await flowglad(user.id).getBilling()
  const usage = billing.checkUsageBalance('chat_messages')
  if (usage.availableBalance &amp;gt; 0) {
    // run chat request
  } else {
    throw Error(`User ${user.id} does not have sufficient usage credits`)
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, set up a pricing model. You can do so in the dashboard in just a few clicks using a template, that you can then customize to suit your specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We currently have templates for the following pricing models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Usage-limit + Subscription Hybrid (like Cursor)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unlimited Usage (like ChatGPT consumer)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tiered Access and Usage Credits (like Midjourney)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Feature-Gated Subscription (like Linear)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And more on the way. If you don't see a pricing model from our templates that suits you, you can always make one from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last 15 years, the market has given developers more options than ever for every single part of their stack. But when it comes to payments, there have been virtually zero new entrants. The existing options are slim, and almost all of them require us to talk to sales to even set up an account. When it comes to self-serve payments, there are even fewer options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result? The developer experience and cost of payments has barely improved in that time. Best in class DX in payments feels eerily suspended in 2015. Meanwhile, we've enjoyed constant improvements in auth, compute, hosting, and practically everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flowglad wants to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building a payments layer that lets you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Think about billing and payments as little as possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spend as little time on integration and maintenance as possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get as much out of your single integration as possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unlock more payment providers from a single integration&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Achieving this mission will take time. It will be hard. It might even make some people unhappy. But with AI bringing more and more developers on line and exploding the complexity of startup billing, the need is more urgent than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A New Bridge Links the Strange Math of Infinity to Computer Science&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of modern mathematics is built on the foundation of set theory, the study of how to organize abstract collections of objects. But in general, research mathematicians don’t need to think about it when they’re solving their problems. They can take it for granted that sets behave the way they’d expect, and carry on with their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descriptive set theorists are an exception. This small community of mathematicians never stopped studying the fundamental nature of sets — particularly the strange infinite ones that other mathematicians ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their field just got a lot less lonely. In 2023, a mathematician named Anton Bernshteyn published a deep and surprising connection between the remote mathematical frontier of descriptive set theory and modern computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He showed that all problems about certain kinds of infinite sets can be rewritten as problems about how networks of computers communicate. The bridge connecting the disciplines surprised researchers on both sides. Set theorists use the language of logic, computer scientists the language of algorithms. Set theory deals with the infinite, computer science with the finite. There’s no reason why their problems should be related, much less equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is something really weird,” said Václav Rozhoň, a computer scientist at Charles University in Prague. “Like, you are not supposed to have this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Bernshteyn’s result, his peers have been exploring how to move back and forth across the bridge to prove new theorems on either side, and how to extend that bridge to new classes of problems. Some descriptive set theorists are even starting to apply insights from the computer science side to reorganize the landscape of their entire field, and to rethink the way they understand infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This whole time we’ve been working on very similar problems without directly talking to each other,” said Clinton Conley, a descriptive set theorist at Carnegie Mellon University. “It just opens the doors to all these new collaborations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Broken Sets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn was an undergraduate when he first heard of descriptive set theory — as an example of a field that had once mattered, then decayed to nothing. More than a year would pass before he found out the professor had been wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2014, as a first-year graduate student at the University of Illinois, Bernshteyn took a logic course with Anush Tserunyan, who would later become one of his advisers. She corrected the misconception. “She should take all the credit for me being in this field,” he said. “She really made it seem that logic and set theory is this glue that connects all different parts of math.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descriptive set theory dates back to Georg Cantor, who proved in 1874 that there are different sizes of infinity. The set of whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, …), for instance, is the same size as the set of all fractions, but smaller than the set of all real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, mathematicians were deeply uncomfortable with this menagerie of different infinities. “It’s hard to wrap your head around,” said Bernshteyn, who is now at the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partly in response to that discomfort, mathematicians developed a different notion of size — one that described, say, how much length or area or volume a set might occupy, rather than the number of elements it contained. This notion of size is known as a set’s “measure” (in contrast to Cantor’s notion of size, which is a set’s “cardinality”). One of the simplest types of measure — the Lebesgue measure — quantifies a set’s length. While the set of real numbers between zero and 1 and the set of real numbers between zero and 10 are both infinite and have the same cardinality, the first has a Lebesgue measure of 1 and the second a Lebesgue measure of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To study more complicated sets, mathematicians use other types of measures. The uglier a set is, the fewer ways there are to measure it. Descriptive set theorists ask questions about which sets can be measured according to different definitions of “measure.” They then arrange them in a hierarchy based on the answers to those questions. At the top are sets that can be constructed easily and studied using any notion of measure you want. At the bottom are “unmeasurable” sets, which are so complicated they can’t be measured at all. “The word people often use is ‘pathological,’” Bernshteyn said. “Nonmeasurable sets are really bad. They’re counterintuitive, and they don’t behave well.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This hierarchy doesn’t just help set theorists map out the landscape of their field; it also gives them insights into what tools they can use to tackle more typical problems in other areas of math. Mathematicians in some fields, such as dynamical systems, group theory and probability theory, need information about the size of the sets they’re using. A set’s position in the hierarchy determines what tools they can use to solve their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descriptive set theorists are thus like librarians, tending to a massive bookshelf of different kinds of infinite sets (and the different ways of measuring them). Their job is to take a problem, determine how complicated a set its solution requires, and place it on the proper shelf, so that other mathematicians can take note.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making a Choice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn belongs to a group of librarians who sort problems about infinite sets of nodes connected by edges, called graphs. In particular, he studies graphs that have infinitely many separate pieces, each containing infinitely many nodes. Most graph theorists don’t study these kinds of graphs; they focus on finite ones instead. But such infinite graphs can represent and provide information about dynamical systems and other important kinds of sets, making them a major area of interest for descriptive set theorists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of the kind of infinite graph that Bernshteyn and his colleagues might study. Start with a circle, which contains infinitely many points. Pick one point: This will be your first node. Then move a fixed distance around the circle’s circumference. This gives you a second node. For example, you might move one-fifth of the way around the circle. Connect the two nodes with an edge. Move the same distance to a third node, and connect it to the previous one. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you move one-fifth of the way around the circle each time, it’ll take five steps to get back where you started. In general, if you move any distance that can be written as a fraction, the nodes will form a closed loop. But if the distance can’t be written as a fraction, the process will go on forever. You’ll get an infinite number of connected nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that’s not all: This infinitely long sequence forms only the first piece of your graph. Even though it contains infinitely many nodes, it doesn’t contain all the points on the circle. To generate the other pieces of the graph, start at one of those other points. Now move the same distance at each step as you did in the first piece. You’ll end up building a second infinite sequence of connected nodes, totally disconnected from the first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do this for every possible new starting point on the circle. You’ll get a graph consisting of infinitely many separate pieces, with each piece made of an infinite number of nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians can then ask whether it’s possible to color the nodes in this graph so that they obey certain rules. Using just two colors, for instance, can you color every node in the graph so that no two connected nodes are the same color? The solution might seem straightforward. Look at the first piece of your graph, pick a node, and color it blue. Then color the rest of the piece’s nodes in an alternating pattern: yellow, blue, yellow, blue. Do the same for every piece in your graph: Pick a node, color it blue, then alternate colors. Ultimately, you’ll use just two colors to achieve your task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But to accomplish this coloring, you had to rely on a hidden assumption that set theorists call the axiom of choice. It’s one of the nine fundamental building blocks from which all mathematical statements are constructed. According to this axiom, if you start with a bunch of sets, you can choose one item from each of those sets to create a new set — even if you have infinitely many sets to choose from. This axiom is useful, in that it allows mathematicians to prove all sorts of statements of interest. But it also leads to strange paradoxes. Descriptive set theorists avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your graph had infinitely many pieces. This corresponds to having infinitely many sets. You chose one item from each set — the first point you decided to color blue in each of the pieces. All those blue points formed a new set. You used the axiom of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which leads to a problem when you color the rest of the nodes in alternating patterns of blue and yellow. You’ve colored each node (which has zero length) separately, without any understanding of how nodes relate to one another when they come from different pieces of the graph. This means that you can’t describe the set of all the graph’s blue nodes, or the set of all its yellow nodes, in terms of length either. In other words, these sets are unmeasurable. Mathematicians can’t say anything useful about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To descriptive set theorists, this is unsatisfying. And so they want to figure out a way to color the graph in a continuous way — a way that doesn’t use the axiom of choice, and that gives them measurable sets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do this, remember how you built the first piece of your graph: You picked a node on a circle and connected it to a second node some distance away. Now color the first node blue, the second yellow, and the entire arc between them blue. Similarly, color the arc between the second and third nodes yellow. Color the third arc blue. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon, you’ll have made it almost completely around the circle — meaning that you’ve assigned a color to all the nodes in your graph except for the ones that fall in a small, leftover segment. Say the last arc you colored was yellow. How do you color this final, smaller segment? You can’t use blue, because these nodes will connect to nodes in the original arc you colored blue. But you also can’t use yellow, because these nodes connect back to yellow ones from the previous arc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to use a third color — say, green — to complete your coloring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, the sets of blue, yellow and green nodes you end up with are all just pieces of the circle’s circumference, rather than the scatterings of points you ended up with when you used the axiom of choice. You can calculate the lengths of these sets. They’re measurable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descriptive set theorists therefore place the two-color version of the problem on the lowest shelf in their hierarchy (for unmeasurable sets), while the three-color problem goes on a much higher shelf of problems — ones where lots of notions of measure can be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn spent his years in graduate school studying such coloring problems, shelving them one by one. Then, shortly after he finished his degree, he stumbled on a potential way to shelve them all at once — and to show that these problems have a much deeper and more mathematically relevant structure than anyone had realized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Round by Round&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From time to time, Bernshteyn enjoys going to computer science talks, where graphs are finite and represent networks of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2019, one of those talks changed the course of his career. It was about “distributed algorithms” — sets of instructions that run simultaneously on multiple computers in a network to accomplish a task without a central coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say you have a bunch of Wi-Fi routers in a building. Nearby routers can interfere with each other if they use the same communication frequency channel. So each router needs to choose a different channel from the ones used by its immediate neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computer scientists can reframe this as a coloring problem on a graph: Represent each router as a node, and connect nearby ones with edges. Using just two colors (representing two different frequency channels), find a way to color each node so that no two connected nodes are the same color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s a catch: Nodes can only communicate with their immediate neighbors, using so-called local algorithms. First, each node runs the same algorithm and assigns itself a color. It then communicates with its neighbors to learn how other nodes are colored in a small region around it. Then it runs the algorithm again to decide whether to keep its color or switch it. It repeats this step until the whole network has a proper coloring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computer scientists want to know how many steps a given algorithm requires. For example, any local algorithm that can solve the router problem with only two colors must be incredibly inefficient, but it’s possible to find a very efficient local algorithm if you’re allowed to use three.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the talk Bernshteyn was attending, the speaker discussed these thresholds for different kinds of problems. One of the thresholds, he realized, sounded a lot like a threshold that existed in the world of descriptive set theory — about the number of colors required to color certain infinite graphs in a measurable way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To Bernshteyn, it felt like more than a coincidence. It wasn’t just that computer scientists are like librarians too, shelving problems based on how efficiently their algorithms work. It wasn’t just that these problems could also be written in terms of graphs and colorings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps, he thought, the two bookshelves had more in common than that. Perhaps the connection between these two fields went much, much deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps all the books, and their shelves, were identical, just written in different languages — and in need of a translator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Opening the Door&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn set out to make this connection explicit. He wanted to show that every efficient local algorithm can be turned into a Lebesgue-measurable way of coloring an infinite graph (that satisfies some additional important properties). That is, one of computer science’s most important shelves is equivalent to one of set theory’s most important shelves (high up in the hierarchy).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He began with the class of network problems from the computer science lecture, focusing on their overarching rule — that any given node’s algorithm uses information about just its local neighborhood, whether the graph has a thousand nodes or a billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run properly, all the algorithm has to do is label each node in a given neighborhood with a unique number, so that it can log information about nearby nodes and give instructions about them. That’s easy enough to do in a finite graph: Just give every node in the graph a different number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Bernshteyn could run the same algorithm on an infinite graph, it meant he could color the graph in a measurable way — solving a graph-coloring question on the set theory side. But there was a problem: These infinite graphs are “uncountably” infinite. There’s no way to uniquely label all their nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn’s challenge was to find a cleverer way to label the graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He knew that he’d have to reuse labels. But that was fine so long as nearby nodes were labeled differently. Was there a way to assign labels without accidentally reusing one in the same neighborhood?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn showed that there is always a way — no matter how many labels you decide to use, and no matter how many nodes your local neighborhood has. This means that you can always safely extend the algorithm from the computer science side to the set theory side. “Any algorithm in our setup corresponds to a way of measurably coloring any graph in the descriptive set theory setup,” Rozhoň said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proof came as a surprise to mathematicians. It demonstrated a deep link between computation and definability, and between algorithms and measurable sets. Mathematicians are now exploring how to take advantage of Bernshteyn’s discovery. In a paper published this year, for instance, Rozhoň and his colleagues figured out that it’s possible to color special graphs called trees by looking at the same problem in the computer science context. The result also illuminated which tools mathematicians might use to study the trees’ corresponding dynamical systems. “This is a very interesting experience, trying to prove results in a field where I don’t understand even the basic definitions,” Rozhoň said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians have also been working to translate problems in the other direction. In one case, they used set theory to prove a new estimate of how hard a certain class of problems is to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn’s bridge isn’t just about having a new tool kit for solving individual problems. It has also allowed set theorists to gain a clearer view of their field. There were lots of problems that they had no idea how to classify. In many cases, that’s now changed, because set theorists have computer scientists’ more organized bookshelves to guide them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn hopes this growing area of research will change how the working mathematician views set theorists’ work — that they’ll no longer see it as remote and disconnected from the real mathematical world. “I’m trying to change this,” he said. “I want people to get used to thinking about infinity.”&lt;/p&gt;

In this work, we investigate their self-attention maps can be reinterpreted as semantic label propagation kernels, providing robust pixel-level correspondences between relevant image regions. Extending this mechanism across frames yields a temporal propagation kernel that enables zero-shot object tracking via segmentation in videos. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time optimization strategies-DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting-in adapting diffusion features for robust and consistent label propagation. Building on these findings, we introduce DRIFT, a framework for object tracking in videos leveraging a pretrained image diffusion model with SAM-guided mask refinement, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;16 Statistical Process Control in &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we will learn how to perform statistical process control in Python, using statistical tools and &lt;code&gt;plotnine&lt;/code&gt; visualizations! Statistical Process Control refers to using statistics to (1) measure variation in product quality over time and (2) identify benchmarks to know when intervention is needed. Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Packages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Remember to install these packages using a terminal, if you haven't already!
!pip install pandas plotnine scipy&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll be using &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; for data manipulation, &lt;code&gt;plotnine&lt;/code&gt; for visualization, and &lt;code&gt;scipy&lt;/code&gt; for statistical functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Custom Functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This workshop uses custom functions from the &lt;code&gt;functions/&lt;/code&gt; directory. You may need both:
- &lt;code&gt;functions_distributions.py&lt;/code&gt; - for reliability and distribution functions
- &lt;code&gt;functions_process_control.py&lt;/code&gt; - for statistical process control functions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use these functions, you need to acquire them from the repository at github.com/timothyfraser/sigma/tree/main/functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the functions directory to your Python path&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import sys
import os
# Add the functions directory to Python path
sys.path.append('functions')  # or path to wherever you placed the functions folder&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have the functions available, you can import them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our Case&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For today’s workshop, we’re going to think about why quality control matters in a local economy, by examining the case of the Japanese Hot Springs bath economy! Hot springs, or onsen, are a major source of tourism and recreation for families in Japan, bringing residents from across the country every year to often rural communities where the right geological conditions have brought on naturally occurring hot springs. Restaurants, taxi and bus companies, and many service sector firms rely on their local onsen to bring in a steady stream (pun intended) of tourists to the local economy. So, it’s often in the best interest of onsen operators to keep an eye on the temperature, minerals, or other aspects of their hot springs baths to ensure quality control, to keep up their firm (and town’s!) reputation for quality rest and relaxation!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Onsen-goers often seek out specific types of hot springs, so it’s important for an onsen to actually provide what it advertises! Serbulea and Payyappallimana (2012) describe some of these benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperature: Onsen are divided into “Extra Hot Springs” (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;42°C&lt;/code&gt;), “Hot Springs” (&lt;code&gt;41~34°C&lt;/code&gt;), and “Warm Springs” (&lt;code&gt;33~25°C&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;pH: Onsen are classified into “Acidic” (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pH &amp;lt; 3&lt;/code&gt;), “Mildly Acidic” (&lt;code&gt;pH 3~6&lt;/code&gt;), “Neutral” (&lt;code&gt;pH 6~7.5&lt;/code&gt;), “Mildly alkaline” (&lt;code&gt;pH 7.5~8.5&lt;/code&gt;), and “Alkaline” (&lt;code&gt;pH &amp;gt; 8.5&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sulfur: Sulfur onsen typically have about 2mg of sulfur per 1kg of hot spring water; sulfur levels must exceed 1 mg to count as a Sulfur onsen. (It smells like rotten eggs!)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are decent examples of quality control metrics that onsen operators might want to keep tabs on!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve been hired to evaluate quality control at a local onsen in sunny Kagoshima prefecture! Every month, for 15 months, you systematically took 20 random samples of hot spring water and recorded its temperature, pH, and sulfur levels. How might you determine if this onsen is at risk of slipping out of one sector of the market (eg. Extra Hot!) and into another (just normal Hot Springs?).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s read in our data from &lt;code&gt;workshops/onsen.csv&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Add functions directory to path if not already there
import sys
if 'functions' not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append('functions')

from functions_distributions import density, tidy_density, approxfun

water = pd.read_csv('workshops/onsen.csv')
water.head(3)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;##    id  time  temp   ph  sulfur
## 0   1     1  43.2  5.1     0.0
## 1   2     1  45.3  4.8     0.4
## 2   3     1  45.5  6.2     0.9&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;16.1 Process Descriptive Statistics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s get a sense of our process by calculating some basic descriptive statistics. We’ll create a simple function to calculate the mean and standard deviation, which are fundamental to evaluating process variation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from pandas import Series
def describe(x: Series):
  x = Series(x)
  out = pd.DataFrame({
    'mean': [x.mean()],
    'sd': [x.std()],
  })
  out['caption'] = ("Process Mean: " + out['mean'].round(2).astype(str) +
                    " | SD: " + out['sd'].round(2).astype(str))
  return out

tab = describe(water['temp'])
tab&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;##     mean        sd                         caption
## 0  44.85  1.989501  Process Mean: 44.85 | SD: 1.99&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s apply this to our temperature data to see the overall process mean and variation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;16.2 Process Overview Visual&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process overview chart is one of the most important tools in SPC. It shows us how our process behaves over time, helping us identify patterns, trends, and potential issues. We’ll create a visualization that shows individual measurements, subgroup means, and the overall process average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;g1 = (ggplot(water, aes(x='time', y='temp', group='time')) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=water['temp'].mean()), color='lightgrey', size=3) +
  geom_jitter(height=0, width=0.25) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x='Time (Subgroup)', y='Temperature (Celsius)', subtitle='Process Overview', caption=tab['caption'][0]))

# Save the plot
g1.save('images/05_process_overview.png', width=8, height=6, dpi=100)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;g2 = (ggplot(water, aes(x='temp')) + geom_histogram(bins=15, color='white', fill='grey') + theme_void() + coord_flip())

# Save the plot
g2.save('images/05_process_histogram.png', width=8, height=6, dpi=100)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The histogram shows us the distribution of all temperature measurements, giving us insight into the overall process variation. This helps us understand if our process is centered and how much variation we’re seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;16.3 Subgroup (Within-Group) Statistics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In SPC, we often work with subgroups - small samples taken at regular intervals. This allows us to distinguish between common cause variation (inherent to the process) and special cause variation (due to specific events). Let’s calculate statistics for each subgroup to see how the process behaves over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;stat_s = (water.groupby('time').apply(lambda d: pd.Series({
  'xbar': d['temp'].mean(),
  'r': d['temp'].max() - d['temp'].min(),
  'sd': d['temp'].std(),
  'nw': len(d)
})).reset_index())
stat_s['df'] = stat_s['nw'] - 1
stat_s['sigma_s'] = ( (stat_s['df'] * (stat_s['sd']**2)).sum() / stat_s['df'].sum() )**0.5
stat_s['se'] = stat_s['sigma_s'] / (stat_s['nw']**0.5)
stat_s['upper'] = stat_s['xbar'].mean() + 3*stat_s['se']
stat_s['lower'] = stat_s['xbar'].mean() - 3*stat_s['se']
stat_s.head(3)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;##    time    xbar    r        sd    nw    df   sigma_s        se      upper      lower
## 0     1  44.635  4.2  1.342533  20.0  19.0  1.986174  0.444122  46.182366  43.517634
## 1     3  45.305  7.9  2.001440  20.0  19.0  1.986174  0.444122  46.182366  43.517634
## 2     5  44.765  5.9  1.628133  20.0  19.0  1.986174  0.444122  46.182366  43.517634&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we’ve calculated key statistics for each subgroup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;xbar: The mean of each subgroup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;r: The range (max - min) within each subgroup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sd: The standard deviation within each subgroup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sigma_s: The pooled within-subgroup standard deviation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;se: The standard error for each subgroup mean&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;16.3.1 Total Statistics (Between Groups)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s calculate the overall process statistics that summarize the behavior across all subgroups:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;stat_t = pd.DataFrame({
  'xbbar': [stat_s['xbar'].mean()],
  'rbar': [stat_s['r'].mean()],
  'sdbar': [stat_s['sd'].mean()],
  'sigma_s': [(stat_s['sd']**2).mean()**0.5],
  'sigma_t': [water['temp'].std()]
})
stat_t&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;##    xbbar    rbar    sdbar   sigma_s   sigma_t
## 0  44.85  7.2625  1.93619  1.986174  1.989501&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These statistics give us:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;xbbar: The grand mean (average of all subgroup means)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;rbar: The average range across subgroups&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sdbar: The average standard deviation across subgroups&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sigma_s: The pooled within-subgroup standard deviation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sigma_t: The total process standard deviation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;16.3.2 Average and Standard Deviation Charts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Control charts are the heart of SPC. They help us monitor process stability over time and detect when the process is out of control. We’ll create charts for both the subgroup means (X-bar chart) and standard deviations (S chart).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;labels = pd.DataFrame({
  'time': [stat_s['time'].max()]*3,
  'type': ['xbbar','upper','lower'],
  'name': ['mean','+3 s','-3 s'],
  'value': [stat_s['xbar'].mean(), stat_s['upper'].iloc[0], stat_s['lower'].iloc[0]]
})

control_chart = (ggplot(stat_s, aes(x='time', y='xbar')) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=stat_s['xbar'].mean()), color='lightgrey', size=3) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin='lower', ymax='upper'), fill='steelblue', alpha=0.2) +
  geom_line(size=1) + geom_point(size=5) +
  geom_label(data=labels, mapping=aes(x='time', y='value', label='name'), ha='right') +
  labs(x='Time (Subgroups)', y='Average', subtitle='Average and Standard Deviation Chart'))

# Save the plot
control_chart.save('images/05_control_chart.png', width=8, height=6, dpi=100)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This control chart shows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Center line: The grand mean (xbbar)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Control limits: Upper and lower 3-sigma limits based on the standard error&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Individual points: Each subgroup mean plotted over time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shaded area: The control limits region&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Points outside the control limits or showing non-random patterns indicate the process may be out of control and requires investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Learning Check 1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Question&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Produce the same process overview chart for &lt;code&gt;pH&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;def ggprocess(x, y, xlab='Subgroup', ylab='Metric'):
  import pandas as pd
  from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_hline, geom_jitter, geom_boxplot, labs
  d = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y})
  g = (ggplot(d, aes(x='x', y='y', group='x')) +

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;16.4 Moving Range Charts (n=1)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we have individual measurements rather than subgroups, we use moving range charts. The moving range is the absolute difference between consecutive measurements, which helps us estimate process variation when we can’t calculate within-subgroup statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;indiv = water.iloc[[0,20,40,60,80,100,120,140]]
mr = (indiv['temp'].diff().abs().dropna())
mrbar = mr.mean()
import numpy as np
d2 = np.mean(np.abs(np.diff(np.random.normal(0,1,10000))))
sigma_s = mrbar / d2
se = sigma_s / (1**0.5)

    &lt;code&gt;istat = pd.DataFrame({'time': indiv['time'].iloc[1:], 'mr': mr, 'mrbar': mrbar, 'upper': upper, 'lower': lower})
mr_chart = (ggplot(istat, aes(x='time', y='mr')) +

    &lt;p&gt;The moving range chart shows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Center line: The average moving range (mrbar)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upper control limit: Based on the estimated process standard deviation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lower control limit: Set to 0 (moving ranges can’t be negative)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Individual points: Each moving range value&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This chart helps us monitor process variation when we have individual measurements rather than subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Cell So Minimal That It Challenges Definitions of Life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Life’s fundamental structure is the cell, and so the main things that a cell does — processing biomolecules, growing, replicating its genetic material and producing a new body — are considered hallmarks of life. But earlier this year, scientists discovered a cell so severely stripped of essential functions that it challenges biologists’ definitions of what counts as a living thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The species is a single-celled organism known only by the mysterious sequence of its genetic code. Its genome is fantastically small: Along the organism’s evolutionary journey, it seems to have gotten rid of most of it. According to the shocked researchers who published the discovery in a preprint uploaded to biorxiv.org in May, the lost genes include those central to cell metabolism, meaning it can neither process nutrients nor grow on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other cells with highly reduced genomes still encode proteins to create amino acids, break down carbohydrates for energy or synthesize vitamins. All this appears to be absent from the cell, which seems to be a parasite entirely dependent on a host or cellular community to meet its nutritional needs. Until now, these genetic pathways were considered fundamental for the survival of any cell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The organism’s “replicative core” — the genetic components needed to reproduce itself — remains, making up more than half of its genome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Metabolism is one of the key components of how we often define life,” said Takuro Nakayama, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Tsukuba in Japan who led the team. The cell’s discovery “challenges this by suggesting a cell can exist almost entirely without its own. It demonstrates that the diversity of cellular life is far greater than we knew and that organisms do not always follow our definitions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this form of life is new to science, it’s possible that organisms like it are common. A huge proportion of microbial biodiversity may be hiding in recursive interrelationships between parasitic and host microbes, said Puri López-García, a microbial ecologist at the French National Center for Scientific Research in Paris who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The diversity of archaea and bacteria that appear to belong to these supergroups of parasitic organisms is very, very large,” she said. For bacteria, it may be between 25% and 50% of the group’s total share of species, she suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery pushes the boundaries of our knowledge of just how small and simple cellular life can become, as it evolves even into forms that are barely alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An Extraordinary Discovery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nakayama has built a scientific career out of looking more closely than other researchers typically do. He considers an already tiny cell and wonders: Are there even smaller cells that make a home there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The difference [in size between parasitic and host cells] can sometimes be like that between a human and Godzilla,” Nakayama said. He is fascinated by the potentially vast amount of undiscovered biodiversity these relationships might contain, and his lab looks for such relationships in seawater. The ocean is a nutrient-poor environment that incentivizes cells to form trading partnerships. Sometimes they float along together, loosely tethered, exchanging rare nutrients and energy. Other times their arrangements are more organized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Citharistes regius is a globally widespread single-celled dinoflagellate that has a walled, pouchlike external chamber for housing symbiotic cyanobacteria. Nakayama and his team searched for the alga by scooping seawater samples from the Pacific Ocean using a fine-mesh net. A common technique is to sequence whatever DNA can be found in the soup of such a sample, an approach called metagenomics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That method is incredibly powerful for capturing a broad overview,” Nakayama said. “However, with such data, it is often difficult to maintain the link between a sequence and the specific cell it came from, and rare organisms can be easily missed.” His team’s more targeted approach involves microscopically identifying and physically isolating a single target cell from that mixed sample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back on shore in the Tsukuba lab, after the researchers confirmed they had C. regius, they sequenced every genome associated with that one cell. As expected, they found DNA from its symbiotic cyanobacteria, but they found something else, too: sequences that belong to an archaeon, a member of the domain of life thought to have given rise to eukaryotes like us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first, Nakayama and his colleagues thought they had made a mistake. The archaeal genome is tiny: just 238,000 base pairs end to end. In comparison, humans have a few billion base pairs, and even E. coli bacteria work with several million. (C. regius’ symbiotic cyanobacteria have 1.9 million base pairs.) Previously, the smallest known archaeal genome was the one belonging to Nanoarchaeum equitans — at 490,000 base pairs, it is more than twice as long as the new one the researchers found. They initially figured that this tiny genome — too large to be merely statistical noise — was an abbreviated piece of a much larger genome, erroneously compiled by their software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At first, we suspected it might be an artifact of the genome-assembly process,” Nakayama recalled. To check, the team sequenced the genome using different technologies and ran the data through multiple computer programs that assemble fragments of DNA sequences into a full genome. The various approaches all reconstructed the exact same 238,000-base-pair circular genome. “This consistency is what convinced us it was the real, complete genome,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This meant that Nakayama and his team had a new organism on their hands. They named the microbe Candidatus Sukunaarchaeum mirabile (hereafter referred to as Sukunaarchaeum) for its remarkably tiny genome — after Sukuna-biko-na, a Shinto deity notable for his short stature, plus a Latin word for “extraordinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Spectrum of Quasi-Life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the team consulted databases of known genes to analyze the archaeon, they found its small size was the result of a whole lot that was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sukunaarchaeum encodes the barest minimum of proteins for its own replication, and that’s about all. Most strangely, its genome is missing any hints of the genes required to process and build molecules, outside of those needed to reproduce. Lacking those metabolic components, the organism must outsource the processes for growth and maintenance to another cell, a host upon which the microbe is entirely dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other symbiotic microbes have scrapped much of their genomes, including Sukunaarchaeum’s evolutionary relatives. The researchers’ analysis suggested that the microbe is part of the DPANN archaea, sometimes called nanoarchaea or ultra-small archaea, which are characterized by small size and small genomes. DPANN archaea are generally thought to be symbiotes that cling to the outside of larger prokaryotic microbes, and plenty of them have substantially reduced genomes to match that lifestyle. But until now, none of the DPANN species had genomes quite this pared back. And Sukunaarchaeum branched off the DPANN lineage early, suggesting that it had taken its own evolutionary journey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This realm of the archaea is pretty mysterious in general,” said Brett Baker, a microbial ecologist at the University of Texas, Austin who was not involved in the work. “[DPANN archaea are] obviously limited in their metabolic capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Sukunaarchaeum may provide some undetermined benefit for its host — which could be C. regius, the symbiotic cyanobacteria or another cell entirely — it’s probably a self-absorbed parasite. “Its genome reduction is driven by entirely selfish motives, consistent with a parasitic lifestyle,” said Tim Williams, a microbiologist at the University of Technology Sydney who was not involved in the study. It cannot contribute metabolic products, so the relationship between Sukunaarchaeum and any other cell would likely be a one-way street.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other microbes have evolved similarly extreme, streamlined forms. For instance, the bacterium Carsonella ruddii, which lives as a symbiont within the guts of sap-feeding insects, has an even smaller genome than Sukunaarchaeum, at around 159,000 base pairs. However, these and other super-small bacteria have metabolic genes to produce nutrients, such as amino acids and vitamins, for their hosts. Instead, their genome has cast off much of their ability to reproduce on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They are on the way to becoming organelles. This is the way mitochondria and chloroplasts are thought to have evolved,” Williams said. “But Sukunaarchaeum has gone in the opposite direction: The genome retains genes required for its own propagation, but lost most, if not all, of its metabolic genes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon after Nakayama’s team posted their results online, they got a big response. “When we saw the preprint, this was really quite exciting in the lab,” said Thijs Ettema, an evolutionary microbiologist and expert on archaeal genomics at Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the work. “These types of organisms [with reduced genomes] have been found before, but not as extreme as this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some news reports went so far as to imply that Sukunaarchaeum is on its way to evolving into a virus. However, while both Sukunaarchaeum and viruses are reliant on a host cell for very basic biological functions, viruses can’t reproduce on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There is a fundamental gap between Sukunaarchaeum and viruses,” Nakayama said. “Sukunaarchaeum retains its own core machinery for gene expression, including ribosomes, albeit in a simplified form. This is in stark contrast to viruses, which lack ribosomes and must hijack the host’s cellular systems to replicate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings fit into a larger discussion about how we define life, Ettema said, since nature routinely evolves exceptions that defy simple categorization. “Most likely it cannot live independently,” he said. “You could say the same of bacterial symbionts. And what do we call organelles like mitochondria and plastids? … At what point should we call things alive?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Minimalist Lifestyle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many questions about Sukunaarchaeum remain unresolved. For one, a large portion of its genome is made up of genes that don’t match any known sequences. They seem to encode large proteins, which is uncommon in such radically reduced organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nakayama and his colleagues think these large proteins are employed on the cell membrane and somehow support interactions between the archaeon and its host. That would fit with the lifestyles of other studied DPANN archaea as well, Ettema said, which are generally thought to be ectosymbionts, adhering to the outside of comparatively immense hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Sukunaarchaeum was found in association with the dinoflagellate C. regius, its true host’s identity is unknown. C. regius is a eukaryote, but DPANN archaea generally associate with other archaea. Also up for debate: Is it attaching to the outside of a host cell, like other DPANN archaea, or is it living internally — or both? Answering these questions would require setting human eyes on the archaeon for the first time; at this point it’s only known from a curious string of genetic data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a slim possibility that these genes are the “lost” metabolic genes after all, López-García said, if they have evolved so far from their original sequences as to be unrecognizable. “Because the genome is so fast-evolving, maybe some of these functions correspond to metabolic functions, but the divergence is so much that we cannot identify the [gene] homologue [in the database],” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even stranger minimalist lifestyles or more reduced genomes may be out there, but researchers may miss them, Ettema said. Traditional analytical approaches for surveying the genomes of microbial samples could flag their tiny genomes as incomplete or low quality and discard them, or skip them entirely, he said. “[The DNA] might have been present in the samples, but it was removed after sequencing, and hence overlooked.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Nakayama and his colleagues searched a database of marine environmental sequence data from the world’s oceans to see if the new microbe popped up anywhere else, they didn’t find any matches. But they did detect many very similar sequences from what are likely to be close relatives. Sukunaarchaeum may be the tip of a very large microbial iceberg, one floating in a vast ocean of microbial diversity: tiny microbes clinging to slightly less tiny microbes, perhaps inside other microbes, the stories of their ancient relationships only beginning to be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qiskit is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and primitives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This library is the core component of Qiskit, which contains the building blocks for creating and working with quantum circuits, quantum operators, and primitive functions (Sampler and Estimator). It also contains a transpiler that supports optimizing quantum circuits, and a quantum information toolbox for creating advanced operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more details on how to use Qiskit, refer to the documentation located here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We encourage installing Qiskit via &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install qiskit&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pip will handle all dependencies automatically and you will always install the latest (and well-tested) version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install from source, follow the instructions in the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that Qiskit is installed, it's time to begin working with Qiskit. The essential parts of a quantum program are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Define and build a quantum circuit that represents the quantum state&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Define the classical output by measurements or a set of observable operators&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Depending on the output, use the Sampler primitive to sample outcomes or the Estimator primitive to estimate expectation values.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create an example quantum circuit using the &lt;code&gt;QuantumCircuit&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

# 1. A quantum circuit for preparing the quantum state |000&amp;gt; + i |111&amp;gt; / √2
qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
qc.h(0)             # generate superposition
qc.p(np.pi / 2, 0)  # add quantum phase
qc.cx(0, 1)         # 0th-qubit-Controlled-NOT gate on 1st qubit
qc.cx(0, 2)         # 0th-qubit-Controlled-NOT gate on 2nd qubit&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This simple example creates an entangled state known as a GHZ state &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;), Phase gate (&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;), and CNOT gate (&lt;code&gt;cx&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you've made your first quantum circuit, choose which primitive you will use. Starting with the Sampler, we use &lt;code&gt;measure_all(inplace=False)&lt;/code&gt; to get a copy of the circuit in which all the qubits are measured:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 2. Add the classical output in the form of measurement of all qubits
qc_measured = qc.measure_all(inplace=False)

# 3. Execute using the Sampler primitive
from qiskit.primitives import StatevectorSampler
sampler = StatevectorSampler()
job = sampler.run([qc_measured], shots=1000)
result = job.result()
print(f" &amp;gt; Counts: {result[0].data['meas'].get_counts()}")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running this will give an outcome similar to &lt;code&gt;{'000': 497, '111': 503}&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code&gt;000&lt;/code&gt; 50% of the time and &lt;code&gt;111&lt;/code&gt; 50% of the time up to statistical fluctuations.
To illustrate the power of the Estimator, we now use the quantum information toolbox to create the operator &lt;code&gt;run()&lt;/code&gt; function, along with our quantum circuit. Note that the Estimator requires a circuit without measurements, so we use the &lt;code&gt;qc&lt;/code&gt; circuit we created earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 2. Define the observable to be measured 
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
operator = SparsePauliOp.from_list([("XXY", 1), ("XYX", 1), ("YXX", 1), ("YYY", -1)])

# 3. Execute using the Estimator primitive
from qiskit.primitives import StatevectorEstimator
estimator = StatevectorEstimator()
job = estimator.run([(qc, operator)], precision=1e-3)
result = job.result()
print(f" &amp;gt; Expectation values: {result[0].data.evs}")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running this will give the outcome &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;. For fun, try to assign a value of +/- 1 to each single-qubit operator X and Y
and see if you can achieve this outcome. (Spoiler alert: this is not possible!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the Qiskit-provided &lt;code&gt;qiskit.primitives.StatevectorSampler&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;qiskit.primitives.StatevectorEstimator&lt;/code&gt; will not take you very far.
The power of quantum computing cannot be simulated on classical computers and you need to use real quantum hardware to scale to larger quantum circuits.
However, running a quantum circuit on hardware requires rewriting to the basis gates and connectivity of the quantum hardware.
The tool that does this is the transpiler, and Qiskit includes transpiler passes for synthesis, optimization, mapping, and scheduling.
However, it also includes a default compiler, which works very well in most examples.
The following code will map the example circuit to the &lt;code&gt;basis_gates = ["cz", "sx", "rz"]&lt;/code&gt; and a
bidirectional linear chain of qubits &lt;code&gt;coupling_map = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from qiskit import transpile
from qiskit.transpiler import Target, CouplingMap
target = Target.from_configuration(
    basis_gates=["cz", "sx", "rz"],
    coupling_map=CouplingMap.from_line(3),
)
qc_transpiled = transpile(qc, target=target)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qiskit provides an abstraction layer that lets users run quantum circuits on hardware from any vendor that provides a compatible interface. The best way to use Qiskit is with a runtime environment that provides optimized implementations of Sampler and Estimator for a given hardware platform. This runtime may involve using pre- and post-processing, such as optimized transpiler passes with error suppression, error mitigation, and, eventually, error correction built in. A runtime implements &lt;code&gt;qiskit.primitives.BaseSamplerV2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimatorV2&lt;/code&gt; interfaces. For example,
some packages that provide implementations of a runtime primitive implementation are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qiskit also provides a lower-level abstract interface for describing quantum backends. This interface, located in &lt;code&gt;qiskit.providers&lt;/code&gt;, defines an abstract &lt;code&gt;BackendV2&lt;/code&gt; class that providers can implement to represent their
hardware or simulators to Qiskit. The backend class includes a common interface for executing circuits on the backends; however, in this interface each provider may perform different types of pre- and post-processing and return outcomes that are vendor-defined. Some examples of published provider packages that interface with real hardware are:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After nearly 50 years in space, NASA’s Voyager 1 is about to hit a historic milestone. By November 15, 2026, it will be 16.1 billion miles (25.9 billion km) away, meaning a radio signal will take a full 24 hours—a full light-day—to reach it. For context, a light-year is the distance light travels in a year, about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion km), so one light-day is just a tiny fraction of that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launched in 1977 to explore Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012, becoming the most distant human-made object ever. Traveling at around 11 miles per second (17.7 km/s), it adds roughly 3.5 astronomical units (the distance from Earth to the Sun) each year. Even after decades in the harsh environment of space, Voyager 1 keeps sending data thanks to its radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which will last into the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicating with Voyager 1 is slow. Commands now take about a day to arrive, with another day for confirmation. Compare that to the Moon (1.3 seconds), Mars (up to 4 minutes), and Pluto (nearly 7 hours). The probe’s distance makes every instruction a patient exercise in deep-space operations. To reach our closest star, Proxima Centauri, even at light speed, would take over four years—showing just how tiny a light-day is in cosmic terms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voyager 1’s journey is more than a record for distance. From its planetary flybys to the iconic ‘Pale Blue Dot’ image, it reminds us of the vast scale of the solar system and the incredible endurance of a spacecraft designed to keep exploring, even without return.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cloudflare outage should not have happened, and they seem to be missing the point on how to avoid it in the future by Eduardo Bellani&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet again, another global IT outage happen (deja vu strikes again in our industry). This time at cloudflare(Prince 2025). Again, taking down large swats of the internet with it(Booth 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yes, like my previous analysis of the GCP and CrowdStrike’s outages, this post critiques Cloudflare’s root cause analysis (RCA), which — despite providing a great overview of what happened — misses the real lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the key section of their RCA:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there were assumptions made in the past, that the list of columns returned by a query like this would only include the “default” database:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SELECT name, type FROM system.columns WHERE table = ‘http_requests_features’ order by name;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note how the query does not filter for the database name. With us gradually rolling out the explicit grants to users of a given ClickHouse cluster, after the change at 11:05 the query above started returning “duplicates” of columns because those were for underlying tables stored in the r0 database.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This, unfortunately, was the type of query that was performed by the Bot Management feature file generation logic to construct each input “feature” for the file mentioned at the beginning of this section.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The query above would return a table of columns like the one displayed (simplified example):&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, as part of the additional permissions that were granted to the user, the response now contained all the metadata of the r0 schema effectively more than doubling the rows in the response ultimately affecting the number of rows (i.e. features) in the final file output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A central database query didn’t have the right constraints to express business rules. Not only it missed the database name, but it clearly needs a distinct and a limit, since these seem to be crucial business rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, a new underlying security work manifested the (unintended) potential already there in the query. Since this was by definition unintended, the application code didn’t expect that value to be what it was, and reacted poorly. This caused a crash loop across seemingly all of cloudflare’s core systems. This bug wasn’t caught during rollout because the faulty code path required data that was assumed to be impossible to be generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds familiar? It should. Any senior engineer has seen this pattern before. This is classic database/application mismatch. With this in mind, let’s review how Cloudflare is planning to prevent this from happening again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hardening ingestion of Cloudflare-generated configuration files in the same way we would for user-generated input&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enabling more global kill switches for features&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eliminating the ability for core dumps or other error reports to overwhelm system resources&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reviewing failure modes for error conditions across all core proxy modules&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are all solid, reasonable steps. But here’s the problem: they already do most of this—and the outage happened anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because of they seem to mistake physical replication with not having a single point of failure. This mistakes the physical layer with the logical layer. One can have a logical single point of failure without having any physical one, which was the case in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I base my paragraph on their choice of abandoning PostgreSQL and adopting ClickHouse(Bocharov 2018). The whole post is a great overview on trying to process data fast, without a single line on how to garantee its logical correctness/consistency in the face of changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are treating a logical problem as if it was a physical problem&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll repeat the same advice I offered in my previous article on GCP’s outage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The real cause&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These kinds of outages stem from the uncontrolled interaction between application logic and database schema. You can’t reliably catch that with more tests or rollouts or flags. You prevent it by construction—through analytical design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No nullable fiels.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;(as a cororally of 1) full normalization of the database (The principles of database design, or, the Truth is out there)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;formally verified application code(Chapman et al. 2024)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FAANG-style companies are unlikely to adopt formal methods or relational rigor wholesale. But for their most critical systems, they should. It’s the only way to make failures like this impossible by design, rather than just less likely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The internet would thank them. (Cloud users too—caveat emptor.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RAM prices have skyrocketed globally in 2025, with industry officials pointing to explosive demand from AI data centers as the primary cause. Mainstream DDR5 memory modules now cost at least twice what they did in mid-2025, and overall DRAM contract prices were a stunning 171.8% higher in the third quarter of 2025 compared to a year prior. For context, these increases have even outpaced the surge in gold prices over the same period, which has also seen a surge in price given economic fears and overall uncertainty. Manufacturers and analysts are now warning us that we're at the start of a major DRAM bull market, with shortages expected to continue into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all of that said, the memory industry has a bit of history with regard to price-fixing. While I'm sure that there are perfectly natural market forces at play, here, there's a lot of room for skepticism, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A global surge in memory pricing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Some context, first&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The price spike in memory (especially DRAM) is being felt worldwide. Contract prices for server and PC memory have climbed steeply through 2025, and these increases are now trickling down to retail. For example, a standard 32GB Corsair RAM kit I found on Amazon, specifically 6000 MHz DDR5, cost $110 at the start of this year. Now it costs a whopping $442 after a long period of time where it was out of stock. That quadrupling in price in less than a year highlights just how quickly the market has turned. In other regions, prices have jumped at a similar scale, and there have been reports of retailers even rationing sales of memory modules due to limited supply. In Japan, certain shops have even capped the quantity of HDDs, SSDs, and RAM that a customer can buy because deliveries are so scarce, and memory kit launches are being delayed, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't just a DRAM story, either. NAND flash memory and hard drive prices are rising in tandem, all caught in the same squeeze of demand that's affecting everything. Back in September, both DRAM and NAND flash contract prices were climbing by 15 to 20%, and that trend has accelerated as we enter the final quarter of the year. Major cloud providers have reportedly agreed to pay up to 50% higher prices for memory chips than they did in the previous quarter. Plus, even despite those premiums, some companies report only receiving approximately 70% of the server memory that they ordered, and smaller buyers are receiving even less. Memory is being allocated to those with deeper pockets first, and it's affecting everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone looking to upgrade or build a PC will have noticed the crazy-high RAM prices that are now taking hold. The cost savings from cheaper CPUs or GPUs this year are being wiped out by memory kit price hikes. Even now, desktop DDR5 memory modules cost roughly double what they did just a few months ago, and this adds significant expense to any build. And if you thought you could go to older DDR4 modules instead, then think again. Those are also getting pricier as they become scarcer, and that's because DDR4 is being phased out of production. Companies like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are extending how long they're producing it for, but production was supposed to have stopped by now, and it's unlikely that they're producing it at the same rate they used to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not just consumers and AI companies that are feeling the pressure; companies that produce devices like laptops, smartphones, and graphics cards are feeling the squeeze, too. Major PC OEMs and system integrators have started panic-buying and stockpiling RAM to secure supply, and Asus has said that it only has about two months of inventory left for production. Embedded devices aren't exempt either, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which had stockpiled memory ahead of time, was forced to increase the prices of its 4GB and 8GB models by $5 and $10, respectively, because memory now costs "roughly 120% more than it did a year ago," according to Raspberry Pi Holdings CEO Eben Upton.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even data centers aren't safe from the chaos they've created, and some analysts estimate the world's largest memory maker, Samsung, have imposed such steep price hikes that they could push AI server costs up by 10% to 25% for cloud operators. If things worsen to the point of not being able to get any stock at all, hyperscalers may have to slow down their AI data center deployments because they simply can't get enough memory to actually build out their data centers. Plus, because AI servers are devouring both DRAM and storage, it's causing a cascading effect. High-capacity HDDs (which are used for data center storage) are on backorder for a year or more, and with disk drives scarce, cloud companies are turning to flash storage (SSDs) in roles traditionally filled by disks. This simultaneous strain on NAND flash and HDDs is unprecedented, as when one was constrained, the other often acted as a fallback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI is the official explanation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;An absurd amount of DRAM is going to just a few companies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The explanation from industry leaders is centered around a perfect storm of both booming demand and constrained supply, and the narrative from most companies in the space backs that assertion up. Generative AI requires a huge amount of both memory and storage, as training and running models require data centers filled with GPUs; GPUs that can have hundreds of gigabytes of DRAM paired with multiple terabytes of flash storage. For example, OpenAI's new "Stargate" project reportedly signed deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for up to 900,000 wafers of DRAM per month to feed its AI clusters, which is an amount close to 40% of total global DRAM output if it's ever met. That's an absurd amount of DRAM. Similarly, cloud providers are pre-buying years' worth of memory. Micron, as another example, has already presold essentially all of its HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) chip output essentially through 2026, and Samsung's next-gen V9 NAND flash is nearly fully booked by enterprise customers before launch, though that's a problem that technically started in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the supply side, only a few companies produce the vast majority of the world's memory chips, and they were clearly not prepared for this surge. The DRAM industry is an oligopoly of basically three major players; Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron. Over the past decades, the memory market's brutal boom and bust cycles drove many competitors out, leaving just these few big suppliers. This matters because with so few producers, any strategic choices they make (or don't make) have outsized impact on supply. In this cycle, manufacturers had cut back production and investment during the last downturn (2022), and they've been slow to ramp back up. To make matters worse, with a suspected AI bubble that could pop at any moment, it seems that memory makers have no plans to significantly increase overall DRAM production as a result of potential market volatility. In an interview with Taiwanese CommonWealth Magazine, Pua Khein-Seng, CEO of Phison, said the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;NAND will face severe shortages next year. I think supply will be tight for the next ten years. In the past, every time flash makers invested more, prices collapsed, and they never recouped their investments. So companies slowed spending starting around 2019–2020. Then in 2023, Micron and SK Hynix redirected huge CapEx into HBM because the margins were so attractive, leaving even less investment for flash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another factor limiting supply of standard RAM is that memory firms are diverting their limited manufacturing capacity to the most lucrative products. Specifically, there's a gold rush for HBM, which is a special kind of memory used by AI accelerator GPUs, because HBM commands far higher prices and profit margins than commodity DRAM. Every wafer a company allocates to making HBM for GPUs is one not used to make standard PC or server DRAM, so from the point of view of a major company, why bother investing in the consumer-grade or regular data-center hardware when the same resources can be used to make something with a much higher return? These companies ran out of HBM last year, and if production was shifted towards HBM, then they can gain a higher return on each wafer while also increasing the price of regular DRAM, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to DDR4, given those phase-out timelines given by the major producers, some smaller Chinese companies (like CXMT and Jinhua) are stepping in to make DDR4 and undercut prices, but they haven't fully filled the void. This story may sound familiar; when DDR3 was phased out, the big players exited in the same way. Essentially, the industry says that this is all a supply-and-demand imbalance, with demand from AI and cloud shooting up and supply being unable (and unwilling) to catch up. Many will argue that there's nothing nefarious going on, and it's all caused by unfortunate timing and caution from the companies that produce global DRAM supplies. If AI proves to be a bubble that bursts, memory firms will end up with another price crash like what has happened in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DRAM producers have artificially inflated prices before&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;And all of them are benefiting right now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, there are a lot of plausible factors that we've already highlighted that could cause pressure on pricing, but there's a lot of room for skepticism, too. I'm not saying that all of these reasons given aren't the cause for the recent price boom, but what I am saying is that it wouldn't be the first time that price-fixing occurred in the memory industry. The DRAM market, being dominated by three main players, has crossed the line into illegal, price-fixing cartels. In the early 2000s, multiple memory manufacturers pleaded guilty to conspiring to fix DRAM prices between 1998 and 2002, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in fines given out to a few manufacturers, including the big three that survive to this day: SK Hynix, Samsung, and Micron. More recently, during the big DRAM price run-up in the middle of 2016 and the start of 2018 (where prices nearly tripled in a year and a half), a class-action lawsuit accused the big three of colluding to restrict supply in order to inflate prices. That more recent class action lawsuit was brought by the same firm that brought the original class action suit in the early 2000s against those same companies, which coincided with the U.S. Department of Justice investigation. While that second lawsuit didn't hold up in court (and failed in appeal), that ongoing suspicion exists for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this history shows one thing: memory suppliers have both the motive and precedent to coordinate behavior, even tacitly, in order to keep prices high. When only a handful of firms control the taps, it doesn't take a formal cartel for them to collectively benefit from constrained supply. Each firm knows that flooding the market would hurt all of their profits, so a form of unspoken coordination can occur, and this is next to impossible to prove. The backdrop of past cartels makes it hard not to be cynical when hearing that "AI demand" is solely to blame for increased prices. Whether or not any collusion is happening now, it's clear that memory companies are profiting immensely from the current crisis. After bleeding financially during the last oversupply downturn, the major DRAM makers are now seeing record-high earnings in the third quarter of 2025 thanks to the price surge, and to put it bluntly, the shortage is great for business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, these same companies are not rushing to add capacity that would ease prices, a fact justified by fear of an AI bubble, but which also conveniently prolongs their windfall. Memory suppliers have shifted to higher-profit chips (like HBM) and aren't exactly trying to temper the increases in demand. Instead, they're facilitating it at higher prices. It's worth noting that the big three DRAM makers have all taken a similarly cautious (and profit-preserving) approach this DRAM cycle. All have cut back on older products (like DDR4), all are prioritizing higher-margin AI-related memory, and none are dramatically boosting standard DRAM output or engaging in a price war to gain market share. In effect, supply is being "redirected" in unison. All three firms seem to be stockpiling capital rather than building new fabs immediately, despite the obvious need. Micron, for example, has plans for new fabrication plants (one in New York, one expansion in Idaho), but it has delayed some of those projects by years, all while reportedly pushing out its new U.S. DRAM megafab by two to three years due to market uncertainty, even as it accelerates niche projects like an HBM fab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's hard not to see this supposedly coincidental aligned strategy of restraint and wonder if there's something more at play. All of these actions support pricing stability (for those companies) and suggests that no one is "breaking ranks" to grab a larger share by undercutting prices. In a truly competitive scenario, at least one player might be tempted to boost production and capture the extraordinary demand, even if it meant driving prices down, in order to grow their market share and revenue. We haven't seen that; instead we see a cautious, unified approach across the three major players. Three major players that have, in the past, been accused of price-fixing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd argue that it’s not conspiracy theory territory to be skeptical of the official reasoning. To be clear, AI demand is real and is a major factor, and we've seen the impact it's had on all kinds of markets. The numbers don't lie about huge new consumption of memory, but it's easy to be suspicious given that the memory industry's structure just so happens to benefit the three companies that control practically all of it when supply is constrained in this way. One could make the case that companies will have an attitude along the lines of "Never let a good crisis go to waste," while memory vendors would counter that they are merely being cautious and that they'll invest in new capacity once they're sure this demand isn't merely a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Things don't look to be getting better&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It'll be more than a year at least&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This current trend is complex, and on the surface, it's being driven by something that is genuinely transformative to the wider industry as a whole. The rise of AI and data centers that consume far more memory and storage than traditional computing ever did is certainly a factor, and that real demand surge, combined with the slow ramp of supply, is definitely a large portion of the price increases and shortages we're seeing. However, with so few companies controlling the market, alongside their decisions to prioritize profits, cut back older products, and cautiously avoid overproduction, have all lent credence to allegations that something bigger may be at play. After all, history shows that these firms have skirted the line between smart business and anti-consumer collusion before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, both things can be true. The AI revolution can be driving unprecedented demand for memory, while the memory giants are more than happy to not fully ease the supply pressure because it's basically printing money for them. Unfortunately, everyone else is caught in the middle, and it's not just consumers feeling the pressure, either. AMD is reportedly thinking about increasing the price of its GPUs as a result, and when companies exhaust their memory supplies for laptops and other hardware, those costs will likely rise as well. It's hard to justify building a PC right now, especially because it's unclear when all of this uncertainty will end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's the question most people are wondering the answer to: when will it end? Unfortunately, it looks likely to extend well into 2026, and as we already noted, the CEO of Phison thinks it could be a decade. The only way things will improve is if either the supposed AI bubble pops and the demand cools off, or more manufacturing capabilities come online. If companies started to purchase less DRAM as a result of memory prices rising so high that they start delaying purchases, that could well be a good sign that the tides will turn, but for now, it's clear that cheap, plentiful RAM is no more. Right now, whether initial skepticism turns out to be right or wrong, one thing is true: the house is winning, and everyone else is paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Scaleway’s mission is clear: to provide iOS and macOS developers, macOS software users, and businesses of all sizes with remote access to the power of Apple silicon (M-series) chips — all within a controlled, secure, and high-performance environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each Mac mini is managed automatically. Once installed in the racks, Scaleway’s teams add a custom Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile to deploy system settings remotely, along with a set of server-specific tools that compensate for the lack of a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC). This enables granular management of each machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to this process, we at Scaleway can deliver a consumer-grade Mac mini as a fully reliable dedicated server, seamlessly integrated into our cloud ecosystem — ready to meet even the most demanding production needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All Scaleway Mac minis are hosted exclusively in French datacenters, ensuring sovereign hosting that meets the highest standards for security, privacy, and data locality in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the heart of this infrastructure lies Opcore DC2, Scaleway’s strategic datacenter located in Vitry-sur-Seine, where hundreds of Mac minis run side by side with traditional bare-metal servers — all within a resilient, high-performance network architecture monitored in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scaleway’s datacenter design reflects its commitment to performance and reliability:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mac mini wasn’t originally designed for datacenter environments: there’s no BMC (Baseboard Management Controller), no native remote firmware access, and no standard rackmount format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To overcome this, Scaleway engineered a custom chassis where each Mac mini is placed in an individual sliding tray. This allows any unit to be removed for maintenance without disrupting the others — ensuring maximum density and ease of access. Ethernet cabling is carefully organized to guarantee fast, stable network connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each rack can hold up to 96 Mac minis, an impressive density compared to traditional servers. This is made possible by two key factors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, Scaleway’s Mac mini racks are among the most energy-efficient server setups in the cloud industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the absence of a BMC posed a major challenge: how to perform critical remote operations without physical access?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scaleway’s solution to that problem was ingenious: embedding a Raspberry Pi module with each Mac mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each Raspberry Pi acts as a control layer, sending commands such as reboot or remote reinstall to the Mac mini. This makes the machines virtually autonomous throughout their cloud lifecycle, while remaining fully compliant with Apple’s hardware requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scaleway plans to keep expanding its Mac mini fleet as cloud-native development evolves. Future versions of macOS, the rise of AI workloads, and the growing need for macOS environments in cross-platform development are all driving demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Mac mini as-a-Service, Scaleway delivers a powerful, flexible solution designed for developers, tech companies, and demanding freelancers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access the power of a Mac as if it were on your desk — without the hardware constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
