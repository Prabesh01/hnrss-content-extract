  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Linux Boot Process: From Power Button to Kernel&lt;/head&gt;- 15 mins&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1 — From power button to the kernel’s first breath&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You press the power button. A second later a wall of text scrolls by, or a logo fades in, and eventually Linux appears. What happens in between is not magic. It is a careful handshake between tiny programs and a very literal CPU. This part follows that handshake until the very first line of C code inside the Linux kernel runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The very first instruction&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When power stabilizes, the CPU resets itself to a tiny, old‑fashioned mode called real mode. Real mode dates back to the original 8086 chip. The rules are simple on purpose. Memory addresses are built from two values the CPU keeps in special fast storage called registers. You combine a segment and an offset like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;physical_address = (segment &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4) + offset&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see numbers like &lt;code&gt;0xFFFFFFF0&lt;/code&gt;, that is hexadecimal. Hex is base 16. We write &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; in front to make that clear. &lt;code&gt;0x10&lt;/code&gt; is 16 in everyday counting. &lt;code&gt;0x100000&lt;/code&gt; is 1 megabyte. Hex lines up nicely with how hardware stores bits, which is why you see it everywhere in low‑level code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right after reset the CPU jumps to a special address called the reset vector at &lt;code&gt;0xFFFFFFF0&lt;/code&gt;. Think of it as a permanent bookmark that says “start here.” There is room for almost nothing at that address, so manufacturers put a short jump there that passes control to the firmware on your motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: register A register is a tiny slot inside the CPU. It holds a number the CPU is using right now. Names like CS and IP are register names. CS means “code segment,” which marks the current neighborhood for instructions. IP means “instruction pointer,” which marks which instruction comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;BIOS and UEFI&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firmware is a small starter program baked into your board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System. It is the older style. BIOS does a quick health check called POST, looks at the boot order, and tries each device. If it finds a disk whose very first 512‑byte sector ends with the marker bytes &lt;code&gt;0x55&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0xAA&lt;/code&gt;, it treats that device as bootable. BIOS copies that sector to memory at &lt;code&gt;0x7C00&lt;/code&gt; and jumps there. That sector is tiny, so it usually knows only how to load the next, larger piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UEFI is the modern replacement. It still starts the machine, but it understands filesystems directly and can load bigger boot programs without the old “first sector” dance. UEFI also passes richer information to the operating system. Different path, same goal: hand control to a boot program that can load Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Meet the bootloader&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bootloader is the usher that gets the operating system into place. GRUB is a popular choice on PCs. It reads its configuration, shows a menu if you installed one, and loads the Linux kernel into memory. The Linux kernel file actually contains two things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;a small setup program that still runs in real mode&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;the larger compressed kernel that will be unpacked a little later&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;GRUB also fills out a small structure called the setup header with useful facts: where it placed the kernel, where the command line lives, where the initrd is if you have one. Then it jumps into the setup program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The setup program makes a safe room&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Linux can do anything interesting, the setup code creates a predictable workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lines up the segment registers so memory copies behave the same way every time. Names you’ll see here are CS for code, DS for data, and SS for stack. It also clears a single CPU bit called the “direction flag” so copy instructions move forward through memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It creates a stack. The stack is a last‑in, first‑out workbench where functions store temporary values. SS says which segment the stack uses. SP is the pointer to the current top of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It clears a region called BSS. BSS is where global variables that must start as zero live. C code assumes BSS is zero. The setup program writes zeros over that entire span to keep that promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you passed &lt;code&gt;earlyprintk&lt;/code&gt; on the kernel command line, the setup code also programs the serial port so it can print very early messages. This is useful when graphics are not ready yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally the setup program asks the firmware “how much usable RAM do we really have and where are the holes.” On old BIOS this is a call people often nickname e820, which returns a simple list of usable and reserved ranges. The kernel will use that list to avoid stepping on the firmware’s toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that done, the setup code calls its first C function, which is literally named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;. We are still in the small old real mode at this point. The next job is to leave it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: interrupt An interrupt is a hardware or software “excuse me” that pauses what the CPU is doing and runs a small handler for something urgent. A timer tick is an interrupt. A key press is an interrupt. There are two flavors here. Maskable interrupts follow your rules and can be temporarily blocked so they do not fire during delicate moments. Non‑maskable interrupts, often called NMI, always cut in because they usually report serious hardware issues. We will control both while switching modes so nothing surprises us halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 2 — Leaving real mode, stepping through 32‑bit land, and arriving in 64‑bit&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern Linux on PCs runs in long mode, which is the 64‑bit mode of x86_64. You cannot jump there directly from real mode. The path is real mode to protected mode and then protected mode to long mode. This part covers that path and explains the vocabulary on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Protected mode, without the jargon haze&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protected mode is the 32‑bit world introduced to get past the limits of the 1980s. It adds two central ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Descriptor Table, or GDT, is a short list of segment descriptions. A description says “this segment starts here, covers this much, and is allowed to do these things.” Linux keeps this simple. It uses a flat model, which means the base is zero and the size covers the whole 32‑bit space. When everything is flat, addresses look like plain numbers again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Interrupt Descriptor Table, or IDT, is a directory of “phone numbers” for emergency calls. If an interrupt arrives, the CPU looks up the entry in the IDT and jumps to the handler listed there. During the switch we load a tiny placeholder IDT because we are about to block interrupts anyway. The full‑featured IDT arrives later once the real kernel is in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The careful switch&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setup code turns off the noisy parts first. It disables maskable interrupts with a single instruction. It quiets the old PIC chips so hardware interrupts are fully blocked for a moment. It opens the A20 line. This is a historical quirk. Early PCs made addresses wrap at 1 megabyte. Opening A20 removes that wrap so higher addresses work like you expect. It resets the math coprocessor so the floating point state is clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it loads a tiny GDT with only what we need right now and a tiny IDT. Finally it sets a single bit named PE in a control register named CR0 and performs a far jump. That jump reloads the code segment from the GDT and locks in protected mode. It reloads the data and stack segments and fixes the stack pointer to match the new flat world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now in 32‑bit protected mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: control registers The CPU has a few special registers for on off switches. CR0 turns on protected mode. CR3 holds the address of the top of the page tables, which we will need in a second. CR4 enables a set of extended features such as larger page table entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why we still are not done&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux wants 64‑bit. That is long mode. Two things are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paging must be on. Paging is the translator between virtual addresses and physical addresses. Programs use virtual addresses. The hardware reads and writes physical memory. Page tables map one to the other in fixed‑size chunks called pages. On PCs a normal page is 4 kilobytes. There are also bigger pages. Early in boot the kernel uses 2 megabyte pages to describe low memory quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single bit named LME in a special register called EFER must be set to allow long mode. EFER is a model specific register, which is a fancy way of saying “a register used for certain CPU features.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Building just enough paging&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 32‑bit prologue builds a small set of page tables that say “for this region, virtual equals physical.” That is called an identity map. It is enough to flip paging on safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make this work the code enables PAE in CR4 so larger entries are used. It builds a minimal set of tables that cover low memory in 2 megabyte chunks. It writes the address of the top table into CR3. Paging is now ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally it sets LME in EFER and performs a far return into a label that is written as 64‑bit code. Long mode is now active. Segments are still “flat,” but addresses and registers are 64‑bit wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why all the extra care Switching modes while a live system runs is like changing a car tire while rolling. The code blocks interruptions, prepares the minimum needed tables, flips the bit, and only then invites interrupts back. Slow and steady prevents weird half‑switched states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 3 — Unpacking the real kernel, fixing addresses, and why Linux sometimes moves itself&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a 64‑bit CPU with paging on and a compressed kernel in memory. Now the small 64‑bit stub does the practical work: get out of the way if needed, unpack the kernel, fix addresses if the kernel is not at its default spot, and jump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Clearing a path and setting safety nets&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stub first figures out where it is actually running. Early code is linked as if it lived at address zero and then computes its real base at runtime. If the planned destination for the decompressed kernel would overlap the stub, it copies itself to a safe place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It clears its own BSS so global state starts clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It loads a minimal IDT with two handlers. One for page fault and one for NMI. A page fault happens when the CPU cannot find a mapping for a virtual address it just tried to use. In our early identity‑mapped world, the tiny page fault handler can add the missing mapping on the fly and continue. The NMI handler is there so a non‑maskable interrupt does not crash the machine while we are still bringing things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also builds identity mappings for the regions it will touch next. That includes the future home of the kernel, the small boot parameters page the bootloader filled in, and the command line buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Decompressing Linux…&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A C function commonly named &lt;code&gt;extract_kernel&lt;/code&gt; takes over. It sets aside a tiny heap for temporary buffers, prints the classic line, and unpacks the kernel using whatever algorithm the kernel was built with. gzip, xz, zstd, lzo, and others all plug into the same wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the bytes are out, the decompressor reads the kernel’s ELF headers. ELF, short for Executable and Linkable Format, is both a file format and a map. It says which chunks are code, which are data, and exactly where each chunk wants to live. The decompressor copies each chunk where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the kernel is being loaded at a different address than it was built for, the decompressor applies relocations. A relocation is a small fix‑up that adjusts a pointer or an instruction that contains an address. The decompressor walks a list of these and patches each place so it points to the right spot in the address space we are actually using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When everything is in place, the decompressor returns the entry point of the real kernel and jumps there, passing a pointer to the boot parameters. From that moment you are in the full kernel. The first function you meet is &lt;code&gt;start_kernel&lt;/code&gt;, and the big initialization begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why the kernel sometimes moves itself on purpose&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may see kASLR mentioned in kernel logs. That stands for Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization. The idea is simple. If attackers do not know where the kernel lives in memory, certain attacks get a lot harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in boot, if kASLR is enabled, the decompressor chooses two “bases” at random:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;a physical base, which is where the bytes will live in RAM&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;a virtual base, the starting virtual address the kernel will use once full paging is set up&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does it choose without breaking anything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It builds a do not touch list. That includes the decompressor itself, the compressed image, the initial ramdisk, the boot parameters page, and the command line buffer. It can also include ranges you reserve with a &lt;code&gt;memmap=&lt;/code&gt; option on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It scans the memory map from firmware to find large free regions. For each free region it counts how many aligned “slots” of the right size would fit. It draws a random number using the best early entropy source it has. On modern CPUs that might be a hardware random instruction. It reduces the number to the total number of slots and picks the matching slot. That becomes the physical base. The virtual base is chosen the same way, but within the kernel’s virtual address window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nothing suitable exists, the code falls back to the default addresses and prints a small warning. If you pass &lt;code&gt;nokaslr&lt;/code&gt; on the command line, the randomization step is skipped by design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A quick glossary you can bookmark&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hexadecimal. Base 16 numbers written with &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;0x10&lt;/code&gt; is 16. &lt;code&gt;0x100000&lt;/code&gt; is 1 megabyte. Hex maps cleanly to bits, which is why low‑level code uses it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Register. A tiny slot inside the CPU that holds a number right now. Examples: CS, DS, SS, IP, SP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segment and offset. The two pieces used to build real‑mode addresses. Physical address equals segment times 16 plus offset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIOS. Older firmware that starts the machine, checks hardware, and loads the first boot sector into memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UEFI. Modern firmware that understands filesystems and loads larger boot programs directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bootloader. The usher that places the kernel in memory and passes facts about the system to it. GRUB is a common one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stack. A last‑in, first‑out workbench for functions. SS selects its segment. SP points at the current top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BSS. A region where global variables that must start as zero live. The kernel setup code clears it before C runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interrupt. A fast “excuse me” from hardware or software. The CPU pauses, runs a small handler, then resumes. Maskable interrupts can be blocked for a moment. NMI cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GDT. Global Descriptor Table. Short list of segment descriptors. Linux sets it to a simple flat model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDT. Interrupt Descriptor Table. Directory of interrupt handlers. Early boot uses a minimal one. The full kernel installs the real one later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A20 line. Historical switch that must be opened to address above 1 megabyte correctly on old PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protected mode. 32‑bit mode that introduces the GDT and IDT and allows paging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long mode. 64‑bit mode on x86_64. Requires paging and a bit named LME set in the EFER register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paging. The translator from virtual addresses to physical memory. Implemented with page tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page tables. The data structure that maps virtual pages to physical pages. Early boot uses identity maps. Normal pages are 4 KB. Early boot often uses 2 MB pages to cover ground quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CR0, CR3, CR4. Control registers. CR0 turns on protected mode. CR3 points to the top of the page tables. CR4 enables extended features such as PAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFER. A model‑specific register that holds Long Mode Enable among other bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ELF. The kernel’s on‑disk format with a built‑in map of what belongs where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relocation. A fix‑up that adjusts addresses when code is loaded at a different base than it was built for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;kASLR. Randomizes kernel base addresses at boot to make exploitation harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback is extremely welcomed! You can reach out to me on X @0xkato&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

The leak test revealed more than 0.005 mCi of removable contamination of Cs-137. The definitive cause of the leakage was not determined; however, cracks in the source were noticed through visible inspection. The leaking source was placed in a lead pig. The pig and cleanup waste were placed in a double bagged plastic bag and stored behind lead bricks. Removable contamination surveys were performed at the site of the leaking source and on the hands of the physicists. All areas and personnel were found to be free of removable contamination. The licensee will contact a company for waste disposal and will notify the department when the disposal is completed. The incident was reported to our office on October 10, 2025."&lt;lb/&gt;GA Incident Number: 109&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Pico-Banana-400K is a large-scale dataset of ~400K text–image–edit triplets designed to advance research in text-guided image editing.&lt;lb/&gt; Each example contains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;an original image (from Open Images),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a human-like edit instruction, and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the edited result generated by Nano-Banana and verified by Gemini-2.5-Pro.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dataset spans 35 edit operations across 8 semantic categories, covering diverse transformations—from low-level color adjustments to high-level object, scene, and stylistic edits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Feature&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Total Samples&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~257K single-turn text–image–edit triplets for SFT, ~56K single-turn text-image(positive) - image(negative)-edit for preference learning, and ~72K multi-turn texts-images-edits for multi-turn applications&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Automated judging pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Pro for edit quality&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pico-Banana-400K is built using a two-stage multimodal generation pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instruction Generation&lt;lb/&gt;Each Open Images sample is passed to Gemini-2.5-Flash, which writes concise, natural-language editing instructions grounded in visible content. We also provide short instructions summarized by Qwen-2.5-Instruct-7B. Example:&lt;quote&gt;{ "instruction": "Change the red car to blue." }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Editing + Self-Evaluation The Nano-Banana model performs the edit, then automatically evaluates the result using a structured quality prompt that measures: Instruction Compliance (40%) Editing Realism (25%) Preservation Balance (20%) Technical Quality (15%) Only edits scoring above a strict threshold (~0.7) are labeled as successful, forming the main dataset; the remaining ~56K are retained as failure cases for robustness and preference learning.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nano-Banana-400K contains ~400K image editing data, covering a wide visual and semantic range drawn from real-world imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Pico-Banana-400K provides both breadth (diverse edit operations) and depth (quality-controlled multimodal supervision), making it a strong foundation for training and evaluating text-guided image editing models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pico-Banana-400K serves as a versatile resource for advancing controllable and instruction-aware image editing.&lt;lb/&gt; Beyond single-step editing, the dataset enables multi-turn, conversational editing and reward-based training paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pico-Banana-400K dataset is hosted on Apple’s public CDN.&lt;lb/&gt; You can download each component (single-turn, multi-turn, and preference data) using the provided manifest files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manifest files: sft link and preference link&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manifest file: multi-turn link&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Urls to download source images are provided along with edit instructions in sft link, preference link, and multi-turn link. If you hit rate limit with Flickr when downloading images, you can either request higher rate limit with Flickr or follow steps below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another way to download the source images is to download packed files train_0.tar.gz and train_1.tar.gz from Open Images, then map with the urls we provide. We also provide a sample mapping code here. Due to legal requirements, we cannot provide the source image files directly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Use your PCB itself as a USB C connector! This repo includes a KiCAD and EasyEDA library containing 10 and 14 Pin versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use this library in kicad, download the zip file, open the Plugin and Content Manager (PCM), click "Install from file" and choose the zip file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use this library in EasyEDA pro, import the .elibz files, or search the common library for "PCBTypeC_10P" or "PCBTypeC_14P" to add the symbol to your schematic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some other EDA tools like Altium support importing KiCAD footprints, and EasyEDA supports export to Altium and PADS. Double check against the same footprint in KiCAD or EasyEDA after import.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As a Bitmover, we want you to be able to bring your best self to work. We believe that a happy employee will put their best foot forward for the company, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Our Core Values&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our core values are designed to be unique to Bitmovin, a set of operational commandments designed to unite our team under one streamlined operational umbrella. They serve as our behavioural lens through which each employee should look through when it comes to knowing how to act on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Think through the customer lens.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create the best solutions to enable our customers to deliver the best experiences to the markets they serve. Go the extra mile to surprise and delight our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Own it.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take pride in your work and accomplish what you set out to do. See it through to completion. Find and provide solutions to problems and take initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Attack the idea, not the person.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engage in constructive conflict and get all ideas out in the open at the start of a project. Treat others respectfully and embrace new perspectives with an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Innovate relentlessly.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seek to learn continuously and cultivate a culture of innovation and curiosity. Adopt an always learning mindset and flex your idea muscles often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Execute and get results.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A strategy is just a theory unless it is executed. Plans, while important, don’t move the needle for the company. Results do. Look to create the highest impact, efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Writing a RISC-V Emulator in Rust&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: This project is actively ongoing. Pages are not perfect yet and it possible to change dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the book for writing a 64-bit RISC-V emulator from scratch in Rust. You can run xv6, a simple Unix-like OS, in your emulator once you finish the book.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll learn the basic computer architecture such as ISA, previleged architecture, exceptions, interrupts, peripheral devices, and virtual memory system from making an emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source code used in this book is available at d0iasm/rvemu-for-book.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chapter 1 shows all hardward components we need to implement for running &lt;code&gt;xv6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU with Two Instructions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory and System Bus&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Control and Status Registers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Privileged Architecture&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exceptions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PLIC (a platform-level interrupt controller) and CLINT (a core-local interrupter)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UART (a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interrupts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Virtio&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Virtual Memory System&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 shows all ISAs we need to implement for running &lt;code&gt;xv6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RV64I Base Integer Instruction Set&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"M" Standard Extension for Integer Multiplication and Division&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"A" Standard Extension for AtomicInstructions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outcome&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you read this book and implement the emulator, you will be able to run xv6 in your emulator!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optical Tweezers are scientific instruments to manipulate objects of microscopic size. These can be small plastic beads or biological material like cells. The trapping is achieved by focusing a laser beam on the dielectric particles that are then attracted to the region of strongest electric field, which is the center of the beam. The fact that samples under a microscope can be manipulated gives new possibilities to explore. The force applied on the object depends linearly on its displacement from the trap center just as with a simple spring system. Micro-beads can thus be used as handles and forces can be determined though the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main component of an optical tweezer are a microscope to see the sample, a laser beam focused on the sample to manipulate, special filter and lenses and a movable stage. The sum of this equipment as used in regular laboratories are usually big and quite expensive. The her after described devices uses only recycled parts from consumer electronics and comes at a fraction of the cost while still reproducing the original concept in a fully functional way. The work is based on the scientific publication “Single-cell isolation using a DVD optical pickup” [1]. The paper describes in detail the setup used and the circuit to power the laser. In fact the DVD head unit comprises some key components such as a powerful laser, a collimator lens as well as a focusing mechanism perfect for the application. However the setup as described in the paper still uses a conventional microscope and specialized filter to prevent the strong laser from shining into the microscope. In the presented setup these elements could further be replaced by using a USB computer web-cam and a filter made from a shutter disc synchronized with an intermittent switching of the small solid state laser. The compact unit of a “DIY Optical Tweezer” now weights less than 500g and can be built entirely from recycled consumer electronic parts at a cost of less than 100$. Small styrol beads were shown to be moved around with good accuracy and with a good image quality [2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Construction Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Construction Details of “DIY Laser Tweezer” [7]:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conventional DVD drive optical pickups emit a laser beam form a diode that passes through a diffraction grating, a polarizing beam splitter and is then collimated and focused onto a plane. The DVD drive unit is fixed on a ground plate with the laser pointing up. A glass slide is positioned in the focus plane of the laser. With the diffraction grating removed from the optical path, an output power of ~40 mW can be achieved in the primary beam, enough to obtain stable optical trapping. The objective lens of the optical pickup rests on an electromagnetically suspended frame that can be steered to control focus and and move the laser beam in one direction of the focus plane. The second axis to move the sample is constructed from a simple mechanical lever. On top of the device a USB computer web-cam looks down on the sample slide. By inverting the original lens of the web-cam and refocusing a good image can be recored on a computer through the USB connection and standard web-cam software with a magnification of ~400x [3]. To prevent overexposing of the camera by the laser beam a scatter disk made from black cardboard material with two slits of about 10° is positioned in the optical path just in front of the camera. The disk is rotated by a tiny cell-phone vibration motor (DC motor) at a speed of ~600rpm . The position of the slit is detected by an optical fork light barrier and synchronized with the DVD laser. The laser is turned of when the scatter disk opening is in front of the camera lens to prevent overexposure. The high sensitivity of the CMOS web-cam chip results in a good quality image despite the short and intermittent exposure. The sample is illuminated thought simple white LEDs from the side. To facilitate manipulation the laser is not turned off completely during the camera exposure but dimmed to give a weak pilot laser point. Due to the numerical aperture of ~0.6 the optics within the pickup, particles are not trapped in the vertical and are instead slightly pushed towards the top surface. A cover slip was used to limit the movement. The particles were suspended in water with a whiff of soap to reduce adhesion of the particle on the glass surface.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! I'm Eric Wastl. I make Advent of Code. I hope you like it! I also make lots of other things. I'm on Bluesky, Mastodon, and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to AoC++.&lt;/p&gt;it with others or directly via&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- General Tips ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck, try your solution against the examples given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers. If not, re-read the description. Did you misunderstand something? Is your program doing something you don't expect? After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, build some test cases for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program. Make sure you have the entire puzzle input. If you're still stuck, maybe ask a friend for help, or come back to the puzzle later. You can also ask for hints in the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- Frequently Asked Questions ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there an easy way to select entire code blocks? You should be able to triple-click code blocks to select them. You'll need JavaScript enabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print "You can test it out by ";
print "triple-clicking this code.\n";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does authentication work? Advent of Code uses OAuth to confirm your identity through other services. When you log in, you only ever give your credentials to that service - never to Advent of Code. Then, the service you use tells the Advent of Code servers that you're really you. In general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public; here are examples from Reddit and GitHub. Advent of Code will remember your unique ID, names, URL, and image from the service you use to authenticate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was this puzzle so easy / hard? The difficulty and subject matter varies throughout each event. Very generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time, but your specific skillset will make each puzzle significantly easier or harder for you than someone else. Making puzzles is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5? Because that's when I can consistently be available to make sure everything is working. I also have a family, a day job, and even need sleep occasionally. If you can't participate at midnight, that's not a problem; if you want to race, many people use private leaderboards to compete with people in their area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find the text on the site hard to read. Is there a high contrast mode? There is a high contrast alternate stylesheet. Firefox supports these by default (View -&amp;gt; Page Style -&amp;gt; High Contrast).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you? Please don't. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don't accept puzzle ideas, and I won't even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I find a bug with a puzzle? Once a puzzle has been out for even an hour, many people have already solved it; after that point, bugs are very unlikely. Start by asking on the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I try to get a fast solution time? Maybe. Solving puzzles is hard enough on its own, but trying for a fast time also requires many additional skills and a lot of practice; speed-solves often look nothing like code that would pass a code review. If that sounds interesting, go for it! However, you should do Advent of Code in a way that is useful to you, and so it is completely fine to choose an approach that meets your goals and ignore speed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did the number of days per event change? It takes a ton of my free time every year to run Advent of Code, and building the puzzles accounts for the majority of that time. After keeping a consistent schedule for ten years(!), I needed a change. The puzzles still start on December 1st so that the day numbers make sense (Day 1 = Dec 1), and puzzles come out every day (ending mid-December).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened to the global leaderboard? The global leaderboard was one of the largest sources of stress for me, for the infrastructure, and for many users. People took things too seriously, going way outside the spirit of the contest; some people even resorted to things like DDoS attacks. Many people incorrectly concluded that they were somehow worse programmers because their own times didn't compare. What started as a fun feature in 2015 became an ever-growing problem, and so, after ten years of Advent of Code, I removed the global leaderboard. (However, I've made it so you can share a read-only view of your private leaderboard. Please don't use this feature or data to create a "new" global leaderboard.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While trying to get a fast time on a private leaderboard, may I use AI / watch streamers / check the solution threads / ask a friend for help / etc? If you are a member of any private leaderboards, you should ask the people that run them what their expectations are of their members. If you don't agree with those expectations, you should find a new private leaderboard or start your own! Private leaderboards might have rules like maximum runtime, allowed programming language, what time you can first open the puzzle, what tools you can use, or whether you have to wear a silly hat while working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I use AI to solve Advent of Code puzzles? No. If you send a friend to the gym on your behalf, would you expect to get stronger? Advent of Code puzzles are designed to be interesting for humans to solve - no consideration is made for whether AI can or cannot solve a puzzle. If you want practice prompting an AI, there are almost certainly better exercises elsewhere designed with that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code? Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- Credits ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puzzles, Code, &amp;amp; Design: Eric Wastl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta Testing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tim Giannetti&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ben Lucek&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;JP Burke&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Aneurysm9&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Andrew Skalski&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community Managers: Danielle Lucek and Aneurysm9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing: You!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- Legal ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advent of Code is a registered trademark in the United States.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This monument popped up in the middle of Barking recently. I thought it was very recently but it was actually unveiled in April 2022 and I'm just not very observant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It says "In Memory of those who lost their lives because of exposure to asbestos".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it's here because Barking has one of the highest rates of asbestos-related deaths in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1913 the Cape Asbestos Company built a huge asbestos factory beside the River Roding in Barking. The company mined asbestos-bearing rock at several sites in South Africa, then shipped them in sacks to a private quay in Barking for processing. Hundreds of people were employed to mill the ore into usable fibres and then process these into lagging, packaging, pipes, resins, boards and all forms of insulation widely used in the building trade. They worked without masks or other protection, the dangers of asbestos either unknown or not thought worth bothering about. And hundreds of workers died, often many years later, of insidious chronic respiratory disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found a 32-page booklet published by Cape Asbestos in the days before blue asbestos was recognised as dangerous and banned, which was as late as 1985. It shows workers with rolled-up sleeves and women leaning over unshielded machines, all potentially inhaling enough fibres to ultimately kill them. I read reports about the local school in Barking, barely 100 metres away, saying that the playground was often covered in fine dust which children rolled up and played with as if it were snow. I read that mesothelioma was so common in the area it was known as the ‘Barking Cough’. These were different times, but times that linger on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cape Asbestos's plant eventually closed in 1968 and in its place was built the Harts Lane council estate, which is still not the loveliest corner of Barking. It included two tall tower blocks called Colne House and Mersey House, both of which Barking &amp;amp; Dagenham council would now like to demolish. This is chiefly because they're old and covered in combustible cladding, but the additional complications of potentially disturbing polluted land puts any remediation out of financial reach. It's always the insulation you have to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memorial in Barking Town Square comprises a polished chunk of blue pearl granite and was unveiled on Workers' Memorial Day 2022 in a ceremony attended by several trade unionists and representatives of the London Asbestos Support Awareness Group. The emphasis is partly on remembrance and partly on the importance of standing up for workers' rights to make conditions better for all. As the inscription says, "Remember the Dead and Fight for the Living".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My grandfather worked for another Cape Asbestos plant on Tolpits Lane in Watford. Originally it had been run by Universal Asbestos Manufacturing but in 1967 the factory was acquired by Cape as part of a diversification into cement-based products. They made corrugated roofing, flat sheets, decorated sheets, slates, soil pipes, decking for flat roofs and reinforced troughing - that kind of thing - the asbestos moulded into a multiplicity of shapes for the benefit of the building trade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To him Cape Universal was just a convenient place to work, a short walk across the moor for a day's shift and then home again for tea. He worked there for many years, from the 1930s to the 1960s, rising through the ranks from a labourer to a machine operator on the factory floor. On his death certificate his occupation was listed as 'Asbestos Moulder', and it was very much a premature death because this didn't end well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't remember very much about my grandfather because he died when I was 8. I know he was there when I took my first steps in his back garden and I can remember sitting at his dining room table and hoping nobody would force me to eat the celery. My final memory is being led up to his bedroom, I suspect not long before his death, to see an ill old man laid out in bed and struggling to breathe. I don't know what was said, nor how short a time I stayed in his presence, indeed my strongest recollection is of the room itself with its austere cupboards and the curtains drawn. And then at the age of 67 he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My family fought for asbestosis to be recognised as his cause of death but were not successful. I've read recently of fellow workers working at the Tolpits Lane factory now getting six figure payouts in compensation, indeed it's hard to research this topic without ending up on legal websites with popups urging you to make a claim. Even four decades after the factory's closure there are still employees severely affected, and many more already passed, as the toxic legacy endures. The factory site is now a rather cleaner industrial estate and business park, indeed it's where the National Lottery's been based for the last 30 years because risk and loss are still in play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today my Dad reaches the grand old age of 87, a full 20 years more than his father lived. Science has moved on a long way since the 1970s, also educational opportunities and also workers' rights. Health and safety is sometimes much derided but it can genuinely save lives, even much extend them, rather than everyone continually moaning about additional costs and annoying procedures. If someone had shouted earlier and louder about the dangers of asbestos I might have known my grandfather better, my grandmother could have had many more years of married life and my father could have had a father for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Dad lost his Dad at the age of 34, which is no age at all in the grand scheme of things. By contrast I still have my Dad at the age of 60, which has meant an extra quarter century of guidance, support, advice, love and always being there. How lucky am I? Every day we overlap with our parents is a blessing and I've had 22,000 of them, for all of which I'm truly grateful. We're off out later to celebrate with a slap-up dinner, or as slap-up as an 87-year-old stomach requires, which the wider family are greatly looking forward to. What Barking's memorial reminded me is that many families have not been so fortunate, and sometimes that loss can be very close to home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You already have a git server:&lt;/head&gt;(Programming)&lt;p&gt;If you have a git repository on a server with ssh access, you can just clone it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# This works. 
git clone ssh://username@hostname/path/to/repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can then work on it locally and push your changes back to the origin server. By default, git won’t let you push to the branch that is currently checked out, but this is easy to change:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Run this on the remote server. 
git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great way to sync code between multiple computers or to work on server-side files without laggy typing or manual copying. If you want to publish your code, just point your web server at the git repo:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://hostname/path/to/repo/.git
# You can get rid of the .git part of the command by either setting the
# server to remap it to a nicer URL or by just renaming the .git directory
# (although this stops you from running git server side)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;… although you will have to run this command server-side to make it cloneable:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Create some files used by git-over-http:
# Should be repeated after making changes.
git update-server-info
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of work, so let’s set up a hook to do that automatically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Automatically run git update-server-info.
# Should be run server-side
cp .git/hooks/post-update.sample .git/hooks/post-update
chmod a+x .git/hooks/post-update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Git hooks are just shell scripts, so they can do things like running a static site generator:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt; .git/hooks/post-update &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
#!/bin/sh
set -euo pipefail
cd /path/to/site
/path/to/generator
EOF
chmod a+x .git/hooks/post-update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how I’ve been doing this blog for a while now: It’s very nice to be able to type up posts locally (no network lag), and then push them to the server and have the rest handled automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also backed up by default: If the server breaks, I’ve still got the copy on my laptop, and if my laptop breaks, I can download everything from the server. Git’s version tracking also prevents accidental deletions, and if something breaks, it’s easy to figure out what caused it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The FSF considers large language models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;We're bad at marketingThe Free Software Foundation's Licensing and Compliance Lab concerns itself with many aspects of software licensing, Krzysztof Siewicz said at the beginning of his 2025 GNU Tools Cauldron session. These include supporting projects that are facing licensing challenges, collecting copyright assignments, and addressing GPL violations. In this session, though, there was really only one topic that the audience wanted to know about: the interaction between free-software licensing and large language models (LLMs).&lt;p&gt;We can admit it, marketing is not our strong suit. Our strength is writing the kind of articles that developers, administrators, and free-software supporters depend on to know what is going on in the Linux world. Please subscribe today to help us keep doing that, and so we don’t have to get good at marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anybody hoping to exit the session with clear answers about the status of LLM-created code was bound to be disappointed; the FSF, too, is trying to figure out what this landscape looks like. The organization is currently running a survey of free-software projects with the intent of gathering information about what position those projects are taking with regard to LLM-authored code. From that information (and more), the FSF eventually hopes to come up with guidance of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nick Clifton asked whether the FSF is working on a new version of the GNU General Public License — a GPLv4 — that takes LLM-generated code into account. No license changes are under consideration now, Siewicz answered; instead, the FSF is considering adjustments to the Free Software Definition first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Siewicz continued that LLM-generated code is problematic from a free-software point of view because, among other reasons, the models themselves are usually non-free, as is the software used to train them. Clifton asked why the training code mattered; Siewicz said that at this point he was just highlighting the concern that some feel. There are people who want to avoid proprietary software even when it is being run by others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Siewicz went on to say that one of the key questions is whether code that is created by an LLM is copyrightable and, if not, if there is some way to make it copyrightable. It was never said explicitly, but the driving issue seems to be whether this software can be credibly put under a copyleft license. Equally important is whether such code infringes on the rights of others. With regard to copyrightability, the question is still open; there are some cases working their way through the courts now. Regardless, though, he said that it seems possible to ensure that LLM output can be copyrighted by applying some human effort to enhance the resulting code. The use of a "&lt;quote&gt;creative prompt&lt;/quote&gt;" might also make the code copyrightable. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many years ago, he said, photographs were not generally seen as being copyrightable. That changed over time as people figured out what could be done with that technology and the creativity it enabled. Photography may be a good analogy for LLMs, he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; There is also, of course, the question of copyright infringements in code produced by LLMs, usually in the form of training data leaking into the model's output. Prompting an LLM for output "&lt;quote&gt;in the style of&lt;/quote&gt;" some producer may be more likely to cause that to happen. Clifton suggested that LLM-generated code should be submitted with the prompt used to create it so that the potential for copyright infringement can be evaluated by others. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Siewicz said that he does not know of any model that says explicitly whether it incorporates licensed data. As some have suggested, it could be possible to train a model exclusively on permissively licensed material so that its output would have to be distributable, but even permissive licenses require the preservation of copyright notices, which LLMs do not do. A related concern is that some LLMs come with terms of service that assert copyright over the model's output; incorporating such code into a free-software project could expose that project to copyright claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Siewicz concluded his talk with a few suggested precautions for any project that accepts LLM-generated code, assuming that the project accepts it at all. These suggestions mostly took the form of collecting metadata about the code. Submissions should disclose which LLM was used to create them, including version information and any available information on the data that the model was trained on. The prompt used to create the code should also be provided. The LLM-generated code should be clearly marked. If there are any use restrictions on the model output, those need to be documented as well. All of this information should be recorded and saved when the code is accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A member of the audience pointed out that the line between LLMs and assistive (accessibility) technology can be blurry, and that any outright ban of the former can end up blocking developers needing assistive technology, which nobody wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were some questions about how to distinguish LLM-generated code from human-authored code, given that some contributors may not be up-front about their model use. Clifton said that there must always be humans in the loop; they, in the end, are responsible for the code they submit. Jeff Law added that the developers certificate of origin, under which code is submitted to many projects, includes a statement that the contributor has the right to submit the code in question. Determining whether that right is something the contributor truly holds is not a new concern; developers could be, for example, submitting code that is owned by their employer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A real concern, Siewicz said, is whether contributors are sufficiently educated to know where the risks actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mark Wielaard said that developers are normally able to cite any inspirations for the code they write; an LLM is clearly inspired by other code, but is unable to make any such citations. So there is no way to really know where LLM-generated code came from. A developer would have to publish their entire session with the LLM to even begin to fill that in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The session came to an end with, perhaps, participants feeling that they had a better understanding of where some of the concerns are, but nobody walked out convinced that they knew the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A video of this session is available on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

I *could* get persuaded to link to the post in question in a comment before each included snippet. But that's also not something I've seen to be frequent. And if I didn't write the comment _the same moment_ I included said snippet, it's most likely I never will. So... I think there is an argumentative issue in here :-) Posted Oct 15, 2025 2:13 UTC (Wed) by Baughn (subscriber, #124425) [Link] (21 responses) - Discuss a problem with the LLM. The LLM autonomously reads large parts of the repository you’re working in, during the discussion. - Ask it to write a plan. Edit the plan. Ask it about the edited plan. Edit it some more. - Repeatedly restart the LLM, asking it to code different parts of the plan. Debug the results. Write some code yourself. Create, rebase, or otherwise play around with the repository; keep multiple branches of potential code. - Go back and edit the original plan, now that you know what might work. Port some unit tests back in time, sometimes. - Repeat until done. There is a prompt. Actually, there are many prompts, all conveniently stored in verbose JSONL that also requires point in time snapshots of the repository you’re working in to make sense of. If someone were to ask me for that, I wouldn’t know where to start. It’s like asking for a recording of my desktop so they can be sure I’m not doing something they disapprove of.

Well, even GPT-3 was definitely more than a rubber duck. Not necessarily 10x better, but still better. These recent models? I think they're genuinely useful also in domains that you don't know so well. An example (I could also give another from a domain I knew even less about, book binding, but this message is already long): I've been taking a deep dive into Rust for the past few days, and I don't think how I would replace the crate and approach suggestions I've got from LLMs. Probably the old-fashioned way, reading enough rust code to see what people do today, but I'm sure that would have been several times the effort. The same applies to them digging quickly the reason why a particular snippet makes the borrow checker unhappy and suggesting an alternative. One does not easily learn to search for `smallvec` without having ever heard of it. Or, today, diving into the interaction of process groups, sessions, their interaction with ptys (which I didn't know well), and "why on earth do I end up with a process tree like this"—the LLM taught be about subreapers, which I did not know and would not have easily guessed to search for. I think one problem is that people get angry if LLMs are not right 100% of the time. Even that seems a bit like "you're using it wrong". Don't rely on it to be right all the time. (As a side note, don't rely on humans to be either, unless they say very little.) Rely on it to give a big picture fast, which is where you might be after some time of self-study while still harboring misconceptions to be corrected—and much preferable to having no idea.

But how often has explaining the problem to a colleague resulted in you solving it, often without a word from said colleague? That's why a rubber duck / stuffed Tux / whatever is such a useful debugging aid. It might feel weird holding a conversation with an inanimate object, but don't knock it. It works ...

Eventually fed the errors to ChatGPT and it pointed out that version 5 and 6 use completely different configuration styles. No search engine would have told me that info. No website specifies which version they are using. And for one off scripts it's amazing. Hey, I need a script that does the steps X, Y and Z in Python. Here is the previous bash script that did this.

Posted Oct 20, 2025 2:14 UTC (Mon) by gmatht (subscriber, #58961) [Link] Like all C programmers, I can write C in any language. Sometimes when I start writing C in Python the LLM will offer to complete my involved algorithm with a 2 line pythonic solution. Also the LLM's initial draft of a UI looks nicer than the functional but plain version I would call v1.0. I seem to recall a quote saying something along the lines of: I will always write better code than a compiler/LLM, because I can use a compiler/LLM. The biggest weakness of LLMs seems to be that it is not possible to reach v1 with vibe coding because once the code base reaches a certain level of quality the LLM will become more interested in adding new bugs than fixing old ones. For example, it will find a polished algorithm and observe that the tests only cover several values so it can simplify the algorithm by just hardcoding those values and still "pass".

I previously tried for 4 full days before I realised I was no-where close, and gave up. I sat for an afternoon with Claude Code, and finished a full Python 3 translation. Claude found replacement libraries for things without a Python 3 version, wrote fresh implementations of a couple of functions that didn't get a Python 3 upgrade (I checked, it didn't just copy the originals), and helped me then fix up all the unicode issues from the Python 2 -&amp;gt; Python 3 upgrade process.

I've come to suspect that the usual difference between people who insist LLMs are absolutely useless and those who get a lot of good out of them is likely exactly that: Take a human who's likely not even very good at communicating textually (few of us are; technical writing is a discipline for a reason), have him write a single sloppy prompt and dismiss the results when the LLM was not able to read his mind.

Instead, it updated an unrelated config value that had a similar name to the library to be the name of the library. The config file was most emphatically _not_ part of the build system. If LLMs truly understood "context" like people claim, it should have ruled out touching that file completely. - generate a bunch of boilerplate for writing out new objects to a datastore that still needs boilerplate. Mostly got it right. - generate a dockerfile for me. It saved time and worked, but added an unusual amount of completely useless cruft. Still faster to quickly remove it then make it myself from scratch. - how to install a particular java version on my mac. Utterly failed. Kept on insisting on using a cask that no longer exists, on downloading it from locations that no longer hosted that particular version, etc. It was clearly just barfing up the suggestions from a bunch of outdated blogs. For something that has similar patterns in your codebase, or has plenty of (correct) examples in documentation and random websites, it can do great. For something novel or unique, even if it is something as banal as updating a library version by understanding it's pulled in transitively, and another library must be updated - or something both unique and genuinely interesting, LLMs fail miserably. Which is not surprising. They are useful tools, once you know how they work. And a remarkable amout of code is not really doing anything that novel or unique. For conversations about design, a co-worker or rubber duck is still much better for me.

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Myanmar military shuts down a major cybercrime center and detains over 2,000 people&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s military has shut down a major online scam operation near the border with Thailand, detaining more than 2,000 people and seizing dozens of Starlink satellite internet terminals, state media reported Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myanmar is notorious for hosting cyberscam operations responsible for bilking people all over the world. These usually involve gaining victims’ confidence online with romantic ploys and bogus investment pitches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The centers are infamous for recruiting workers from other countries under false pretenses, promising them legitimate jobs and then holding them captive and forcing them to carry out criminal activities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scam operations were in the international spotlight last week when the United States and Britain enacted sanctions against organizers of a major Cambodian cyberscam gang, and its alleged ringleader was indicted by a federal court in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to a report in Monday’s Myanma Alinn newspaper, the army raided KK Park, a well-documented cybercrime center, as part of operations starting in early September to suppress online fraud, illegal gambling, and cross-border cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It published photos displaying seized Starlink equipment and soldiers said to be carrying out the raid, though it was unclear when exactly they were taken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KK Park is located on the outskirts of Myawaddy, a major trading town on the border with Thailand in Myanmar’s Kayin state. The area is only loosely under the control of Myanmar’s military government, and also falls under the influence of ethnic minority militias.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, the spokesperson for the military government, charged in a statement Monday night that the top leaders of the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic organization opposed to army rule, were involved in the scam projects at KK Park.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allegation was previously made based on claims that a company backed by the Karen group allowed the land to be leased. However, the Karen, who are part of the larger armed resistance movement in Myanmar’s civil war, deny any involvement in the scams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myanma Alinn said the army ascertained that more than 260 buildings were unregistered, and seized equipment, including 30 sets of Starlink satellite internet terminals. It said 2,198 individuals were detained though it did not give their nationalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starlink is part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX company and the terminals link to its satellites. It does not have licensed operations in Myanmar, but at least hundreds of terminals have been smuggled into the Southeast Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company could not be immediately reached for comment Monday but its policy bans “conduct that is defamatory, fraudulent, obscene, or deceptive.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been previous crackdowns on cyberscam operations in Myanmar earlier this year and in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facing pressure from China, Thailand and Myanmar’s governments launched an operation in February in which they released thousands of trafficked people from scam compounds, working with the ethnic armed groups that rule Myanmar’s border areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bizarre Movie Posters From Africa That Are So Bad, They’re Good. Lets All Catch a Film in Ghana!&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Updated: 1 minute ago&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you get when you cross Hollywood, VHS tapes, and a bag of flour?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you were in Ghana in the late 1980s or 90s, the answer was pure, chaotic brilliance, hand-painted movie posters so wild, so bold, and so anatomically impossible, they’re now considered collectible art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of Ghanaian movie posters. They’re gory. They’re vibrant. They’re often hilarious. And they’re unlike anything you’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Birth of a Bizarre Art Form&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the 1980s, Ghana was in the midst of a cinematic revolution. While most of the Western world had access to video rental shops and cable channels, in Ghana, things worked a little differently. Imported VHS tapes were shown at mobile cinemas — makeshift screenings often set up in open-air markets, community halls, or anywhere a crowd could gather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter the travelling cinema operators, armed with a television set, a generator, a VCR… and a bag of posters that didn’t actually exist. See, most of these movies came without any promotional materials. No glossy posters. No slick advertising. So what did they do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They hired local artists to paint them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often working with nothing but word-of-mouth summaries or bootleg VHS covers as reference, these artists let their imaginations run completely wild — and the results were absolutely glorious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Painted on Flour Sacks, Fuelled by Imagination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The posters were typically painted on used flour sacks, sewn together and primed for colour. These weren’t just any flour sacks either — they were durable, easy to roll up, and ready for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the designs? Let’s just say they didn’t rely too heavily on accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sylvester Stallone often had twice the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Freddy Krueger was sometimes joined by snakes for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminator had glowing eyes, extra arms, and sometimes a bazooka, just for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t matter if the movie was a romantic comedy or a horror flick — there was always blood. Always at least one exploding head. And if you were lucky, a helicopter bursting into flames somewhere in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So Bad They’re Good — and Then Some&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first glance, these posters might just seem like bad art. But there’s a raw charm to them — a punk energy that doesn’t care about realism or proportions. A kind of outsider art that merges pop culture with folklore, action with absurdity, and makes every film feel like a blood-soaked fever dream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some posters, you’d swear the artist hadn’t even seen the film (and truthfully, many hadn’t). They often worked from second-hand descriptions or low-quality VHS box art, with creative liberties taken liberally. What mattered most was grabbing attention. And it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These posters were part of the marketing strategy,” said Ernie Wolfe, a collector and curator who helped bring these artworks to international galleries. “They were designed to get people to come to the screenings — and if that meant making the movie look crazier than it actually was, so be it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cult Status and Global Recognition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While they started as practical tools for cinema promotion, the posters gradually became art objects in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, international art collectors began taking notice. Exhibitions of Ghanaian movie posters began appearing in galleries in New York, London, Berlin, and Tokyo. The very posters once stapled to market walls were now being framed and auctioned off for thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most famous collectors, Wolfgang Held, even described them as “the African equivalent of underground comic book art.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Artists like Joe Mensah, Heavy J, and Stoger have since become cult icons among poster enthusiasts. Their work is now appreciated not just for its aesthetic — but for what it represents: ingenuity, adaptation, and a fierce kind of visual storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlights From the Genre&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are just a few favourites from the genre that perfectly capture the “so bad it’s good” energy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Terminator 2” – Arnie’s face is melting, he’s shirtless, and he’s riding a jet ski that doesn’t appear in the film.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Evil Dead” – Picture Ash but with a massive machine gun, a six-pack, and a demon emerging from his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Rocky IV” – Stallone is in boxing gloves and holding an Uzi, punching a guy who’s already on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Predator” – The alien creature is ten feet tall, has five heads, and breathes fire.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clear that accuracy wasn’t the point. The goal was excitement — and by that metric, they succeeded tenfold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why They Matter Today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These posters are more than just curiosities. They’re a glimpse into how global pop culture was interpreted and reimagined in West Africa. They show us what happens when traditional art practices collide with Hollywood cinema, in a setting with limited resources but unlimited creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also stand as symbols of resilience. With minimal tools and even less information, Ghanaian artists created an unforgettable visual language — one that still fascinates designers, filmmakers, and collectors to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And let’s be honest: in an age of Photoshop perfection, there’s something deeply refreshing about artwork that dares to be weird, off-kilter, and full of personality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hand-painted Ghanaian movie posters may be low-budget, but they’re high-impact. They’re messy, macabre, and magnificently over-the-top. And that’s exactly why people can’t stop looking at them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the next time you see a dull, corporate movie poster at your local cinema, just imagine what a Ghanaian artist might have done with it — and wish, for just a moment, that you were standing in a dusty market square with a cold Fanta, a plastic chair, and the promise of carnage on VHS.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Defending&lt;lb/&gt;Organic Literature&lt;lb/&gt;in an AI World. &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We certify publishers as producers of human-authored books, with a process readers can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About Us&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Books By People is a new independent organisation that partners with publishers to verify and certify human-written books, safeguarding creative integrity and public confidence in an AI-driven era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Crisis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI is flooding the literary world with imitations of human storytelling, challenging the publishing world to respond. Without safeguards, authentic human work will inevitably struggle to maintain the visibility and credibility it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To uphold a trusted and recognisable âOrganic Literatureâ market by supporting publishers and authors who champion human writing, and by making that commitment clear and valuable to readers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Our Process Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We work collaboratively with publishers to verify internal systems are in place and accessible to staff. Our certification lets you display the Books By People stamp on books and marketing, affirming your commitment to human authorship and that titles meet our standards.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Intelligent Compression - 99.5% file size reduction with RGB color preservation &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;CWAM-inspired approach (arXiv:2410.21144) implemented purely in Python&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cross-window saliency analysis (multi-scale feature extraction)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Temporal subsampling (10fps → 8fps) and adaptive resolution scaling&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Saliency-based quality preservation (variance + edge density + entropy)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;No ML models required - pure PIL/NumPy implementation&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Integration - Save sessions for Claude, Gemini, Codex&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auto-Cleanup - Delete files older than N hours&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-Platform - Windows, macOS, Linux (native support for each)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Production Ready - Full CI/CD, pytest suite, Sphinx docs, PyPI-ready structure&lt;/item&gt;

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gnome-screenshot&lt;/code&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Session Save: ~50ms&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;"The fastest, simplest screen capture for developers"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FlashRecord is built for developers who need reliable, scriptable screen recording without GUI overhead. Our mission is to be the Python ecosystem's go-to tool for screen capture automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python-Native Integration: The only screen recorder you can &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;and use directly in Python scripts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Intelligent Compression: CWAM-inspired approach achieving 99.5% reduction with pure PIL/NumPy (no ML models)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero-Configuration CLI: &lt;code&gt;@sc&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;@sv&lt;/code&gt;- that's it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-Platform Consistency: Same commands, same behavior on Windows/macOS/Linux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Production-Ready: Full CI/CD, pytest coverage, Sphinx docs, PyPI structure&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;v0.4.0 - Enhanced Formats (Planned Q1 2025)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WebP video format support (smaller than GIF)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MP4 export option (H.264 codec)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PNG sequence export for video editors&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;v0.5.0 - GUI &amp;amp; Integration (Planned Q2 2025)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gradio web interface for non-CLI users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VSCode extension for in-editor capture&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Jupyter notebook integration (&lt;code&gt;%%flashrecord&lt;/code&gt;magic)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;v0.6.0 - Advanced Features (Planned Q3 2025)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real-time streaming to Twitch/YouTube&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Window-specific capture (not just full screen)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audio recording integration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cloud sync (S3/GCS/Azure optional)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;v1.0.0 - Enterprise (Planned Q4 2025)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Team collaboration features&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encrypted storage options&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;REST API server mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Docker containerization&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Active Use: FlashRecord is battle-tested in production AI development workflows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear Architecture: Standard src/ layout, comprehensive tests, full CI/CD&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PyPI Ready: Professional packaging structure ready for public release&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Community Need: Fills gap for Python-native cross-platform screen recording&lt;/item&gt;
