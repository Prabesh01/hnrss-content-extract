  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Question: Can we improve temporal reasoning by learning better representations?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Method: A novel negative sampling scheme provably enables learning temporal representations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result: CRTR learns representations that enable solving Rubik's Cube without hand-crafted heuristics and improves the success rates overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In classical AI, perception relies on learning spatial representations, while planning—temporal reasoning over action sequences—is typically achieved through search. We study whether such reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both spatial and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning, despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure, due to reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik’s Cube. In particular, for the Rubik’s Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow solving the puzzle much faster than BestFS—though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of efficiently solving arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations, without hand-crafted search heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRTR performs well in all the evaluated domains. Success rate as a function of search budget across five domains. CRTR compared to baselines: CRL, Supervised and DeepCubeA. Results are averaged over 5 seeds; shaded regions indicate standard error. For the Rubik's Cube, both the supervised and random baselines achieve a success rate of zero for all search budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distances given by CRTR representations reflect the temporal structure well. Correlation (Spearman's ρ) between the distance induced by learned embeddings and actual distance across the training, CRTR compared with CRL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRTR solves most tasks without requiring any search. Adding BestFS results in shorter solutions. We plot the fraction of configurations solved with a solution length of at most x, while limiting the number of nodes created to 6000. Surprisingly, on the Rubik's cube CRTR achieves a higher success rate without search, solving all board configurations within the budget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRTR without search exhibits a block-building-like behavior. Intermediate states from solving a randomly scrambled cube, illustrating how the algorithm gradually builds partial structure. The average solve is about 400 moves, and we see similar block building behavior across solves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I heard someone say that Bitcoin is dangerous because you could easily make a typo when entering an address, sending money to the wrong person, and have no recourse. There are dangers associated with Bitcoin, such as losing a private key, but address typos are not a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Checksums&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several kinds of Bitcoin addresses. Each is at least 20 bytes (160 bits) long, with at least 4 bytes (32 bits) of checksum. The chances of a typo resulting in a valid checksum are about 1 in 232.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Used addresses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s ignore the checksum for this section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because addresses are formed by cryptographic hash functions, we can assume the values are essentially randomly distributed in the space of possible addresses. The addresses are deterministic, but for modeling purposes, random is as random does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means a typo of an actual address is no more or less likely to be another actual address than an address typed at random. This is unlike, say, English words: a mistyped English word is more likely to be another English word than random keystrokes would be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been on the order of a billion Bitcoin addresses used, in a space of 2160 possibilities. (Actually more since some addresses have more than 160 bits.) There’s about a 1 in 1039 chance that a random 160-bit sequence corresponds to an address somewhere on the Bitcoin blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Addresses close in edit distance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone with the Caesarean handle Veni Vidi Vici on X asked&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What about the odds that out of those 1B addresses, two of them are one character swap away from each other?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s an interesting question. Let’s assume the addresses are Base58-encoded strings of length 26. Addresses could be longer, but assuming the minimum length increases the probability of addresses being close.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many addresses are within one or two character swaps of another? I addressed a similar question here a couple weeks ago. If all the characters were unique, the number of strings within k swaps of each other would be&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;|S1(26, 26 − k)|&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where S1 denotes Stirling numbers of the first kind. For k = 1 this would be 325 and for k = 2 this would be 50,050. This assumes all the characters are unique; I haven’t thought through the case where characters are repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For round numbers, let’s say there are a billion addresses, and for each address there are a million other addresses that are close in some sense, plausible typos of the address. That would be 1012 addresses and typos, spread out in a space of ≈1045 (i.e. 5826) possible addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there’s an implicit Birthday Problem here. No particular address is likely to collide with another, even when you allow typos, but what about the likelihood that some address collides?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say we partition our space of 1045 addresses into N = 1029 addresses with a million possible typos for each address. Then as a rule of thumb, you’d need around √N random draws before you have a 50-50 chance of seeing a collision. Since 109 is a lot less than 1014.5, it’s unlikely that any two addresses collide, even when you consider each address along with a million associated typos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Updates to Consumer Terms and Privacy Policy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we're rolling out updates to our Consumer Terms and Privacy Policy that will help us deliver even more capable, useful AI models. We're now giving users the choice to allow their data to be used to improve Claude and strengthen our safeguards against harmful usage like scams and abuse. Adjusting your preferences is easy and can be done at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These updates apply to users on our Claude Free, Pro, and Max plans, including when they use Claude Code from accounts associated with those plans. They do not apply to services under our Commercial Terms, including Claude for Work, Claude Gov, Claude for Education, or API use, including via third parties such as Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By participating, you’ll help us improve model safety, making our systems for detecting harmful content more accurate and less likely to flag harmless conversations. You’ll also help future Claude models improve at skills like coding, analysis, and reasoning, ultimately leading to better models for all users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re always in control of this setting and whether we use your data in this way. If you’re a new user, you can select your preference in the signup process. Existing users will see the choice in a pop-up window like the one below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting today, we’re rolling out notifications so you can review these updates and manage your settings. If you’re an existing user, you have until September 28, 2025 to accept the updated Consumer Terms and make your decision. If you choose to accept the new policies now, they will go into effect immediately. These updates will apply only to new or resumed chats and coding sessions. After September 28, you’ll need to make your selection on the model training setting in order to continue using Claude. You can change your choice in your Privacy Settings at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extended data retention&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also extending data retention to five years, if you allow us to use your data for model training. This updated retention length will only apply to new or resumed chats and coding sessions, and will allow us to better support model development and safety improvements. If you delete a conversation with Claude it will not be used for future model training. If you do not choose to provide your data for model training, you’ll continue with our existing 30-day data retention period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new five-year retention period will also apply to feedback you submit to us about Claude’s responses to prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To protect users’ privacy, we use a combination of tools and automated processes to filter or obfuscate sensitive data. We do not sell users’ data to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find more details about the Consumer Terms and Privacy Policy updates in our FAQ section below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What’s changing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We will train new models using data from Free, Pro, and Max accounts when this setting is on (including when you use Claude Code from these accounts).&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you’re a current user, you can select your preference now and your selection will immediately go into effect. This setting will only apply to new or resumed chats and coding sessions on Claude. Previous chats with no additional activity will not be used for model training. You have until September 28, 2025 to make your selection.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you’re a new user, you can pick your setting for model training during the signup process.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can change your selection at any time in your Privacy Settings.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We are also expanding our data retention period to five years if you allow us to use your data for model improvement, with this setting only applying to new or resumed chats and coding sessions. If you don't choose this option, you will continue with our existing 30-day data retention period.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These updates do not apply to services under our Commercial Terms, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude for Work, which includes our Team and Enterprise plans&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our API, Amazon Bedrock, or Google Cloud’s Vertex API&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Gov and Claude for Education&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why are you making this change?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All large language models, like Claude, are trained using large amounts of data. Data from real-world interactions provide valuable insights on which responses are most useful and accurate for users. For example, when a developer debugs code by collaborating with an AI model, that interaction offers valuable signals that help improve future models on similar coding tasks. This creates a feedback loop that helps models get better over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s up to you to choose whether to allow your data to be used to improve new Claude models and you can change your choice anytime in your Privacy Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why are you extending the data retention period?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI development cycles span years—models released today began development 18 to 24 months ago. Keeping data consistent across the training process helps make the models more consistent, too: models trained on similar data will respond, reason, and produce outputs in similar ways, making the changes between model upgrades much smoother for users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extended retention period also helps us improve our classifiers—systems that help us identify misuse—to detect harmful usage patterns. These systems get better at identifying activity like abuse, spam, or misuse when they can learn from data collected over longer periods, helping us keep Claude safe for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you change your setting on providing your data for training or delete your account, we'll exclude your data from future model training. If you delete individual chats, they won't be included in future training either. Learn more about our data retention practices here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What action do I need to take?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current users will see an in-app notification asking whether you want to share your chats and coding sessions for model improvement. You can make your selection right away, or select "not now" and decide later. You have until September 28, 2025 to make your choice. If you choose this option, the updated 5-year data retention policy will also immediately apply to new and resumed chats and coding sessions. Once September 28 arrives, you'll need to select your preference to continue using Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're signing up for Claude today, you'll see this decision as part of the signup flow. And remember—you can always update your preference in Privacy Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What happens if I allow my data to be used for model training and then change my mind?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can always update your selection in your Privacy Settings. If you decide to turn off the model training setting, we will not use any new chats and coding sessions you have with Claude for future model training. Your data will still be included in model training that has already started and in models that have already been trained, but we will stop using your previously stored chats and coding sessions in future model training runs.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re an existing user, you have until September 28, 2025 to accept the updated Consumer Terms and make your decision. If you choose to accept the new policies now, they will go into effect immediately. These updates will apply only to new or resumed chats and coding sessions. After September 28, you’ll need to make your selection on the model training setting in order to continue using Claude. You can change your choice in your Privacy Settings at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extended data retention&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also extending data retention to five years, if you allow us to use your data for model training. This updated retention length will only apply to new or resumed chats and coding sessions, and will allow us to better support model development and safety improvements. If you delete a conversation with Claude it will not be used for future model training. If you do not choose to provide your data for model training, you’ll continue with our existing 30-day data retention period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new five-year retention period will also apply to feedback you submit to us about Claude’s responses to prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To protect users’ privacy, we use a combination of tools and automated processes to filter or obfuscate sensitive data. We do not sell users’ data to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find more details about the Consumer Terms and Privacy Policy updates in our FAQ section below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What’s changing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We will train new models using data from Free, Pro, and Max accounts when this setting is on (including when you use Claude Code from these accounts).&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you’re a current user, you can select your preference now and your selection will immediately go into effect. This setting will only apply to new or resumed chats and coding sessions on Claude. Previous chats with no additional activity will not be used for model training. You have until September 28, 2025 to make your selection.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you’re a new user, you can pick your setting for model training during the signup process.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can change your selection at any time in your Privacy Settings.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We are also expanding our data retention period to five years if you allow us to use your data for model improvement, with this setting only applying to new or resumed chats and coding sessions. If you don't choose this option, you will continue with our existing 30-day data retention period.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These updates do not apply to services under our Commercial Terms, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude for Work, which includes our Team and Enterprise plans&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our API, Amazon Bedrock, or Google Cloud’s Vertex API&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Gov and Claude for Education&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why are you making this change?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All large language models, like Claude, are trained using large amounts of data. Data from real-world interactions provide valuable insights on which responses are most useful and accurate for users. For example, when a developer debugs code by collaborating with an AI model, that interaction offers valuable signals that help improve future models on similar coding tasks. This creates a feedback loop that helps models get better over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s up to you to choose whether to allow your data to be used to improve new Claude models and you can change your choice anytime in your Privacy Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why are you extending the data retention period?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI development cycles span years—models released today began development 18 to 24 months ago. Keeping data consistent across the training process helps make the models more consistent, too: models trained on similar data will respond, reason, and produce outputs in similar ways, making the changes between model upgrades much smoother for users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extended retention period also helps us improve our classifiers—systems that help us identify misuse—to detect harmful usage patterns. These systems get better at identifying activity like abuse, spam, or misuse when they can learn from data collected over longer periods, helping us keep Claude safe for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you change your setting on providing your data for training or delete your account, we'll exclude your data from future model training. If you delete individual chats, they won't be included in future training either. Learn more about our data retention practices here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What action do I need to take?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current users will see an in-app notification asking whether you want to share your chats and coding sessions for model improvement. You can make your selection right away, or select "not now" and decide later. You have until September 28, 2025 to make your choice. If you choose this option, the updated 5-year data retention policy will also immediately apply to new and resumed chats and coding sessions. Once September 28 arrives, you'll need to select your preference to continue using Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're signing up for Claude today, you'll see this decision as part of the signup flow. And remember—you can always update your preference in Privacy Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What happens if I allow my data to be used for model training and then change my mind?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can always update your selection in your Privacy Settings. If you decide to turn off the model training setting, we will not use any new chats and coding sessions you have with Claude for future model training. Your data will still be included in model training that has already started and in models that have already been trained, but we will stop using your previously stored chats and coding sessions in future model training runs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ZDNET's key takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta could be scanning your camera roll right now.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's using your photos to provide AI-powered suggestions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check Facebook settings to turn off the features.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta could be analyzing and retaining your phone's photos without your explicit consent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some Facebook users have noticed that, deep within their app settings, Meta has switched on two toggles that allow it to access their camera roll to offer AI-powered suggestions, including "personalized creative ideas, like travel highlights and collages."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: How to delete Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram - if you want Meta out of your life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem? The toggles for the AI suggestion features, called "camera roll sharing suggestions," appear to be turned on for users who claim they haven't seen a pop-up from Facebook asking for permission to enable them. If you get that "cloud processing" pop-up and tap "Allow" on it, you'll agree to Meta's AI Terms of Service and permit your "media and facial features" to be analyzed by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facebook will then use your camera roll images -- including the dates on them and the presence of people or objects -- to suggest collages, themed albums, recap posts, or AI restyled versions of your pictures. These AI suggestions are only visible to you, unless you choose to share them, and Meta says the media won't be used for ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, to be clear, you're still giving Meta the right to access and retain your camera roll images, and that could raise serious privacy concerns, especially for users who never knowingly opted in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZDNET's editorial director found Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions enabled in her Facebook app without her knowledge. I also noticed they were enabled for me, although I vaguely recall seeing a pop-up from Facebook about the new features a few weeks ago. I think I dismissed it quickly, and I can't remember whether I tapped Allow or Don't allow on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to stop Facebook from scanning your camera roll&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta said its camera roll sharing suggestions are not enabled by default. If you're worried you dismissed Facebook's pop-up, unknowingly opted-in, and gave access to your camera roll, here's how to check and turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Open the Facebook app&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The settings you'll want to check can be found in the Facebook mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grab your iPhone or Android phone.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open the Facebook app. You'll need to be signed into your account.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Go to the Menu &amp;gt; Settings and Privacy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facebook hides most of its settings in the menu -- the three-line hamburger icon in the bottom corner of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tap the Menu icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once the menu opens, look for Settings and Privacy with a gear icon. This will take you directly to Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Select Settings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you find and tap Privacy and Settings to expand the dropdown options, tap Settings again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Under Settings and Privacy, tap Settings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Now, scroll down and look for "Camera roll sharing suggestions."&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Go to Camera roll sharing suggestions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta placed the toggles that grant it access to your camera roll under the "Camera roll sharing suggestions" setting. You'll need to go there to see if they're on and, if so, switch them off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Look for the option labeled "Camera roll sharing suggestions" and tap it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This will open a preference page with a couple of toggles.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Turn off both toggles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you're inside the camera roll sharing suggestions page, notice the two separate switches. If they're blue and the toggle circle is pushed to the right, they're on -- meaning Meta is already processing and retaining your phone's photos. Turn them off so the app can't automatically upload and analyze your camera roll.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find the option labeled "Get camera roll suggestions when you're browsing Facebook." If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from using basic camera roll data, such as which videos you've favorited and when photos were taken, to suggest sharing media you haven't yet uploaded.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Find the option labeled "Get creative ideas made for you by allowing camera roll cloud processing." If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from continuously uploading media from your camera roll -- and using details like time, location, themes, and the presence of people or objects -- to generate personalized creative ideas such as recaps and AI restylings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Where is this feature being tested?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, "We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Did Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they found the toggles in their settings already switched on by default, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I remove my photos once they've been uploaded?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is this a potential privacy issue?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Editor's note: This article was updated on Aug. 24, 2025 to clarify that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are here to revolutionize how data teams work together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started Deepnote to help data teams solve the hardest problems. We don’t just need better algorithms, bigger data sets, and more computing power. We need tools that help us explore, collaborate, and share. These tools don’t exist yet. We need to invent them first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data work is as much a scientific and creative process as it is an engineering one. It involves working together, failing, learning, and going back to the drawing board. Data professionals are explorers. To make projects successful, we need tools that are both powerful and easy to use. Tools that help us collaborate and share our work in an engaging way. Tools that make working with data fun again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re building the new standard in data tooling: a notebook that brings teams together to code, query, visualize, organize, and share — all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In the Eighth Circuit, the Fight Over Sig Sauer’s P320 FMECA Goes Public&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The secrecy battle over the Army’s Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) for Sig Sauer’s P320 has followed Glasscock v. Sig Sauer to the Eighth Circuit. A media intervenor is now asking the appellate court to keep key records open—and their brief places Practical Shooting Insights (this site) squarely in the middle of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s new&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Trace intervenes in the appeal. The newsroom moved to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing sealed filings tied to class certification and the FMECA, arguing the public’s right of access and noting the district court cited the FMECA nine times when it certified the class.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sig Sauer says “national security” and asks for deference to the Army. In opposing intervention, Sig Sauer urges the court to leave FMECA-related material sealed and to give the Army time to weigh in, framing the dispute in terms of protecting “military secrets.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A second FMECA document emerges. Sig Sauer’s opposition confirms there are two FMECA records in the class-certification exhibits: a FMECA Spreadsheet and a FMECA Memorandum—the latter not previously described in public filings—raising fresh questions about what the memo contains and who authored it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PSI’s reporting is part of the record. The Trace’s filing tells the court the unredacted FMECA was found on CourtListener, de‑obscured, and published on Practical Shooting Insights, where it “remains available”—and it recounts Sig Sauer’s own executive discussing it on a podcast while pointing viewers to this website.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FMECA document was previously published here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Trace’s pitch: This isn’t secret anymore&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trace walks the appellate court through how the FMECA left the bottle: it was posted on this website and then widely republished; a YouTube explainer discussing it surpassed 100,000 views. The filing quotes Sig Sauer’s VP of Consumer Affairs Phil Strader being asked on the Behind the Lens podcast why the FMECA shouldn’t be public and responding, “No, there’s not” (nothing to hide), while directing viewers to this website to see the document and describing its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reporting regarding Phil Strader’s interview was previously published here&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many times has the unredacted FMECA been “shared”? The filings don’t give a precise share count. What they do document is widespread republication and discussion, including the 100k‑plus video and multiple re‑posts mirroring the PSI copy. In other words, the genie is out of the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trace also points to DoD Instruction 5230.24, the policy Sig Sauer invokes, noting it does not authorize withholding unclassified information about evaluations of performance and reliability of military equipment—and that the PSI‑hosted FMECA bears no DoD distribution markings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sig Sauer’s response: Let the Army decide—and keep the lid on&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sig Sauer tells the Eighth Circuit The Trace lacks standing and that parallel briefing is already underway in the district court. Substantively, Sig Sauer leans on military‑secrets concerns, requests time for the Army to opine on release, and characterizes the FMECA as controlled technical information created under the MHS contract. (The company also recounts how the spreadsheet briefly became public in another case before being pulled down.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two details in Sig Sauer’s papers matter going forward:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1) The “FMECA Memorandum.” Sig Sauer identifies the memo alongside the previously published spreadsheet. If the memo is Sig Sauer‑authored, it could reveal how the company framed the Army analysis internally—an issue directly relevant to notice, risk mitigation, and marketing claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2) Ongoing Army communications. Sig Sauer’s litigation counsel filed a declaration stating he asked the Army about the FMECA’s distribution status and that key Army decision‑makers were unavailable the week of the deadline; Sig Sauer says the Army may submit information and seeks additional time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The transparency question, distilled&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is the FMECA “national‑security” material? The Trace says no—and points to DoDI 5230.24’s carve‑out: it does not provide authority to withhold unclassified evaluations of performance and reliability—exactly what a FMECA is. It also underscores the lack of any DoD marking on the PSI copy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is secrecy even possible at this point? The record shows the unredacted spreadsheet is online on this website, has been reposted broadly, and has been discussed by Sig Sauer’s own executive on air—who told listeners where to find it. One video discussing it has 100,000+ views.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this matters to the class action—and to owners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The district court relied on the FMECA repeatedly when certifying the Missouri class, including on notice and risk‑mitigation questions—the very issues consumers care about. Keeping the heart of that analysis under seal on appeal would blunt the public’s ability to scrutinize a product‑safety fight with real‑world consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My role, plainly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practical Shooting Insights is an independent site covering the shooting‑sports and firearms industry. The Trace’s filing names PSI as the first publisher of the unredacted spreadsheet and quotes Strader pointing viewers here. I will continue to publish filings and analysis so readers can compare the arguments to the documents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What to watch next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1) Whether the Eighth Circuit permits intervention and applies the strong presumption of public access to class‑certification records.&lt;lb/&gt; 2) If the Army weighs in—and on what basis—regarding the FMECA’s distribution status.&lt;lb/&gt; 3) Disclosure of the FMECA Memorandum. If it’s Sig Sauer-authored, it could illuminate internal framing of hazards and fixes—material at the core of consumer‑protection claims.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cash Cow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&amp;amp;P Global.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The federal Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;David vs. Goliath&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;State Solutions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Deploying DeepSeek with PD Disaggregation and Large-Scale Expert Parallelism on 96 H100 GPUs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by: The SGLang Team, May 05, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is a popular open-source large language model (LLM) praised for its strong performance. However, its large size and unique architecture, which uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE), require an advanced system for efficient serving at scale. In this blog, we explain how we match DeepSeek's inference system performance with SGLang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our implementation, shown in the figure above, runs on 12 nodes in the Atlas Cloud, each equipped with 8 H100 GPUs. It uses prefill-decode disaggregation and large-scale expert parallelism (EP), achieving a speed of 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second per node for 2000-token input sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first open-source implementation to nearly match the throughput reported in the official DeepSeek blog at large scale. By deploying this implementation locally, it translates to a cost of $0.20/1M output tokens, which is about one-fifth the cost of the official DeepSeek Chat API. Compared to vanilla tensor parallelism using the same resources, this optimized strategy improves the output throuhgput by up to 5x. This blog dives into our parallelism design, optimization methods, and results. All components of our work are fully open-source, allowing others to explore and build on our efforts. The instructions for reproducing our experiments are fully available here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ SGLang now supports prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation and large-scale EP, including the full functionality of DeepEP, DeepGEMM, and EPLB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ Leveraging these new features, our team successfully replicated DeepSeek's inference system using 12 nodes, each with 8 H100 GPUs. In total, SGLang achieves a throughput of 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second per node for input sequences of 2000 tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ This blog explains technical details of our approach, focusing on optimizations for efficiency, peak memory usage reduction, and workload balancing. The profile results show that our implementation achieves nearly on-par performance with the official DeepSeek’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ All experiments and code are fully open-sourced for community access and further development.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parallelism Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efficient parallelism is essential to manage the computational complexity and memory demands of DeepSeek's architecture. This section outlines our approach to optimizing key components: attention layers, dense feed-forward networks (FFNs), sparse FFNs, and the language model (LM) head. Each component leverages tailored parallelism strategies to enhance scalability, memory efficiency, and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Attention Layers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek employs Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) to effectively model complex dependencies within input sequences. To optimize this mechanism, we implement DP Attention, a data parallelism strategy that eliminates KV cache duplication across devices, significantly reducing memory overhead. Introduced in SGLang v0.4, this approach has been extended to support hybrid data and tensor parallelism, offering flexibility for processing small batch sizes efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Dense FFNs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite using only three dense FFN layers, DeepSeek-V3's computation can significantly increase peak memory usage, potentially leading to system crashes if not carefully managed. To address this, we adopt Data Parallelism (DP) over tensor parallelism (TP), leveraging the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enhanced Scalability: With an intermediate dimension of 18,432, high TP degrees (e.g., TP32) result in inefficient fragmentation into small-unit segments (e.g., 576 units), which are not divisible by 128—a common alignment boundary for modern GPUs such as H100. This misalignment hampers computational efficiency and memory utilization. DP provides a more scalable solution by avoiding fragmentation, ensuring balanced workload distribution across devices.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized Memory Efficiency: Traditionally, TP reduces memory usage as worker size increases, but this advantage diminishes under DP attention. In a pure TP setup, memory demand for a single-layer Transformer model scales with DP size as: $$\text{Memory}=\frac{N_{\text{param}}}{\text{TP}}+(1+k)N_{\text{hidden_state}}\cdot \text{DP}\notag$$ Here, $N_{\text{hidden_state}}=n_\text{token}\times n_\text{hidden_size}$ is the size of the hidden state on each device (DP rank), $N_{\text{param}}=n_\text{intermediate_size}\times n_\text{hidden_size}$ is the number of model parameters, and $k$ is a coefficient representing extra memory overhead from CUDA Graph duplication. By assuming $\text{DP}=\text{TP}$, this memory usage function is minimized when $\text{TP}=\sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{param}}}{(1+k)N_{\text{hidden_state}}}}$. DeepSeek-V3 uses an intermediate size of 18,432. During the prefill phase, CUDA Graph is typically disabled, so $k = 0$. However, the token size per device can easily exceed 2,048, resulting in an optimal TP size of 3 or less. In the decode phase, a practical configuration might use 128 tokens per device and set $k = 3$. In this case, the memory-optimal TP size is 6. In both phases, a lower TP degree minimizes memory usage per device. As a result, DP may offer a more memory-efficient approach for scaling compared to relying solely on TP.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimized Communication Overhead: In pure TP, each FFN necessitates two all-reduce operations, resulting in substantial communication overhead. By leveraging DP, we optimize this process to a single reduce-scatter following the prior attention layer and an all-gather before the next, reducing communication costs by 50%. Furthermore, when attention is also computed under pure DP, inter-device communication is entirely eliminated, significantly enhancing overall efficiency.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The integration of DP dense FFN with DP attention is illustrated in the left figure below. Users can enable this feature by setting &lt;code&gt;--moe-dense-tp-size=1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sparse FFNs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In DeepSeek-V3's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, sparse FFNs require substantial expert weights, creating a significant memory bottleneck. To address this, we implement Expert Parallelism (EP), which distributes expert weights across multiple devices. This approach effectively scales memory capacity while maintaining high performance, though it does introduce challenges like irregular all-to-all communication and workload imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The figure in the right figure above illustrates our EP implementation using the DeepEP framework, with further details on our EP design and optimizations provided in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LM Head&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LM head computes output probabilities over a large vocabulary, a resource-intensive operation traditionally handled with vocabulary parallelism to aggregate token logits from TP groups. To enhance scalability and efficiency, we adopt Data Parallelism (DP), mirroring our dense FFN strategy. This reduces memory overhead and simplifies communication across devices, delivering a more streamlined solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prefill and Decode Disaggregation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLM inference comprises two distinct phases: Prefill and Decode. The Prefill phase is computation-intensive, processing the entire input sequence, while the Decode phase is memory-intensive, managing the Key-Value (KV) cache for token generation. Traditionally, these phases are handled within a unified engine, where combined scheduling of prefill and decode batches introduces inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we introduce Prefill and Decode (PD) Disaggregation in SGLang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Issues with Unified Scheduling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conventional unified engine, which processes prefill and decode batches together, results in three significant problems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefill Interruption: Incoming prefill batches frequently interrupt ongoing decode batches, causing substantial delays in token generation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DP Attention Imbalance: In DP attention, one DP worker may process a prefill batch while another handles a decode batch simultaneously, leading to increased decode latency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Incompatible with DeepEP: As we will discuss in a later section, DeepEP executes different dispatch modes for prefill and decode, making unified scheduling imcompatible with DeepEP.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PD Disaggregation resolves these by separating the two stages, enabling tailored optimizations for each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementation Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PD Disaggregation design in SGLang, depicted in the diagram below, interleaves execution between a Prefill Server and a Decode Server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon receiving an input request, the workflow proceeds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Prefill Server and a Decode Server pair via a handshake, establishing a local sender and receiver, respectively.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Decode Server pre-allocates the KV cache, signaling the Prefill Server to begin the model forward pass and compute the KV caches.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once computed, the data transfers to the Decode Server, which handles iterative token generation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This separation ensures each phase operates under optimal conditions, maximizing GPU resource utilization. To further enhance performance, our implementation incorporates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-blocking Transfer: Data send and receive operations run in a background thread, keeping the scheduler’s event loop uninterrupted.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RDMA-Based Transfer: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) leverages queue pairs for connections and scatter-gather elements (SGE) for efficient transfer of non-contiguous memory chunks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexible API Integration: SGLang offers adaptable APIs that integrate high-performance RDMA libraries like Mooncake and NIXL, streamlining data transfers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More details can be found in our design document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Large-scale Expert Parallelism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Expert Parallelism with DeepEP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepEP, implemented by the DeepSeek team, is a communication library designed to streamline EP in MoE models. It tackles the challenge of efficiently routing tokens to specific experts across multiple GPUs. By providing optimized communication kernels, DeepEP reduces latency and boosts throughput, making it ideal for large-scale inference tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepEP provides two specialized dispatch modes to address varying workload demands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Normal Dispatch: Optimized for handling long input sequences, such as during the prefill phase, this mode prioritizes maximum computational throughput. However, it generates symbolic shapes that are incompatible with CUDA Graph, rendering it less effective for the decode phase, where kernel launch overhead becomes a significant bottleneck.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low-Latency Dispatch: Tailored for generating output tokens during the decode phase, this mode prioritizes minimal delay to ensure real-time performance. It supports CUDA Graph but requires preallocating a fixed memory size. If the memory demand exceeds this preallocation, a runtime error occurs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In SGLang, the integration of DeepEP provides auto mode that dynamically selects between these two dispatch modes based on the workload. However, without PD disaggregation, the auto mode faces a limitation: it cannot simultaneously support both normal dispatch (for prefill) and low-latency dispatch (for decode) within the same communication group. This restriction hinders its compatibility with DP attention, which is crucial for memory-efficient inference. The compatibility of each mode is outlined in the table below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mode&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Long Input&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Long Output&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;DP Attention&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;CUDA Graph&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Normal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Low-Latency&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Auto&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PD disaggregation addresses this by separating prefill and decode phases, allowing normal dispatch for the prefill phase and low-latency dispatch for the decode phase, both under DP attention. This integration optimizes resource utilization and enhances overall performance by aligning the dispatch mode with the specific needs of each phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;DeepGEMM Integration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepGEMM is another high-efficient library developed by the DeepSeek team, specifically designed to optimize computations in MoE models. It provides two specialized functions for handling MoE-related matrix multiplications (Grouped GEMMs), each tailored to different phases of the inference process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout): This kernel is designed for dynamic input shapes, making it ideal for the prefill phase of MoE inference. It processes inputs where the data for different experts is concatenated contiguously, allowing for flexible handling of varying input sizes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grouped GEMMs (masked layout): This kernel assumes a fixed input shape and uses a mask tensor to compute only the valid portions of the input. It is compatible with CUDA Graph, which optimizes kernel launches, making it well-suited for the decode phase where reducing overhead is critical.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepGEMM integrates smoothly with the dispatch modes of DeepEP:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For the contiguous layout kernel, which is used with normal dispatch in the prefill phase, an additional step is required. Since normal dispatch outputs a symbolic shape, a permutation is needed to transform the output into the contiguous format expected by the kernel. We referred to the LightLLM project and implemented a custom Triton kernel for efficient permutation. This kernel ensures that the output from normal dispatch is correctly rearranged, enabling smooth integration with the contiguous GEMM kernel.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The masked layout kernel pairs seamlessly with DeepEP’s low-latency dispatch, as both are optimized for the decode phase and support CUDA Graph.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SGLang also integrates DeepGEMM for MoE computation under tensor parallelism. Additionally, DeepGEMM provides a highly efficient general GeMM kernel, which can be activated in SGLang by setting the environment variable &lt;code&gt;SGL_ENABLE_JIT_DEEPGEMM&lt;/code&gt; to 1, offering even greater computational efficiency for non-MoE operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Two-batch Overlap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In multi-node environments, limited communication bandwidth can significantly increase overall latency. To tackle this challenge, we implemented Two-batch Overlap (TBO) following DeepSeek's system design. TBO splits a single batch into two micro-batches, allowing computation and communication to overlap, which also lowers peak memory usage by halving the effective batch size. However, putting TBO into practice introduces specific implementation difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Implementation Challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although DeepSeek released the design framework of TBO, there are two slight implementation challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code Complexity: Directly coding TBO can lead to duplicated logic for managing multiple micro-batches. This increases the complexity of the codebase, making it harder to maintain and prone to errors, especially as the number of micro-batches or overlapping scenarios grows.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Synchronization Issues in the Prefill Phase: Achieving effective overlap between computation and communication needs consideration when the normal dispatch in DeepEP block the CPU. This blocking behavior can stall the pipeline, leaving the GPU idle and undermining the performance benefits of TBO.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Abstraction for Clean Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a more maintainable and reusable codebase, we use an abstraction layer consisting of operations and yield points. This method simplifies development by allowing us to write code as if handling a single micro-batch, while strategically pausing execution by inserting yield points to let other micro-batches proceed. It eliminates code duplication, reduces the potential need for variable postfixes, and efficiently manages cases where some executions complete at a layer's end while others have not. Additionally, it supports easy adaptation to different overlapping region choices or future enhancements, like a three-batch overlap, with minimal code changes. Below is a concise demonstration of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operations = [
    self._forward_attn,
    YieldOperation(),  # Pause execution for other micro-batches
    self._forward_dispatch,
    self._forward_mlp,
    YieldOperation(),  # Another pause point
    self._forward_combine,
]

# Process a single micro-batch without duplicating code
def _forward_attn(self, state):
    state.hidden_states = self.self_attn(state.hidden_states, ...)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Prefill Overlapping Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We refine the launch order during the prefill phase to avoid CPU-blocking via the dispatch operation in DeepEP, even though we are using its asynchronous mode. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The dispatch operation blocks the CPU until the GPU receives metadata from other ranks to allocate correctly sized tensors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An improper implementation would leave the computation stream idle during this period, as no computation tasks are submitted to the GPU.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To optimize, we prioritize submitting computation tasks to the GPU before launching CPU-blocking communication. This ensures the GPU remains active during communication. As illustrated in the figure below, TBO with a proper launch order, indicated by bolded borders, avoids bubble caused by a CPU-blocking operation (i.e., normal dispatch).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Expert Parallelism Load Balancer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In MoE models, EP often leads to uneven workload distribution across GPUs. This imbalance forces the system to wait for the slowest GPU computation or communication, wasting compute cycles and increasing memory usage due to expert activations. As the number of GPUs (EP size) increases, the imbalance issue gets more severe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this, DeepSeek developed the Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB). EPLB takes expert distribution statistics as input and computes an optimal arrangement of experts to minimize imbalance. Users can allocate redundant experts (e.g., 32 additional experts), which, when combined with the original 256, create a pool of 288 experts. This pool allows EPLB to strategically place or replicate experts—for instance, duplicating the most frequently used expert multiple times or grouping a moderately used expert with rarely used ones on a single GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond balancing workloads, EPLB offers greater flexibility in parallelism design. With the original 256 experts, parallelism sizes are restricted to powers of two. EPLB’s use of 288 experts enables more diverse configurations, such as parallelism sizes of 12 or 72.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the figure below, we demonstrate the effects of scale and EPLB algorithm to the imbalance issue via simulation. We compute GPU balancedness as the ratio between mean computation time and maximum computation time for a MoE layer among GPUs, and we use the number of tokens for a GPU to estimate the computation time for it. As can be seen, utilization rate decreases when the system scales with the number of nodes, and enabling EPLB significantly improves the utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;EPLB for Real-World Serving&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For EPLB to be effective, the input distribution must closely match the actual serving workload. Two strategies enhance this alignment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Increasing Batch Size: Larger batches reduce random fluctuations in expert usage, which improves balance, which can be achieved by scaling the cluster or using techniques like Multi-Token Prediction (MTP).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Periodic Rebalancing: Regularly updating the expert arrangement leverages temporal locality but requires efficient reloading of experts. This necessitates minimizing the cost of expert reloading operations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with EPLB, some imbalance is inevitable, making further optimization a valuable future direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Implementation of Rebalancing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SGLang implements expert rebalancing in three stages to ensure efficiency and minimal disruption:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System Loading Stage: Weights are optionally preloaded from disk to main memory for faster rebalancing or kept on disk with memory mapping (mmap) for reduced memory usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rebalance Preparation Stage: Required weights are asynchronously transferred to device memory in the background, utilizing free DMA hardware engines without interrupting ongoing GPU operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rebalance Execution Stage: A device-to-device copy updates the weights. This step can be further optimized through physical memory rebinding techniques.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This staged approach ensures that rebalancing is both efficient and non-disruptive, maintaining system performance during updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;End-to-end Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Experimental Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the end-to-end performance of different configurations of SGLang using DeepSeek-V3 on a cluster of 12 nodes, connected via InfiniBand and each equipped with 8 H100 GPUs. This evaluation highlights the throughput improvements enabled by our advanced optimization techniques. We compared the following four settings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SGLang with TP16 x 6: Every two nodes are paired with an independent group, running DeepSeek-V3 inference with a TP size of 16 and DP attention.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SGLang with PD Disaggregation: This version incorporates PD disaggregation and full EP optimization. For the EPLB, we adopt a distribution matching the input/output data, as real-time serving statistics are unavailable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SGLang with PD Disaggregation and simulated MTP: To simulate MTP’s effects, we firstly double the batch size and halve the Key-Value KV cache length to maintain the same workload for GroupedGeMM computation and memory access. Moreover, we insert dummy kernels after the real attention computation to ensure the attention phase takes the same time as in DeepSeek’s profile, accurately reflecting the slowdown caused by MTP’s attention mechanism. We conservatively assume a 70% acceptance rate under MTP.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DeepSeek Profile Results: Throughput estimates are derived from DeepSeek’s official profiling data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Performance Analysis of Prefill and Decode Phases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To accommodate varying workload demands, we independently evaluated the prefill (P) and decode (D) phases, assuming unlimited resources for the non-tested phase to isolate and maximize the load on the tested nodes—mirroring the setup used by DeepSeek. The results are summarized below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefill Phase: On 4 nodes (4×8×H100, EP32), the system achieved per-node throughputs of 57,674, 54,543, and 50,302 tokens per second for prompt lengths of 1K, 2K, and 4K, respectively. As shown in the bar chart below, this represents up to a 3.3× improvement over the TP16 baseline, largely attributable to the optimized GroupedGeMM kernel (DeepGEMM) and two-batch overlap. Assuming a perfectly balanced workload, our system’s throughput is within 5.6% of DeepSeek's official profile.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decode Phase: Evaluated on 9 nodes (9×8×H100, EP72; half the scale of DeepSeek), the system achieved 22,282 tokens/sec per node for 2K inputs—representing a 5.2× speedup over the TP16 baseline. Under simulated MTP conditions—with attention kernels intentionally slowed to reflect real-world latency—the system sustained a high throughput of 17,373 tokens/sec per node for 4K inputs, just 6.6% below DeepSeek’s official profile. As shown in the figure on the right, these performance gains are largely attributed to 4× larger batch sizes enabled by EP, which enhances scalability by significantly reducing per-GPU memory consumption of model weights.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Profile Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section compares SGLang’s performance with DeepSeek’s inference system, aligning our experimental setup as closely as possible to DeepSeek’s production environment. We analyze overall throughput and detailed kernel breakdowns, benchmarking against DeepSeek’s blog and public profile data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Overall Throughput&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For prefill, we tested a scenario with 16,384 tokens per device and an input length of 4,096. Due to uncertainty in DeepSeek’s expert distribution, we evaluated two cases: one with default expert distribution and another with simulated perfect EPLB (random expert selection following group-limited routing semantics) as a performance upper bound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are presented below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;N/A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16,384&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16,384&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16,384&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Input Length&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N/A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,096&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,096&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,096&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Throughput (per node)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;32,206&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;62,713&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;50,302&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;59,337&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s profile reports a throughput roughly twice that of its production environment. SGLang with default expert imbalance is 20% slower than DeepSeek’s profile, while the simulated perfect EPLB case narrows the gap to 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decode, the results are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;22,282&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17,373&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using half the nodes of DeepSeek, SGLang with simulated MTP is only slightly slower than DeepSeek’s profile. In a higher batch size setting (256 sequences, 2,000 input length), SGLang achieves 22,282 tokens per second per node, demonstrating strong scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Detail Breakdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The figure below breaks down kernel execution times for prefill, including unit test results as a theoretical upper bound:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Default EPLB: Communication kernels exhibit longer execution times and higher variance compared to DeepSeek’s profile, likely due to greater expert imbalance. This leads to extended computation stream bubbles, slowing down overall performance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simulated Perfect EPLB: This setup aligns more closely with DeepSeek’s profile, though discrepancies remain, indicating potential areas for optimization.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Comparison with Unit Tests: Both DeepSeek and SGLang have a communication time slower than unit test results, while the latter is achievable when disabling TBO, revealing a potential optimization direction if communication is the bottleneck.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SGLang’s decode kernel breakdown aligns closely with DeepSeek’s, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key observations include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combine Time Discrepancy: SGLang’s combine operation appears 2x slower than DeepSeek’s due to shorter attention computation, causing communication kernels to busy-wait. In the simulated slow attention experiment, combine time matches DeepSeek’s, confirming this hypothesis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MoE Performance: SGLang’s MoE kernels are 25% slower, possibly because DeepSeek’s 18 nodes (versus our 9) distribute experts more efficiently, reducing memory access overhead for GEMM operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dispatch Optimization Potential: Both DeepSeek and SGLang show dispatch times of ~0.17ms per layer, but unit tests with DeepEP reveal a potential of 0.06ms occupying SMs. Currently, dispatch spends significant time busy-waiting for data. Inserting slow dummy kernels between send/receive operations reduces dispatch time to 0.09ms, and in-flight duration analysis using unit test data suggests further improvements are possible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While minor enhancements remain—primarily in kernel fusion under "Other Kernels"—SGLang’s decode performance is largely aligned with DeepSeek’s, with prefill optimization as the next focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ablation Study: Two-batch Overlap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Impact of Batch Size and Attention Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section investigates TBO performance across varying batch sizes and simulated MTP scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TBO delivers two significant benefits in the prefill phase, as evidenced by throughput comparisons and memory usage optimizations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for Larger Batch Sizes: In the vanilla configuration, each device processes up to 8,192 tokens before encountering out-of-memory (OOM) errors at 16,384 tokens. TBO mitigates this by optimizing memory usage for input tokens, enabling inference with batches as large as 16,384 tokens per device. This further boosts performance to 40.5% increase when comparing the TBO flag with all other configurations made optimal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enhanced Throughput: By overlapping computation (e.g., attention and MLP phases) with communication (e.g., DeepEP Combine and Dispatch), TBO achieves a 27% to 35% throughput increase compared to the vanilla setup, even when processing the same token count per device.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TBO’s impact in the decode phase varies by scenario, with performance tied to batch size and attention processing time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real Test Cases: Speedup in practical scenarios is contingent on batch size exceeding a threshold between 64 and 128 tokens. Below this, TBO yields minimal or negative gains (e.g., -27% at 32 tokens/device), as small decode batch sizes hinder kernel efficiency. The speedup reaches 25.5% at 256 tokens with a performance of 22,310 tokens per second.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simulated MTP Scenario: TBO provides the most substantial speedup in simulated MTP cases when processing 128 requests to generate 256 tokens per decode step. This is due to prolonged attention processing time, which aligns computation (e.g., DP Attention layers) with DeepEP communication overhead (e.g., combine and dispatch steps). The evaluation shows a 35% speedup at 128 sequences/device, with throughput 17,552 tokens per second compared to 12,929 without TBO.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Detail Breakdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated three prefill scenarios: TBO with 16k tokens per batch, TBO with 8k tokens, and no-TBO with 8k tokens. The figure below reveals key insights:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TBO Efficiency: Comparing the 8k cases, TBO improves overall efficiency by overlapping computation and communication, as expected.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Batch Size Impact: Reducing the batch size from 16k to 8k with TBO results in a slight slowdown, reflecting diminished kernel efficiency with smaller batches.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kernel Performance: Interestingly, the no-TBO 8k case outperforms the TBO 16k case in per-kernel speed, despite both having an effective batch size of 8k for kernels. This may stem from reduced streaming multiprocessors (SMs) with TBO, potential noisy neighbor effects during overlap, or kernel incompatibility between computation and communication. These findings suggest future optimization directions for SGLang.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the decode phase, we analyzed three configurations: TBO with a batch size of 256, no-TBO with 256, and no-TBO with 128. The time breakdown is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TBO vs. No-TBO (Batch Size 256): Without TBO, communication time increases significantly due to the lack of overlap. However, computation kernels, particularly GEMM, benefit from a larger effective batch size, resulting in faster execution.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TBO (256) vs. No-TBO (128): Comparing cases with the same kernel batch size, only non-overlapped communication slows down in the no-TBO setup, while computation remains consistent. Unlike prefill, decode communication kernels either fully utilize SMs (during send/receive) or none (during inflight waiting), avoiding resource contention with computation kernels.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ablation Study: EPLB&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section evaluates the impact of the EPLB on system performance through overall throughput analysis and detailed case studies. Given EPLB's sensitivity to workload distribution and distribution shifts in production environments, we focus on qualitative and generalizable insights rather than real-world performance, which requires production data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Overall Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The figure below illustrates EPLB's effect on throughput in large-scale settings. EPLB delivers a significant speedup of 1.49x (prefill) and 2.54x (decode), as expected, due to its ability to mitigate workload imbalances across GPUs. As the number of ranks scales, imbalances grow, and EPLB effectively addresses this in our large-scale experiments, leading to notable throughput improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Case Study: Workload Imbalance Versus Overall Throughput&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explore the relationship between workload imbalance and throughput, we conducted a case study using a decode experiment with 1800 input tokens, 100 output tokens, and a batch size of 256. Throughput and balancedness (average token count divided by maximum token count across experts) were plotted against decoding steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results reveal a strong correlation between balancedness and throughput, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high balancedness for optimal performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Case Study: Expert Distribution Statistics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following figure presents expert distribution statistics for prefill and decode sample data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key observations include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Imbalance in Expert Usage: Most experts are infrequently used, while a small subset is heavily utilized, underscoring the inherent imbalance in MoE models.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefill vs. Decode Differences: Although prefill and decode distributions share similarities, notable differences exist. This supports the use of PD disaggregation, which enables distinct expert placements for each phase, optimizing performance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These findings highlight EPLB's role in addressing workload imbalances and the value of tailoring expert placement to phase-specific demands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Toolkits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Disposable Tensor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory management in PyTorch can be challenging due to persistent object references, especially in GPU-intensive workflows where CUDA memory is a scarce resource. Consider the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def ffn(hidden_state: torch.Tensor, linear1: nn.Linear, linear2: nn.Linear):
    intermediate_state = linear1(hidden_state)
    del hidden_state  # Attempt to free memory, but no effect due to external reference
    return linear2(nn.ReLU(intermediate_state))

hidden_state = ffn(hidden_state, linear1, linear2)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this code, &lt;code&gt;del hidden_state&lt;/code&gt; is intended to release the memory occupied by &lt;code&gt;hidden_state&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;intermediate_state&lt;/code&gt; is computed. However, as &lt;code&gt;hidden_state&lt;/code&gt; is still referenced outside the function, the &lt;code&gt;del&lt;/code&gt; operation has no effect. This increases peak memory usage, risking performance slowdowns or out-of-memory errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SGLang addresses this with the DisposableTensor class, a subclass of &lt;code&gt;torch.Tensor&lt;/code&gt; which introduces a dispose() method to explicitly and immediately release a tensor’s memory, circumventing Python’s reference counting limitations. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def ffn(hidden_state: torch.Tensor, linear1: nn.Linear, linear2: nn.Linear):
    intermediate_state = linear1(hidden_state)
    hidden_state.dispose()  # Immediately releases CUDA memory
    return linear2(nn.ReLU(intermediate_state))

# Wrap the tensor in DisposableTensor
hidden_state = DisposableTensor(hidden_state)
hidden_state = ffn(hidden_state, linear1, linear2)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By wrapping &lt;code&gt;hidden_state&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;DisposableTensor&lt;/code&gt; and calling &lt;code&gt;dispose()&lt;/code&gt; when it’s no longer needed, the CUDA memory is freed right away. This ensures that memory is released as soon as the tensor’s role in the computation is complete, reducing peak memory usage and improving overall efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Expert Workload Extraction and Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SGLang also includes a toolset for analyzing and simulating expert workload distribution in MoE models. This feature enables users to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dump Expert Workload Statistics: Extract either accumulated statistics or per-batch workload data. Accumulated stats support the EPLB manager for real-time optimization, while per-batch data provides granular insights for analysis and simulation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simulate Expert Utilization: Model expert balance across various configurations without requiring costly hardware or repeated trials. For instance, users can gather workload data from a modest setup (e.g., 2x8xH100 or 8xH200) and simulate the performance for a large-scale 22-node deployment.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This simulation capability allows users to evaluate how factors like rebalancing frequency, node count, or batch size impact system performance. It’s a cost-effective way to fine-tune configurations before scaling up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Limitations and Future Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While our implementation of SGLang for DeepSeek-V3 inference demonstrates significant throughput improvements, several limitations and areas for future enhancement remain:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Latency Optimization: The current focus on throughput leaves Time to First Token (TTFT) at 2–5 seconds and Inter-Token Latency (ITL) at approximately 100ms, requiring further optimizations for real-time use cases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sequence Length Constraints: Limited to shorter sequences due to the use of 96 GPUs. Expanding GPU resources would support longer sequences, essential for specific applications.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Integration: SGLang supports MTP but lacks full integration with DP attention, reducing efficiency in mixed parallelism configurations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EPLB Distribution: The experiments in this blog utilizes in-distribution data for Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB), which may not reflect real-world variability. Future work should experiment performances when having distribution shifts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexible Tensor Parallelism (TP) Sizes: For DeepSeek-V3, memory-optimal TP sizes for dense FFNs are small but larger than 1. Currently, SGLang only supports pure TP or DP, leading to suboptimal memory use. Flexible TP options are needed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Blackwell Support: Currently, our implementation supports only the NVIDIA Hopper architecture. We are actively working to extend compatibility to the next-generation Blackwell architecture. If you are interested in supporting or sponsoring this development, welcome to contact lmsys.org@gmail.com.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By leveraging PD disaggregation, EP, and a carefully crafted parallelism design, we’ve reproduced DeepSeek’s inference framework in SGLang with exceptional performance. Our open-source efforts—achieving 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second—demonstrate SGLang’s power for large-scale LLM inference. We invite the community to explore, replicate, and extend this work to push the boundaries of efficient AI deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;From AI Darling to Disinformation Playbook: How Fake Accounts Managed a Market Frenzy and What DeepSeek’s Hype Teaches Leaders&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek, a new Chinese AI model, stormed app charts and briefly sent shockwaves through global markets. However, our disinformation research team found that much of this excitement was artificial — driven by thousands of fake profiles working in tandem. Their behavior bore the hallmarks of state-linked bot networks, amplifying hype and distorting market perception. For tech leaders and investors, the warning is clear: without the ability to separate genuine adoption from manufactured buzz, decisions risk being guided by disinformation rather than reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What happened with the DeepSeek launch?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: DeepSeek’s record-breaking hype wasn’t organic — it was powered by thousands of coordinated fake accounts. #what-happened&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our disinformation research team analysed 41,864 profiles discussing DeepSeek.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;3,388 were fake accounts — about 15% of all engagement, double the usual baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These accounts generated 2,158 posts in a single day, reaching their peak activity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The orchestrated amplification made DeepSeek trend across platforms and influence market narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How did fake accounts manufacture excitement and drive disinformation around DeepSeek?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: They acted in sync, boosting each other and hijacking authentic conversations to create an illusion of momentum. #how-manufactured&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mutual amplification: Fake profiles commented and liked each other’s posts to simulate popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Piggybacking on trending posts: They flooded viral tweets (e.g., @FanTV_official, 480K+ views) with DeepSeek praise.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Integration with real users: Bots joined genuine conversations, tricking users into engaging with disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Synchronized timing: Bursts of identical content at the same moment maximised visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What are the hallmarks of a coordinated bot network?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Recent creation dates, avatar recycling, identical posts, and synchronous activity are tell-tale signs. #criteria&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Avatar recycling: Many used generic stock photos, often of Chinese women.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Recent creation: 44.7% of accounts were created in 2024, coinciding with DeepSeek’s rise.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Copy-pasting: Identical praise-filled comments posted en masse.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Simultaneous posting: Coordinated bursts created artificial virality.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So what: These patterns match known behaviour of Chinese bot networks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why does manufactured hype matter for markets and brands?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Artificial excitement can sway investment, distort perception, and mislead decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Market impact: DeepSeek’s hype briefly moved US markets, wiping out billions in valuation as investors scrambled.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reputation distortion: Fake sentiment shaped the AI arms-race narrative in China’s favour.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Precedent: Similar tactics have been used to influence elections and protests — now redirected toward tech adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Risk: Investors, boards, and communications teams risk making strategic decisions based on false signals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Build vs. Buy: Can teams monitor this themselves?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Building internal detection is impractical; specialised tools are faster, broader, and more reliable. #build-vs-buy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Build: Requires data pipelines across platforms, AI expertise, and 24/7 monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Buy: Platforms like ours are pre-trained to identify fake accounts, coordinated behaviour, and narrative manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Time to value: Tools deliver insights in hours vs. months.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cost of delay: One misinformation-fuelled hype cycle can move billions before teams react.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How should organisations roll out disinformation detection in 90 days?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Start with monitoring, then stress-test with simulations, and embed playbooks for rapid response. #rollout&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0–30 days: Connect monitoring dashboards to social platforms; set thresholds for unusual spikes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;31–60 days: Run simulations of bot-driven hype or backlash; align comms and risk teams.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;61–90 days: Develop and codify playbooks for investor messaging, market communications, and board reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Roles: Comms &amp;amp; IR (messaging), Strategy (risk), Insights/Research (detection).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is all AI hype fake? No — but fake accounts can amplify genuine interest.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How many fakes are “normal”? Typically 5–7%; DeepSeek hit 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Which platforms are most exploited? X and TikTok, due to virality and weaker controls.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Are state actors always involved? Not always — but DeepSeek’s patterns matched Chinese bot networks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Can small firms be targeted too? Yes — hype tactics are cheap to deploy at any scale.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Do detection tools replace analysts? No — they augment analysts with faster, deeper signals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Methods &amp;amp; Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Source: Our disinformation research team analyzed 41,864 profiles discussing DeepSeek between January 21 and February 4.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Findings: Identified 3,388 fakes (15%) showing hallmarks of coordinated bot networks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Approach: Sentiment analysis, network mapping, and account authenticity scoring.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TODO: evidence needed — proposed investor survey on how hype narratives influence decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Taco Bell rethinks AI drive-through after man orders 18,000 waters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taco Bell is rethinking its use of artificial intelligence (AI) to power drive-through restaurants in the US after comical videos of the tech making mistakes were viewed millions of times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one clip, a customer seemingly crashed the system by ordering 18,000 water cups, while in another a person got increasingly angry as the AI repeatedly asked him to add more drinks to his order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 2023, the fast-food chain has introduced the technology at over 500 locations in the US, with the aim of reducing mistakes and speeding up orders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the AI seems to have served up the complete opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taco Bell's Chief Digital and Technology Officer Dane Mathews told The Wall Street Journal that deploying the voice AI has had its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes it lets me down, but sometimes it really surprises me," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said the firm was "learning a lot" - but he would now think carefully about where to use AI going forwards, including not using it at drive-throughs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular, Mr Matthews said, there are times when humans are better placed to take orders, especially when the restaurants get busy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We'll help coach teams on when to use voice AI and when it's better to monitor or step in," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issues have been building online as disgruntled customers take to social media to complain about the service - with many pointing out glitches and issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One clip on Instagram, which has been viewed over 21.5 million times, shows a man ordering "a large Mountain Dew" and the AI voice continually replying "and what will you drink with that?".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It isn't the first time there has been issues with AI not getting it right when it comes to processing food and drink orders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year McDonald's withdrew AI from its own drive-throughs as the tech misinterpreted customer orders - resulting in one person getting bacon added to their ice cream in error, and another having hundreds of dollars worth of chicken nuggets mistakenly added to their order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But despite some of the viral glitches facing Taco Bell, it says two million orders have been successfully processed using the voice AI since its introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
