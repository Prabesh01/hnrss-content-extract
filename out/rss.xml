  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Glide, an extensible, keyboard-focused web browser&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Glide is a Firefox fork with a TypeScript config that lets you build anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;invisible-heading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download - Docs - Cookbook - Source&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browsers should be hackable, just like your editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;glide.keymaps.set("normal", "gC", async () =&amp;gt; {
  // extract the owner and repo from a url like 'https://github.com/glide-browser/glide'
  const [owner, repo] = glide.ctx.url.pathname.split("/").slice(1, 3);
  if (!owner || !repo) throw new Error("current URL is not a github repo");

  // * clone the current github repo to ~/github.com/$owner/$repo
  // * start kitty with neovim open at the cloned repo
  const repo_path = glide.path.join(glide.path.home_dir, "github.com", owner, repo);
  await glide.process.execute("gh", ["repo", "clone", glide.ctx.url, repo_path]);
  await glide.process.execute("kitty", ["-d", repo_path, "nvim"], { cwd: repo_path });
}, { description: "open the GitHub repo in the focused tab in Neovim" });
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Glide keymapping to clone the GitHub repo in the current tab and open it in kitty + neovim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my job, I have to clone many different repos. This keymapping saves me a couple seconds each time, multiple times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although it probably doesn't save me much time, adding this mapping only took a couple of minutes and using it makes me happy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why I built Glide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was using tridactyl within Firefox and generally enjoying it, but occasionally I would run into frustrating issues due to security constraints imposed by Firefox on web extensions. For example, extensions are completely disabled on addons.mozilla.org, so all of my mappings could break depending on the website I had open. Additionally, tridactyl wouldn't work with a custom homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These security constraints imposed on tridactyl, and every other extension, are fundamental to how extensions operate. For example, it would be very bad if an extension could prevent itself from being uninstalled by modifying addons.mozilla.org, so browsers have to protect users from potentially malicious extension writers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, I realised there was an opportunity to make a browser that's truly customisable at its core, with no restrictions on what you can accomplish. From customising the browser UI itself, to calling out to other tools—anything should be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Glide is different&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glide holistically solves these usability issues by supporting a TypeScript config that lets you do anything1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glide can support APIs and functionality that will never be supported in web extensions as the security model is fundamentally different. You—the end user—are responsible for the config, so there's no reason to restrict what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Glide config you can define custom key mappings, access the web extensions API, spawn arbitrary processes, define macros, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a small example that adds g+c as a key mapping to switch to the calendar tab:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// ~/.config/glide/glide.ts
glide.keymaps.set("normal", "gc", async () =&amp;gt; {
  const tab = await glide.tabs.get_first({ url: "https://calendar.google.com/*" });
  assert(tab &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tab.id);
  await browser.tabs.update(tab.id, { active: true });
}, { description: "[g]o to [c]alendar.google.com" });
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more examples, see the cookbook or my own dotfiles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cherry on top is that all of this is built on top of Firefox. If you already use Firefox, then your existing extensions and workflows will still work in Glide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Modes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glide borrows the concept of modes from (neo)vim; every key mapping you define will be attached to a specific mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glide switches between modes automatically when you interact with the browser. For example, in the default mode, &lt;code&gt;normal&lt;/code&gt;, if you click on an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, Glide will switch to &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; mode, so that key mappings don't interfere with entering text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a website doesn't play well with your key mappings you can switch to &lt;code&gt;ignore&lt;/code&gt; mode by pressing Shift+Escape, in this mode the only default key mapping is Shift+Escape to exit ignore mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Navigating&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glide supports a &lt;code&gt;hint&lt;/code&gt; mode that lets you operate web pages entirely using the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; to enter &lt;code&gt;hint&lt;/code&gt; mode and Glide will overlay text labels over every hintable element, e.g. links and buttons. Typing the label for a hint will then focus and click the element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Personal favourite features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;gI&lt;/code&gt;focuses the largest visible input element on the page and it feels like magic every time I use it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;space&amp;gt;&amp;lt;space&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;opens a tab fuzzy finder, which is invaluable for finding that one tab you always lose.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;c-i&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;c-o&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;are also invaluable for navigating previously open tabs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;:repl&lt;/code&gt;for quickly testing out config changes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;hints for when I don't want to reach for my mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A which-key inspired UI for reminding you of the many key mappings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been daily driving Glide for ~6 months now and while I'm biased, I love it. It's still in a very early alpha stage but if you'd like to try it out, you can download it for macOS / Linux today. I'd recommend checking out the tutorial with &lt;code&gt;:tutor&lt;/code&gt; to get your bearings, although it's far from complete yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;p.s. sorry Linux folks, Glide isn't in any package repositories yet, so you'll have to untar it and set up Glide manually for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Glide is in very early alpha there are missing APIs so you can't literally do everything yet, but enabling full control is one of the main goals.↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noah Brier, September 30, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've talked to me lately about AI, you've almost certainly been subject to a long soliloquy about the wonders of Claude Code. What started as a tool I ran in parallel with other tools to aid coding has turned into my full-fledged agentic operating system, supporting all kinds of workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most notably, Obsidian, the tool I use for note-taking. The difference between Obsidian and Notion or Evernote is that all the files are just plain old Markdown files stored on your computer. You can sync, style, and save them, but ultimately, it's still a text file on your hard drive. A few months ago, I realized that this fact made my Obsidian notes and research a particularly interesting target for AI coding tools. What first started with trying to open my vault in Cursor quickly moved to a sort of note-taking operating system that I grew so reliant on, I ended up standing up a server in my house so I could connect via SSH from my phone into my Claude Code + Obsidian setup and take notes, read notes, and think through things on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I went on Dan Shipper's AI &amp;amp; I Podcast to wax poetic about my love for this setup. I did a pretty deep dive into the system I use, how it works, why it works, etc. I won't retread all those details—you can read the transcript or listen to the podcast—but I want to talk about a few other things related to Claude Code that I've come to realize since the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've really struggled to answer this question. I'm also not sure it's better than Cursor for all things, but I do think there are a set of fairly exceptional pieces that work together in concert to make me turn to Claude Code whenever I need to build anything these days. Increasingly, that's not even about applying it to existing codebases as much as it's building entirely new things on top of its functionality (more on that in a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what's the secret? Part of it lies in how Claude Code approaches tools. As a terminal-based application, it trades accessibility for something powerful: native Unix command integration. While I typically avoid long blockquotes, the Unix Philosophy deserves an exception—Doug McIlroy's original formulation captures it perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Unix philosophy is documented by Doug McIlroy in the Bell System Technical Journal from 1978:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was later summarized by Peter H. Salus in A Quarter-Century of Unix (1994):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These fifty-year-old principles are exactly how LLMs want to use tools. If you look at how these models actually use the tools they're given, they are constantly "piping" output to input (albeit using their own fuzziness in between). (As an aside, the Unix | command allows you to string the output from one command into the input of another.) When models fail to weld their tools effectively, it is almost always because the tools are overly complex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So part one of why Claude Code can be so mind-blowing is that the commands that power Unix happen to be perfectly suited for use by LLMs. This is both because they're simple and also incredibly well-documented, meaning the models had ample source material to teach them the literal ins and outs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that still wasn't the whole thing. The other piece was obviously Claude Code's ability to write code initially and, more recently, prose (for me, at least). But while other applications like ChatGPT and Claude can write output, there was something different going on here. Last week, while reading The Pragmatic Engineer's deep dive into how Claude Code is built. The answer was staring me in the face: filesystem access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The filesystem changes everything. ChatGPT and Claude in the browser have two fatal flaws: no memory between conversations and a cramped context window. A filesystem solves both. Claude Code writes notes to itself, accumulates knowledge, and keeps running tallies. It has state and memory. It can think beyond a single conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2022, when I first played with the GPT-3 API, I said that even if models never got better than they were in that moment, we would still have a decade to discover the use cases. They did get better—reasoning models made tool calling reliable—but the filesystem discovery proves my point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bring this up because in the Pragmatic Engineer interview, Boris Cherney, who built the initial version of Claude Code, uses it to describe the aha:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In AI, we talk about “product overhang”, and this is what we discovered with the prototype. Product overhang means that a model is able to do a specific thing, but the product that the AI runs in isn’t built in a way that captures this capability. What I discovered about Claude exploring the filesystem was pure product overhang. The model could already do this, but there wasn’t a product built around this capability!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, I'd argue it's filesystem + Unix commands, but the point is that the capability was there in the model just waiting to be woken up, and once it was, we were off to the races. Claude Code works as a blueprint for building reliable agentic systems because it captures model capabilities instead of limiting them through over-engineered interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I talked about my Claude Code + Obsidian setup, and I've actually taken it a step further by open-sourcing "Claudesidian," which pulls in a bunch of the tools and commands I use in my own Claude Code + Obsidian setup. It also goes beyond that and was a fun experimental ground for me. Most notably, I built an initial upgrade tool so that if changes are made centrally, you can pull them into your own Claudesidian, and the AI will help you check to see if you've made changes to the files being updated and, if so, attempt to smartly merge your changes with the new updates. Both projects follow the same Unix philosophy principles—simple, composable tools that do one thing well and work together. This is the kind of stuff that Claude Code makes possible, and why it's so exciting for me as a new way of building applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, one I'm not quite ready to release, but hopefully will be soon, is something I've been calling "Inbox Magic," though I'll surely come up with a better name. It's a Claude Code repo with access to a set of Gmail tools and a whole bunch of prompts and commands to effectively start operating like your own email EA. Right now, the functionality is fairly simple: it can obviously run searches or send emails on your behalf, but it can also do things like triage and actually run a whole training run on how you sound over email so it can more effectively draft emails for you. While Claude Code and ChatGPT both have access to my emails, they mostly grab one or two at a time. This system, because it can write things out to files and do lots of other fancy tricks, can perform a task like “find every single travel-related email in my inbox and use that to build a profile of my travel habits that I can use as a prompt to help ChatGPT/Claude do travel research that's actually aligned with my preferences.” Anyway, more on this soon, and if it's something you want to try out, ping me with your GitHub username, and as soon as I feel like I have something ready to test, I'll happily share it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I generally shy away from conclusions, I think there are a few here worth reiterating.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a storage cluster in downtown SF to store 90 million hours worth of video data. Why? We’re pretraining models to solve computer use. Compared to text LLMs like LLaMa-405B, which require ~60 TB of text data to train, videos are sufficiently large that we need 500 times more storage. Instead of paying the $12 million / yr it would cost to store all of this on AWS, we rented space from a colocation center in San Francisco to bring that cost down ~40x to $354k per year, including depreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our use case for data is unique. Most cloud providers care highly about redundancy, availability, and data integrity, which tends to be unnecessary for ML training data. Since pretraining data is a commodity—we can lose any individual 5% with minimal impact—we can handle relatively large amounts of data corruption compared to enterprises who need guarantees that their user data isn’t going anywhere. In other words, we don’t need AWS’s 13 nines of reliability; 2 is more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, storage tends to be priced substantially above cost. Most companies use relatively small amounts of storage (even ones like Discord still use under a petabyte for messages), and the companies that use petabytes are so large that storage remains a tiny fraction of their total compute spend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data is one of our biggest contraints, and would be prohibitively expensive otherwise. As long as the cost predictions work out in favor of a local datacenter, and it would not consume too much of the core team’s time, it would make sense to stack hard drives ourselves. [1] 1. We talked to some engineers at the Internet Archive, which had basically the same problem as us; even after massive friends &amp;amp; family discounts on AWS, it was still 10 times more cost-effective to buy racks and store the data themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Cost Breakdown: Cloud Alternatives vs In-House&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internet and electricity total $17.5k as our only recurring expenses (the price of colocation space, cooling, etc were bundled into electricity costs). One-time costs were dominated by hard drive capex. [2] 2. When deciding the datacenter location we had multiple options across the Bay Area, including options in Fremont through Hurricane Electric for around $10k in setup fees and $12.8k per month, saving us $38.5k initially and $4.7k per month, but ended up opting for a datacenter that was only a couple blocks from our office in SF. Though this came at a premium, it was extremely helpful to get the initial nodes setup and for ongoing maintenance. Our team is just 5 people, so any friction in going to the datacenter would come at a noticeable cost to team productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Table 1: Cost comparison of cloud alternatives vs in-house. AWS is $1,130,000/month including estimated egress, Cloudflare is $270,000/month (with bulk-discounted pricing), and our datacenter is $29,500/month (including recurring costs and depreciation).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our price assuming three-year depreciation (including for the one-off install fees) is $17.5k/month in fixed monthly costs (internet, power, etc.) and $12k/month in depreciation, for $29.5k/month overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We compare our costs to two main providers: AWS’s public pricing numbers as a baseline, and Cloudflare’s discounted pricing for 30PB of storage. It’s important to note that AWS egress would be substantially lower if we utilized AWS GPUs. This is not reflected on our graph because AWS GPUs are priced at substantially above market prices and large clusters are difficult to attain, untenable at our compute scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the pricing breakdowns:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;$450,000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No egress fees&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Estimated Private Pricing [3] 3. Cloudflare has a more reasonable estimate for the 30 PB, placing it at an overall monthly cost of $270k without egress fees. We also have bulk-discounted pricing estimates after getting pricing quotes—this was our main point of comparison for the datacenter.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$0.009/GB/month&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$270,000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Estimated rate for &amp;gt;20 PB scale&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That brings monthly costs to $38/TB/month for AWS, $10/TB/month for Cloudflare, and $1/TB/month for our datacenter—about 38x lower and 10x lower respectively. (At the very cheapest end of the spectrum, Backblaze has a $6/TB product that is unsuitable for model training due to egress speed limitations; their $15/TB Overdrive AI-specific storage product is closer to Cloudflare’s in price &amp;amp; performance)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we use Cloudflare as a comparison point, we’ve sometimes done too much load for their R2 servers. In particular, in the past we’ve done enough load during large model training runs that they rate-limited us, later confirming we were saturating their metadata layer and the rate limit wasn’t synthetic. Because our metadata on the heap is so simple, and we have a 100Gbps DIA connection, we haven’t ran into any issues there. [4] 4. We love Cloudflare and use many of their products often; we include this anecdote as a fact about our scale being difficult to handle, not as a dig!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This setup was and is necessary for our video data pipelines, and we’re extremely happy that we made this investment. By gathering large scale data at low costs, we can be competitive with frontier labs with billions of dollars in capital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setup/The Process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We cared a lot about getting this built fast, because this kind of project can easily stretch on for months if not careful. Hence Storage Stacking Saturday, or S3. We threw a hard drive stacking party in downtown SF and got our friends to come, offering food and custom-engraved hard drives to all who helped. The hard drive stacking started at 6am and continued for 36 hours (with a break to sleep), and by the end of that time we had 30 PB of functioning hardware racked and wired up. We brought in contractors for additional help and professional installation later on in the event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People at the hard drive stacking party! Cool shots of the servers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our software is 200 lines of Rust code for writing (to determine the drive to write data onto) and a nginx webserver for reading data, with a simple SQLite db for tracking metadata like which heap node each file is on and what data split it belongs to. We kept this obsessively simple instead of using MinIO or Ceph because we didn’t need any of the features they provided; it’s much, much simpler to debug a 200-line program than to debug Ceph, and we weren’t worried about redundancy or sharding. All our drives were formatted with XFS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The storage software landscape offers many options, but every option available comes with drawbacks. People experienced with Ceph strongly warned us to avoid it unless we were willing to hire dedicated Ceph specialists—our research confirmed this advice. Ceph appears far more complex than justified for most use cases, only worthwhile for companies that absolutely need maximum performance and customizability and are prepared to invest heavily in tuning. Minio presents an interesting option if S3 compatibility is essential, but otherwise remains a bit too fancy for us and similar use-cases. Weka and Vast are absurdly expensive at 2k / TB / year or so and are primarily designed for NVMEs, not spinning disks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Post-Mortem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building the datacenter was a large endeavor and we definitely learned lessons, both good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Things That We Got Correct&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We think the redundancy &amp;amp; capability tradeoffs we made are very reasonable at our disk speeds. We’re able to approximately saturate our 100G network for both read &amp;amp; write.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Doing this locally a couple blocks away was well worth it because of the amount of debugging and manual work needed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ebay is good to find vendors but bad to actually buy things with. After finding vendors, they can often individually supply all the parts we need and provide warranties, which are extremely valuable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;100G dedicated internet is pretty important, and much much easier to debug issues with than using cloud products.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having high-quality cable management during the racking process saved us a ton of time debugging in the long run; making it easy to switch up the networking saved us a lot of headache.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We had a very strong simplicity prior, and this saved an immense amount of effort. We are quite happy that we didn’t use ceph or minio. Unlike e.g. nginx, they do not work out of the box. We were willing to write a simple Rust script and roughly saturated our network read &amp;amp; write at 100 Gbps without any fancy code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We were basically right about the price and advantages this offered, and did not substantially overestimate the amount of time / effort it would take. While the improvements list is longer than this, most of those are minor; fundamentally we built a cluster rivaling massive clouds for 40x cheaper.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Difficult Bits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A map of reality only gets you so far—while setting up the datacenter we ran into a couple problems and unexpected challenges. We’ll include a list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We used frontloaders instead of toploaders for our server rack. This meant we had to screw every single individual drive in—tedious for 2.4k HDDs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our storage was not dense—we could have saved 5x the work on physical placement and screwing by having a denser array of hard drives&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shortcuts like daisy-chaining are usually a bad idea. We could have gotten substantially higher read/write speeds without daisy chaining networked nodes, giving each chassis its own HBA (Host Bus Adapter, not a significant cost).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compatibility is key—specifically in networking functionally everything is locked to a specific brand. We had many pain points here. Fiber transceivers will ~never work unless used with the right brand, but copper cables are much more forgiving. FS.com is pretty good and well priced (though their speed estimates were pretty inconsistent); Amazon will also often have the parts you need rapidly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Networking came at substantial cost and required experimentation. In general, with our relatively non-sensitive training data, we optimized for convenience and ease of use over all else: we did not use DHCP as our used enterprise switches didn’t support it out of the box, and we didn’t use NAT as we wanted public IPs for the nodes for convenient and performant access from our servers. (We firewalled off unused ports and had basic security with nginx secure_link; we would not be able to do this if handling customer data, but it was fine for our use case.) While this is an area where we would have saved time with a cloud solution, we had our networking up within days and kinks ironed out within ~3 weeks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We were often bottlenecked by easy access to servers via monitor/keyboard; idle crash carts during setup are helpful.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ideas Worth Trying&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Working KVMs are extremely useful, and you shouldn’t go without them or good IPMI. Physically going to a datacenter is really inconvenient, even if it’s a block away. IPMI is good, but only if you have pretty consistent machines.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Think through your management Ethernet network as much as your real network - it’s really nice to be able to SSH into servers while configuring the network, and IPMI is great!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Overprovision your network—e.g. if doable it’s worth having 400 Gigabit internally (you can use 100G cards etc for this!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We could have substantially increased density at additional upfront cost by buying 90-drive SuperMicro SuperServers and putting 20TB drives into them. This would allow us to use 2 racks instead of 10, give us about the equivalent of 20 AMD 9654s in total CPU capacity, and use less total power.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How You Can Build This Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to replicate our setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Storage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;10 CPU head nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;We used Intel Rr2000 with Dual Intel Gold 6148 and 128GB of DDR4 ECC RAM per server (which are incredibly cheap and roughly worked for our use cases) but you have a lot of flexibility in what you use.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;If you use the above configuration you likely won’t be able to do anything at all CPU-intensive on the servers (like on-device data processing or ZFS data compression / deduplication / etc, which is valuable if you’re storing non-video data).&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Our CPU nodes cost $600 each—it seems quite reasonable to us to spend up to $3k each if you want ZFS / compression or the abiliy to do data processing on-CPU.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;100 DS4246 chassis—each can hold 24 hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2,400 3.5 inch HDDs—need to be all SATA or all SAS in each chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;We would recommend SAS hard drives if possible [5] 5. if you use SAS drives you’ll need to deal with or disable mulipathing, which is reasonably simple as they roughly double speed over similar SATA drives.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;We used a mix of 12TB and 14TB drives—basically any size should work, roughly the larger the better holding price constant (density makes stacking easier + in general increases resale value).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Physical parts to mount the chassis—you’ll need rails or l-brackets. We used l-brackets which worked well, as we haven’t needed to take the chassis out to slot hard drives. If you buy toploaders, you’ll need rails.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multiple “crash carts” with monitors and keyboards that allow you to physically connect to your CPU head nodes and configure them—this is invaluable when you’re debugging network issues.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Network&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A 100 GbE switch&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;A used Arista is fine, should be QSFP28, should cost about $1-2k.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HBAs (Host Bus Adapters), which connect your head nodes to your DS4246 chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The best configuration we tried was with Broadcom 9305-16E HBAs, with 3x HBAs per server (make sure your server has physical space for them!) with SFF-8644 to QSFP mini SAS cables.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;There are 4 slots per HBA, so you can cable each DS4246 chassis directly to the HBA. [6] 6. The option we ended up going with for convenience was putting LSI SAS9207-8e HBAs, which have 2 ports each, into the CPU head nodes- then daisy-chaining the DS4246s together with QSFP+ to QSFP+ DACs.. We deployed this on Storage Stacking Saturday, then while debugging speeds tried the above method on one of the servers and got to ~4 Gbps per chassis-but didn’t find it worth it to swap everything out in pure labor because of the way we had set up some of our head nodes such that they were difficult to take out. Insofar as it is reasonably cheap to just do the above thing to start and we’ve tested it to work, you should probably do as we say, not as we did in this case!&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Network cards (NICs).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;We used Mellanox ConnectX-4 100GbE. Make sure they come in Ethernet mode and not Infiniband mode for ease of config.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DAC (Direct Attach Copper) or AOC (Active Optical) cables, to connect the NICs in your head nodes to your switch and therefore the internet. You almost certainly want DACs if your racks are close together, as they are far more compatible with arbitrary networking equipment than AOCs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We would recommend that you find a supplier to sell you the CPU head nodes with the HBAs and NICs installed—there are a number of used datacenter / enterprise parts suppliers who are willing to do this. This is a substantial positive because it means that you don’t have to spend hours installing the HBAs/NICs yourself and can have a substantially higher degree of confidence in your operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Serial cables—you’ll need these to connect to your switch!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Optional but recommended: an Ethernet management network of some kind. If you can’t easily get ethernet, we’d recommend getting a wifi adapter like this and then a ethernet switch like this —it’s substantially easier to set up than the 100GbE, is a great backup for when that’s not working, and will allow you to do ~everything over SSH from the comfort of the office instead of in the datacenter.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Datacenter Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3.5 kW of usable power per cabinet, with 10 4U chassis + 1 2U (cabinets are 42U tall)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 spare cabinet for the 1U or 2U 100GbE switch (you can obviously also just swap out one of the 4U chassis in another cabinet for the switch).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 42U cabinet per 3 PB of storage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A dedicated 100G connection (will come in as a fiber pair probably via QSFP28 LR4, but confirm with your datacenter provider before buying parts here!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ideally physically near your office—there is a lot of value in being able to walk over and debug issues instead of e.g. dealing with remote hands services to get internet to the nodes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some setup tips:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure to first properly configure your switch. Depending on your switch model this should be relatively straightforward—you’ll need to physically connect to the switch and then configure the specific port that your 100GbE is connected to (you’ll get a fiber cross-connect from your datacenter that you should plug into a QSFP28 transceiver. Make sure that you get a transceiver that is compatible in form with the ISP, probably LR4, and specifically branded with your switch brand, otherwise it is very unlikely to work). Depending on your ISP you might have to talk to them to make sure that you can get “light” through the fiber cables from both ends, which might involve rolling the fiber and otherwise making sure it’s working properly. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If your switch isn’t working / you haven’t configured one before, I’d suggest trying to directly plug the fiber cable from the ISP into one of your 10 heap servers, making sure to buy a transceiver that is compatible with your NIC brand (e.g. Mellanox). Once you get it working from there, move over to your switch and get it working.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once you can connect to the internet from your switch (simply ping 1.1.1.1 to check) you are ready to set up the netplans for the individual nodes. this is most easily done during the Ubuntu setup process, which will walk you through setting up internet for your CPU head nodes, but is also doable outside of that&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have internet access to your nodes and have properly connected 1 cable to each DS4246, you should format &amp;amp; mount the drives on each node, test that all of them are properly working, and then you are ready to deploy any software you want.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The RAG Obituary: Killed by Agents, Buried by Context Windows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Retrieval-Augmented Generation Won’t Survive the Context Revolution and the End of Chunking, Embeddings, and Rerankers as We Know Them.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working in AI and search for a decade. First building Doctrine, the largest European legal search engine and now building Fintool, an AI-powered financial research platform that helps institutional investors analyze companies, screen stocks, and make investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After three years of building, optimizing, and scaling LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, I believe we’re witnessing the twilight of RAG-based architectures. As context windows explode and agent-based architectures mature, my controversial opinion is that the current RAG infrastructure we spent so much time building and optimizing is on the decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Rise of Retrieval-Augmented Generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2022, ChatGPT took the world by storm. People started endless conversations, delegating crucial work only to realize that the underlying model, GPT-3.5 could only handle 4,096 tokens... roughly six pages of text!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AI world faced a fundamental problem: how do you make an intelligent system work with knowledge bases that are orders of magnitude larger than what it can read at once?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer became Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an architectural pattern that would dominate AI for the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Mathematical Reality of Early LLMs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT-3.5 could handle 4,096 token and the next model GPT-4 doubled it to 8,192 tokens, about twelve pages. This wasn’t just inconvenient; it was architecturally devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the numbers: A single SEC 10-K filing contains approximately 51,000 tokens (130+ pages).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With 8,192 tokens, you could see less than 16% of a 10-K filing. It’s like reading a financial report through a keyhole!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The RAG Architecture: A Technical Deep Dive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RAG emerged as an elegant solution borrowed directly from search engines. Just as Google displays 10 blue links with relevant snippets for your query, RAG retrieves the most pertinent document fragments and feeds them to the LLM for synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea is beautifully simple: if you can’t fit everything in context, find the most relevant pieces and use those. It turns LLMs into sophisticated search result summarizers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, LLMs can’t read the whole book but they can know who dies at the end; convenient!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Chunking Challenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long documents need to be chunked into pieces and it’s when problems start. Those digestible pieces are typically 400-1,000 tokens each which is basically 300-750 words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem? It isn’t as simple as cutting every 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider chunking a typical SEC 10-K annual report. The document has a complex hierarchical structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Item 1: Business Overview (10-15 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Item 1A: Risk Factors (20-30 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (30-40 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Item 8: Financial Statements (40-50 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After naive chunking at 500 tokens, critical information gets scattered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Revenue recognition policies split across 3 chunks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A risk factor explanation broken mid-sentence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Financial table headers separated from their data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- MD&amp;amp;A narrative divorced from the numbers it’s discussing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you search for “revenue growth drivers,” you might get a chunk mentioning growth but miss the actual numerical data in a different chunk, or the strategic context from MD&amp;amp;A in yet another chunk!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Fintool, we’ve developed sophisticated chunking strategies that go beyond naive text splitting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Hierarchical Structure Preservation: We maintain the nested structure from Item 1 (Business) down to sub-sections like geographic segments, creating a tree-like document representation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Table Integrity: Financial tables are never split—income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements remain atomic units with headers and data together&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Cross-Reference Preservation: We maintain links between narrative sections and their corresponding financial data, preserving the “See Note X” relationships&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Temporal Coherence: Year-over-year comparisons and multi-period analyses stay together as single chunks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Footnote Association: Footnotes remain connected to their referenced items through metadata linking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each chunk at Fintool is enriched with extensive metadata:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Filing type (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Fiscal period and reporting date&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Section hierarchy (Item 7 &amp;gt; Liquidity &amp;gt; Cash Position)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Table identifiers and types&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Cross-reference mappings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Company identifiers (CIK, ticker)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Industry classification codes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows for more accurate retrieval but even our intelligent chunking can’t solve the fundamental problem: we’re still working with fragments instead of complete documents!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have the chunks, you need a way to search them. One way is to embed your chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Embedding and Retrieval Pipeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each chunk is converted into a high‑dimensional vector (typically 1,536 dimensions in most embedding models). These vectors live in a space where, theoretically, similar concepts are close together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a user asks a question, that question also becomes a vector. The system finds the chunks whose vectors are closest to the query vector using cosine similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s elegant in theory and in practice, it’s a nightmare of edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embedding models are trained on general text and struggle with specific terminologies. They find similarities but they can’t distinguish between “revenue recognition” (accounting policy) and “revenue growth” (business performance).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider that example: Query: “What is the company’s litigation exposure?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RAG searches for “litigation” and returns 50 chunks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Chunks 1-10: Various mentions of “litigation” in boilerplate risk factors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Chunks 11-20: Historical cases from 2019 (already settled)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Chunks 21-30: Forward-looking safe harbor statements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Chunks 31-40: Duplicate descriptions from different sections&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Chunks 41-50: Generic “we may face litigation” warnings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What RAG Reports: $500M in litigation (from Legal Proceedings section)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s Actually There:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- $500M in Legal Proceedings (Item 3)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- $700M in Contingencies note (”not material individually”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- $1B new class action in Subsequent Events&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- $800M indemnification obligations (different section)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- $2B probable losses in footnotes (keyword “probable” not “litigation”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual Exposure is $5.1B. 10x what RAG found. Oupsy! By late 2023, most builders realized pure vector search wasn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Hybrid Search: The Complexity That Actually Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter hybrid search: combine semantic search (embeddings) with the traditional keyword search (BM25). This is where things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a probabilistic retrieval model that excels at exact term matching. Unlike embeddings, BM25:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Rewards Exact Matches: When you search for “EBITDA,” you get documents with “EBITDA,” not “operating income” or “earnings”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Handles Rare Terms Better: Financial jargon like “CECL” (Current Expected Credit Losses) or “ASC 606” gets proper weight&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Document Length Normalization: Doesn’t penalize longer documents&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Term Frequency Saturation: Multiple mentions of “revenue” don’t overshadow other important terms&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Fintool, we’ve built a sophisticated hybrid search system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Parallel Processing: We run semantic and keyword searches simultaneously&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Dynamic Weighting: Our system adjusts weights based on query characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Specific financial metrics? BM25 gets 70% weight&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Conceptual questions? Embeddings get 60% weight&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Mixed queries? 50/50 split with result analysis&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Score Normalization: Different scoring scales are normalized using:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Min-max scaling for BM25 scores&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Cosine similarity already normalized for embeddings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Z-score normalization for outlier handling&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So at the end the embeddings search and the keywords search retrieve chunks and the search engine combines them using Reciprocal Rank Fusion. RRF merges rankings so items that consistently appear near the top across systems float higher, even if no system put them at #1!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now you think it’s done right? But hell no!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Reranking Bottleneck: RAG’s Dirty Secret&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what nobody talks about: even after all that retrieval work, you’re not done. You need to rerank the chunks one more time to get a good retrieval and it’s not easy. Rerankers are ML models that take the search results and reorder them by relevance to your specific query limiting the number of chunks sent to the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only LLMs are context poor, they also struggle when dealing with too much information. It’s vital to reduce the number of chunks sent to the LLM for the final answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Reranking Pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Initial search retrieval with embeddings + keywords gets you 100-200 chunks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Reranker ranks the top 10&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Top 10 are fed to the LLM to answer the question&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the challenge with reranking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Latency Explosion: Rerank adds between 300-2000ms per query. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Cost Multiplication: it adds significant extra cost to every query. For instance, Cohere Rerank 3.5 costs $2.00 per 1,000 search units, making reranking expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Context Limits: Rerankers typically handle few chunks (Cohere Rerank supports only 4096 tokens), so if you need to re-rank more than that, you have to split it into different parallel API calls and merge them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Another Model to Manage: One more API, one more failure point&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Re-rank is one more step in a complex pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Infrastructure Burden of Traditional RAG&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I find difficult with RAG is what I call the “cascading failure problem”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Chunking can fail (split tables) or be too slow (especially when you have to ingest and chunk gigabytes of data in real-time)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Embedding can fail (wrong similarity)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. BM25 can fail (term mismatch)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Hybrid fusion can fail (bad weights)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Reranking can fail (wrong priorities)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each stage compounds the errors of the previous stage. Beyond the complexity of hybrid search itself, there’s an infrastructure burden that’s rarely discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running production Elasticsearch is not easy. You’re looking at maintaining TB+ of indexed data for comprehensive document coverage, which requires 128-256GB RAM minimum just to get decent performance. The real nightmare comes with re-indexing. Every schema change forces a full re-indexing that takes 48-72 hours for large datasets. On top of that, you’re constantly dealing with cluster management, sharding strategies, index optimization, cache tuning, backup and disaster recovery, and version upgrades that regularly include breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Fundamental Limitations of RAG for Complex Documents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some structural limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Context Fragmentation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Long documents are interconnected webs, not independent paragraphs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A single question might require information from 20+ documents&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Chunking destroys these relationships permanently&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Semantic Search Fails on Numbers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- “$45.2M” and “$45,200,000” have different embeddings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- “Revenue increased 10%” and “Revenue grew by a tenth” rank differently&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Tables full of numbers have poor semantic representations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. No Causal Understanding&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- RAG can’t follow “See Note 12” → Note 12 → Schedule K&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Can’t understand that discontinued operations affect continuing operations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Can’t trace how one financial item impacts another&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. The Vocabulary Mismatch Problem&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Companies use different terms for the same concept&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- “Adjusted EBITDA” vs “Operating Income Before Special Items”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- RAG retrieves based on terms, not concepts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Temporal Blindness&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Can’t distinguish Q3 2024 from Q3 2023 reliably&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Mixes current period with prior period comparisons&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No understanding of fiscal year boundaries&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These aren’t minor issues. They’re fundamental limitations of the retrieval paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three months ago I stumbled on an innovation on retrievial that blew my mind&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Emergence of Agentic Search - A New Paradigm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In May 2025, Anthropic released Claude Code, an AI coding agent that works in the terminal. At first, I was surprised by the form factor. A terminal? Are we back in 1980? no UI?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back then, I was using Cursor, a product that excelled at traditional RAG. I gave it access to my codebase to embed my files and Cursor ran a search n my codebase before answering my query. Life was good. But when testing Claude Code, one thing stood out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was better and faster and not because their RAG was better but because there was no RAG.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How Claude Code Search Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of a complex pipeline of chunking, embedding, and searching, Claude Code uses direct filesystem tools:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Grep (Ripgrep)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Lightning-fast regex search through file contents&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No indexing required. It searches live files instantly&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Full regex support for precise pattern matching&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Can filter by file type or use glob patterns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Returns exact matches with context lines&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Glob&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Direct file discovery by name patterns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Finds files like `**/*.py` or `src/**/*.ts` instantly&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Returns files sorted by modification time (recency bias)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Zero overhead—just filesystem traversal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Task Agents&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Autonomous multi-step exploration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Handle complex queries requiring investigation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Combine multiple search strategies adaptively&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Build understanding incrementally&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Self-correct based on findings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, Grep was invented in 1973. It’s so... primitive. And that’s the genius of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code doesn’t retrieve. It investigates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Runs multiple searches in parallel (Grep + Glob simultaneously)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Starts broad, then narrows based on discoveries&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Follows references and dependencies naturally&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No embeddings, no similarity scores, no reranking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s simple, it’s fast and it’s based on a new assumption that LLMs will go from context poor to context rich.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code proved that with sufficient context and intelligent navigation, you don’t need RAG at all. The agent can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Load entire files or modules directly&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Follow cross-references in real-time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Understand structure and relationships&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Maintain complete context throughout investigation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t just better than RAG—it’s a fundamentally different paradigm. And what works for code can work for any long documents that are not coding files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Context Revolution: From Scarcity to Abundance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The context window explosion made Claude Code possible:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2022-2025 Context-Poor Era:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- GPT-4: 8K tokens (~12 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- GPT-4-32k: 32K tokens (~50 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025 and beyond Context Revolution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Claude Sonnet 4: 200k tokens (~700 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Gemini 2.5: 1M tokens (~3,000 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Grok 4-fast: 2M tokens (~6,000 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 2M tokens, you can fit an entire year of SEC filings for most companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trajectory is even more dramatic: we’re likely heading toward 10M+ context windows by 2027, with Sam Altman hinting at billions of context tokens on the horizon. This represents a fundamental shift in how AI systems process information. Equally important, attention mechanisms are rapidly improving—LLMs are becoming far better at maintaining coherence and focus across massive context windows without getting “lost” in the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Claude Code Insight: Why Context Changes Everything&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code demonstrated that with enough context, search becomes navigation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No need to retrieve fragments when you can load complete files&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No need for similarity when you can use exact matches&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No need for reranking when you follow logical paths&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No need for embeddings when you have direct access&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s mind-blowing. LLMs are getting really good at agentic behaviors meaning they can organize their work into tasks to accomplish an objective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what tools like ripgrep bring to the search table:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No Setup: No index. No overhead. Just point and search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Instant Availability: New documents are searchable the moment they hit the filesystem (no indexing latency!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Zero Maintenance: No clusters to manage, no indices to optimize, no RAM to provision&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Blazing Fast: For a 100K line codebase, Elasticsearch needs minutes to index. Ripgrep searches it in milliseconds with zero prep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Cost: $0 infrastructure cost vs a lot of $$$ for Elasticsearch&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So back to our previous example on SEC filings. An agent can SEC filing structure intrinsically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Hierarchical Awareness: Knows that Item 1A (Risk Factors) relates to Item 7 (MD&amp;amp;A)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Cross-Reference Following: Automatically traces “See Note 12” references&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Multi-Document Coordination: Connects 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, and proxy statements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Temporal Analysis: Compares year-over-year changes systematically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For searches across thousands of companies or decades of filings, it might still use hybrid search, but now as a tool for agents:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Initial broad search using hybrid retrieval&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Agent loads full documents for top results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Deep analysis within full context&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Iterative refinement based on findings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My guess is traditional RAG is now a search tool among others and that agents will always prefer grep and reading the whole file because they are context rich and can handle long-running tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider our $6.5B lease obligation question as an example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 1: Find “lease” in main financial statements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;→ Discovers “See Note 12”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 2: Navigate to Note 12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;→ Finds “excluding discontinued operations (Note 23)”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 3: Check Note 23&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;→ Discovers $2B additional obligations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 4: Cross-reference with MD&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;→ Identifies management’s explanation and adjustments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 5: Search for “subsequent events”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;→ Finds post-balance sheet $500M lease termination&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final answer: $5B continuing + $2B discontinued - $500M terminated = $6.5B&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent follows references like a human analyst would. No chunks. No embeddings. No reranking. Just intelligent navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, RAG is like a research assistant with perfect memory but no understanding:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- “Here are 50 passages that mention debt”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Can’t tell you if debt is increasing or why&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Can’t connect debt to strategic changes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Can’t identify hidden obligations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Just retrieves text, doesn’t comprehend relationships&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agentic search is like a forensic accountant:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Follows the money systematically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Understands accounting relationships (assets = liabilities + equity)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Identifies what’s missing or hidden&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Connects dots across time periods and documents&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Challenges management assertions with data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Agentic Search Represents the Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Increasing Document Complexity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Documents are becoming longer and more interconnected&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Cross-references and external links are proliferating&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Multiple related documents need to be understood together&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Systems must follow complex trails of information&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Structured Data Integration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- More documents combine structured and unstructured data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Tables, narratives, and metadata must be understood together&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Relationships matter more than isolated facts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Context determines meaning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Real-Time Requirements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Information needs instant processing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No time for re-indexing or embedding updates&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Dynamic document structures require adaptive approaches&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Live data demands live search&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Cross-Document Understanding&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern analysis requires connecting multiple sources:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Primary documents&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Supporting materials&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Historical versions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Related filings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RAG treats each document independently. Agentic search builds cumulative understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Precision Over Similarity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Exact information matters more than similar content&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Following references beats finding related text&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Structure and hierarchy provide crucial context&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Navigation beats retrieval&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evidence is becoming clear. While RAG served us well in the context-poor era, agentic search represents a fundamental evolution. The potential benefits of agentic search are compelling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Elimination of hallucinations from missing context&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Complete answers instead of fragments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Faster insights through parallel exploration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Higher accuracy through systematic navigation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Massive infrastructure cost reduction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Zero index maintenance overhead&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key insight? Complex document analysis—whether code, financial filings, or legal contracts—isn’t about finding similar text. It’s about understanding relationships, following references, and maintaining precision. The combination of large context windows and intelligent navigation delivers what retrieval alone never could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RAG was a clever workaround for a context-poor era. It helped us bridge the gap between tiny windows and massive documents, but it was always a band-aid. The future won’t be about splitting documents into fragments and juggling embeddings. It will be about agents that can navigate, reason, and hold entire corpora in working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are entering the post-retrieval age. The winners will not be the ones who maintain the biggest vector databases, but the ones who design the smartest agents to traverse abundant context and connect meaning across documents. In hindsight, RAG will look like training wheels. Useful, necessary, but temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next decade of AI search will belong to systems that read and reason end-to-end. Retrieval isn’t dead—it’s just been demoted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Future of AI Delivered on Time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI understands text, images, audio, and video.&lt;lb/&gt;But the real world runs on time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every heartbeat, price tick, sensor pulse, machine log, and user click is a temporal signal.&lt;lb/&gt;Current models can't reason about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're changing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A New Class of Foundation Models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time-Series Language Models (TSLMs) are multimodal foundation models with time series as a native modality, next to text, enabling direct reasoning, explanation, and forecasting over temporal data in natural language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our research shows order-of-magnitude gains in temporal reasoning while running on smaller, faster backbones. TSLMs are not an add-on. They're a new modality for AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Open Core, Frontier Edge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenTSLM: Lightweight base models trained on public data, released openly. They set the standard for temporal reasoning and power a global developer and research ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frontier TSLMs: Advanced proprietary models trained on specialized data, delivering enterprise-grade performance and powering APIs, fine-tuning, and vertical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our Vision&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building the temporal interface for AI - the layer that connects continuous real-world signals to intelligent decisions and autonomous agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A universal TSLM will power proactive healthcare, adaptive robotics, resilient infrastructure, and new forms of human-AI collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About Us&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenTSLM is a team of scientists, engineers, and builders from ETH, Stanford, Harvard, Cambridge, TUM, CDTM, Google, Meta, AWS, and beyond. We are the original authors of the OpenTSLM paper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say the word “politics” to most engineers and watch their face scrunch up like they just bit into a lemon. We’ve all been conditioned to believe that workplace politics is this dirty game played by manipulative ladder-climbers while the “real” engineers focus on the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to think the same way. For years as an engineer, I wore my hatred of politics like a badge of honor. I was above all that nonsense. I just wanted to ship. Politics was for those other people, the ones who didn’t have what it takes technically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I think the opposite: politics isn’t the problem; bad politics is. And pretending politics doesn’t exist? That’s how bad politics wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Politics is just how humans coordinate in groups. It’s the invisible network of relationships, influence, and informal power that exists in every organization. You can refuse to participate, but that doesn’t make it go away. It just means decisions get made without you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about the last time a terrible technical decision got pushed through at your company. Maybe it was adopting some overcomplicated architecture, or choosing a vendor that everyone knew was wrong, or killing a project that was actually working. I bet if you dig into what happened, you’ll find it wasn’t because the decision-makers were stupid. It’s because the people with the right information weren’t in the room. They “didn’t do politics.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, someone who understood how influence works was in that room, making their case, building coalitions, showing they’d done their homework. And their idea won. Not because it was better, but because they showed up to play while everyone else was “too pure” for politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideas don’t speak. People do. And the people who understand how to navigate organizational dynamics, build relationships, and yes, play politics? Their ideas get heard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you build strong relationships across teams, understand what motivates different stakeholders, and know how to build consensus, you’re doing politics. When you take time to explain your technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders in language they understand, that’s politics. When you grab coffee with someone from another team to understand their challenges, that’s politics too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good politics is just being strategic about relationships and influence in the service of good outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best technical leaders are incredibly political. They just don’t call it that. They call it “stakeholder management” or “building alignment” or “organizational awareness.” But it’s politics, and they’re good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineers who refuse to engage with politics often complain that their companies make bad technical decisions. But they’re not willing to do what it takes to influence those decisions. They want a world where technical merit alone determines outcomes. That world doesn’t exist and never has.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t about becoming a scheming backstabber. As I wrote in Your Strengths Are Your Weaknesses, the same trait can be positive or negative depending on how you use it. Politics is the same way. You can use political skills to manipulate and self-promote, or you can use them to get good ideas implemented and protect your team from bad decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what good politics looks like in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building relationships before you need them. That random coffee with someone from the data team? Six months later, they’re your biggest advocate for getting engineering resources for your data pipeline project.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Understanding the real incentives. Your VP doesn’t care about your beautiful microservices architecture. They care about shipping features faster. Frame your technical proposals in terms of what they actually care about.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Managing up effectively. Your manager is juggling competing priorities you don’t see. Keep them informed about what matters, flag problems early with potential solutions, and help them make good decisions. When they trust you to handle things, they’ll fight for you when it matters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creating win-win situations. Instead of fighting for resources, find ways to help other teams while getting what you need. It doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Being visible. If you do great work but nobody knows about it, did it really happen? Share your wins, present at all-hands, write those design docs that everyone will reference later.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternative to good politics isn’t no politics. It’s bad politics winning by default. It’s the loud person who’s wrong getting their way because the quiet person who’s right won’t speak up. It’s good projects dying because nobody advocated for them. It’s talented people leaving because they couldn’t navigate the organizational dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop pretending you’re above politics. You’re not. Nobody is. The only question is whether you’ll get good at it or keep losing to people who already are.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Jane Goodall, who transformed understanding of humankind by studying chimpanzees, dies at 91&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Share via&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jane Goodall, the trailblazing naturalist whose intimate observations of chimpanzees in the African wild produced powerful insights that transformed basic conceptions of humankind, has died. She was 91.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tireless advocate of preserving chimpanzees’ natural habitat, Goodall died on Wednesday morning in California of natural causes, the Jane Goodall Institute announced on its Instagram page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Dr. Goodall’s discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science,” the Jane Goodall Institute said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A protege of anthropologist Louis S.B. Leakey, Goodall made history in 1960 when she discovered that chimpanzees, humankind’s closest living ancestors, made and used tools, characteristics that scientists had long thought were exclusive to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She also found that chimps hunted prey, ate meat, and were capable of a range of emotions and behaviors similar to those of humans, including filial love, grief and violence bordering on warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the course of establishing one of the world’s longest-running studies of wild animal behavior at what is now Tanzania’s Gombe Stream National Park, she gave her chimp subjects names instead of numbers, a practice that raised eyebrows in the male-dominated field of primate studies in the 1960s. But within a decade, the trim British scientist with the tidy ponytail was a National Geographic heroine, whose books and films educated a worldwide audience with stories of the apes she called David Graybeard, Mr. McGregor, Gilka and Flo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When we read about a woman who gives funny names to chimpanzees and then follows them into the bush, meticulously recording their every grunt and groom, we are reluctant to admit such activity into the big leagues,” the late biologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote of the scientific world’s initial reaction to Goodall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Goodall overcame her critics and produced work that Gould later characterized as “one of the Western world’s great scientific achievements.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tenacious and keenly observant, Goodall paved the way for other women in primatology, including the late gorilla researcher Dian Fossey and orangutan expert Birutė Galdikas. She was honored in 1995 with the National Geographic Society’s Hubbard Medal, which then had been bestowed only 31 times in the previous 90 years to such eminent figures as North Pole explorer Robert E. Peary and aviator Charles Lindbergh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In her 80s she continued to travel 300 days a year to speak to schoolchildren and others about the need to fight deforestation, preserve chimpanzees’ natural habitat and promote sustainable development in Africa. She was in California as part of her speaking tour in the U.S. at the time of her death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jane Goodall brings “The Book of Hope” to the Los Angeles Times Book Club Feb. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goodall was born April 3, 1934, in London and grew up in the English coastal town of Bournemouth. The daughter of a businessman and a writer who separated when she was a child and later divorced, she was raised in a matriarchal household that included her maternal grandmother, her mother, Vanne, some aunts and her sister, Judy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She demonstrated an affinity for nature from a young age, filling her bedroom with worms and sea snails that she rushed back to their natural homes after her mother told her they would otherwise die.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When she was about 5, she disappeared for hours to a dark henhouse to see how chickens laid eggs, so absorbed that she was oblivious to her family’s frantic search for her. She did not abandon her study until she observed the wondrous event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Suddenly with a plop, the egg landed on the straw. With clucks of pleasure the hen shook her feathers, nudged the egg with her beak, and left,” Goodall wrote almost 60 years later. “It is quite extraordinary how clearly I remember that whole sequence of events.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wildlife biologist Miguel Ordeñana was passionate about wild animals as a kid. In Jane Goodall, he found hope that would shape his life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When finally she ran out of the henhouse with the exciting news, her mother did not scold her but patiently listened to her daughter’s account of her first scientific observation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, she gave Goodall books about animals and adventure — especially the Doctor Dolittle tales and Tarzan. Her daughter became so enchanted with Tarzan’s world that she insisted on doing her homework in a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I was madly in love with the Lord of the Jungle, terribly jealous of his Jane,” Goodall wrote in her 1999 memoir, “Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey.” “It was daydreaming about life in the forest with Tarzan that led to my determination to go to Africa, to live with animals and write books about them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her opportunity came after she finished high school. A week before Christmas in 1956 she was invited to visit an old school chum’s family farm in Kenya. Goodall saved her earnings from a waitress job until she had enough for a round-trip ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She arrived in Kenya in 1957, thrilled to be living in the Africa she had “always felt stirring in my blood.” At a dinner party in Nairobi shortly after her arrival, someone told her that if she was interested in animals, she should meet Leakey, already famous for his discoveries in East Africa of man’s fossil ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She went to see him at what’s now the National Museum of Kenya, where he was curator. He hired her as a secretary and soon had her helping him and his wife, Mary, dig for fossils at Olduvai Gorge, a famous site in the Serengeti Plains in what is now northern Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leakey spoke to her of his desire to learn more about all the great apes. He said he had heard of a community of chimpanzees on the rugged eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika where an intrepid researcher might make valuable discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Goodall told him this was exactly the kind of work she dreamed of doing, Leakey agreed to send her there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took Leakey two years to find funding, which gave Goodall time to study primate behavior and anatomy in London. She finally landed in Gombe in the summer of 1960.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a rocky outcropping she called the Peak, Goodall made her first important observation. Scientists had thought chimps were docile vegetarians, but on this day about three months after her arrival, Goodall spied a group of the apes feasting on something pink. It turned out to be a baby bush pig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, she made an even more exciting discovery — the one that would establish her reputation. She had begun to recognize individual chimps, and on a rainy October day in 1960, she spotted the one with white hair on his chin. He was sitting beside a mound of red earth, carefully pushing a blade of grass into a hole, then withdrawing it and poking it into his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he finally ambled off, Goodall hurried over for a closer look. She picked up the abandoned grass stalk, stuck it into the same hole and pulled it out to find it covered with termites. The chimp she later named David Graybeard had been using the stalk to fish for the bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It was hard for me to believe what I had seen,” Goodall later wrote. “It had long been thought that we were the only creatures on earth that used and made tools. ‘Man the Toolmaker’ is how we were defined ...” What Goodall saw challenged man’s uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When she sent her report to Leakey, he responded: “We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goodall’s startling finding, published in Nature in 1964, enabled Leakey to line up funding to extend her stay at Gombe. It also eased Goodall’s admission to Cambridge University to study ethology. In 1965, she became the eighth person in Cambridge history to earn a doctorate without first having a bachelor’s degree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, she had met and in 1964 married Hugo Van Lawick, a gifted filmmaker who had traveled to Gombe to make a documentary about her chimp project. They had a child, Hugo Eric Louis — later nicknamed Grub — in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goodall later said that raising Grub, who lived at Gombe until he was 9, gave her insights into the behavior of chimp mothers. Conversely, she had “no doubt that my observation of the chimpanzees helped me to be a better mother.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“So,” Brett Morgen began, “you’ve been telling your story for so many years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She and Van Lawick were married for 10 years, divorcing in 1974. The following year she married Derek Bryceson, director of Tanzania National Parks. He died of colon cancer four years later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within a year of arriving at Gombe, Goodall had chimps literally eating out of her hands. Toward the end of her second year there, David Graybeard, who had shown the least fear of her, was the first to allow her physical contact. She touched him lightly and he permitted her to groom him for a full minute before gently pushing her hand away. For an adult male chimpanzee who had grown up in the wild to tolerate physical contact with a human was, she wrote in her 1971 book “In the Shadow of Man,” “a Christmas gift to treasure.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her studies yielded a trove of other observations on behaviors, including etiquette (such as soliciting a pat on the rump to indicate submission) and the sex lives of chimps. She collected some of the most fascinating information on the latter by watching Flo, an older female with a bulbous nose and an amazing retinue of suitors who was bearing children well into her 40s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her reports initially caused much skepticism in the scientific community. “I was not taken very seriously by many of the scientists. I was known as a [National] Geographic cover girl,” she recalled in a CBS interview in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her unorthodox personalizing of the chimps was particularly controversial. The editor of one of her first published papers insisted on crossing out all references to the creatures as “he” or “she” in favor of “it.” Goodall eventually prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her most disturbing studies came in the mid-1970s, when she and her team of field workers began to record a series of savage attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The incidents grew into what Goodall called the four-year war, a period of brutality carried out by a band of male chimpanzees from a region known as the Kasakela Valley. The marauders beat and slashed to death all the males in a neighboring colony and subjugated the breeding females, essentially annihilating an entire community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was the first time a scientist had witnessed organized aggression by one group of non-human primates against another. Goodall said this “nightmare time” forever changed her view of ape nature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“During the first 10 years of the study I had believed ... that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings,” she wrote in “Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey,” a 1999 book co-authored with Phillip Berman. “Then suddenly we found that the chimpanzees could be brutal — that they, like us, had a dark side to their nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics tried to dismiss the evidence as merely anecdotal. Others thought she was wrong to publicize the violence, fearing that irresponsible scientists would use the information to “prove” that the tendency to war is innate in humans, a legacy from their ape ancestors. Goodall persisted in talking about the attacks, maintaining that her purpose was not to support or debunk theories about human aggression but to “understand a little better” the nature of chimpanzee aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My question was: How far along our human path, which has led to hatred and evil and full-scale war, have chimpanzees traveled?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her observations of chimp violence marked a turning point for primate researchers, who had considered it taboo to talk about chimpanzee behavior in human terms. But by the 1980s, much chimp behavior was being interpreted in ways that would have been labeled anthropomorphism — ascribing human traits to non-human entities — decades earlier. Goodall, in removing the barriers, raised primatology to new heights, opening the way for research on subjects ranging from political coalitions among baboons to the use of deception by an array of primates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chimp change&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her concern about protecting chimpanzees in the wild and in captivity led her in 1977 to found the Jane Goodall Institute to advocate for great apes and support research and public education. She also established Roots and Shoots, a program aimed at youths in 130 countries, and TACARE, which involves African villagers in sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She became an international ambassador for chimps and conservation in 1986 when she saw a film about the mistreatment of laboratory chimps. The secretly taped footage “was like looking into the Holocaust,” she told interviewer Cathleen Rountree in 1998. From that moment, she became a globe-trotting crusader for animal rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 2017 documentary “Jane,” the producer pored through 140 hours of footage of Goodall that had been hidden away in the National Geographic archives. The film won a Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. Award, one of many honors it received.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a ranging 2009 interview with Times columnist Patt Morrison, Goodall mused on topics from traditional zoos — she said most captive environments should be abolished — to climate change, a battle she feared humankind was quickly losing, if not lost already. She also spoke about the power of what one human can accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I always say, ‘If you would spend just a little bit of time learning about the consequences of the choices you make each day’ — what you buy, what you eat, what you wear, how you interact with people and animals — and start consciously making choices, that would be beneficial rather than harmful.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the years passed, Goodall continued to track Gombe’s chimps, accumulating enough information to draw the arcs of their lives — from birth through sometimes troubled adolescence, maturity, illness and finally death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She wrote movingly about how she followed Mr. McGregor, an older, somewhat curmudgeonly chimp, through his agonizing death from polio, and how the orphan Gilka survived to lonely adulthood only to have her babies snatched from her by a pair of cannibalistic female chimps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her reaction in 1972 to the death of Flo, a prolific female known as Gombe’s most devoted mother, suggested the depth of feeling that Goodall had for the animals. Knowing that Flo’s faithful son Flint was nearby and grieving, Goodall watched over the body all night to keep marauding bush pigs from violating her remains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“People say to me, thank you for giving them characters and personalities,” Goodall once told CBS’s “60 Minutes.” “I said I didn’t give them anything. I merely translated them for people.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difference between being good and being great isn’t talent or formal training, but the invisible practice that happens when you're just living life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Budapest. Sometime around 1978. It's past 1am and all the lights in a high-rise apartment are out, except for one. A Hungarian girl — not yet 10 years old — sits on the cold bathroom floor balancing a chessboard on her knees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her father opens the door and finds her there, crying, "Sofia! Leave the pieces alone!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The girl looks up at him. "Daddy," she says almost desperately, "they won't leave me alone!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you aren't familiar with this story, the girl is Sofia Polgar. In the years following the above scene in the bathroom, she'd go on to achieve one of the highest-performing ratings in chess history, playing for Hungary in four Chess Olympiads and winning two team gold medals, one team silver, three individual golds, and one individual bronze.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot has been written about the training regimen that Sofia went through with her two sisters: 5–6 hours of daily chess practice alongside studies in multiple languages and high-level mathematics in an apartment packed with thousands of chess books and detailed filing systems of their opponents' histories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But not much has been written — how could it be? — about all the hidden reps Sofia got in outside of her official sessions. Like most elite performers, she had dissolved the boundaries of what counts as training and become high in something I call "practice surface area." It means what it sounds like: the total volume of time and space in your life where practice can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's say you and a friend decide to learn something new together. Guitar, chess, coding, whatever. You both sign up for the same class, practice for the same scheduled hour each day, watch the same YouTube tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six weeks later, they’re proficient and you’re still stuttering through the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all know the standard explanation: talent. They’ve got it, you don’t. Some people are just wired for certain things. Better to cut your losses and find something that comes naturally to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe! Usually what people mean when they call someone "talented" or a "natural" is that the person is genetically gifted. And genetics is real. But it's also not a very satisfying explanation because it's so nonspecific.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if I may, I think what's actually taking place in most cases is a difference in practice surface area. You and your friend both officially practiced for the same "3 hours per week," but in reality your friend put in closer to 30. And they weren't even aware they were doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They started hearing music differently. Every song on their commute became a lesson in chord progressions. Their fingers unconsciously worked through scales during meetings. They fell asleep running through the next day's session. They dreamed in tablature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You began practicing guitar. They began living guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like studying world-class performers, and I can’t think of a single high-level pro who isn’t also high in practice surface area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take George Orwell. In his essay Why I Write, he reveals something that should have disqualified him from ever becoming a writer: he had a terrible time actually sitting down to write. The physical act of writing was torture for him. By his own admission, he would avoid it whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how did this writing-avoidant person become one of the most famous prose stylists of the 20th century?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the secret he buried in that same essay:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For fifteen years or more, I was carrying out a literary exercise of a quite different kind: this was the making up of a continuous “story” about myself, a sort of diary existing only in the mind… For minutes at a time this kind of thing would be running through my head: ‘He pushed the door open and entered the room. A yellow beam of sunlight, filtering through the muslin curtains, slanted on to the table, where a matchbox, half-open, lay beside the inkpot. With his right hand in his pocket he moved across to the window. Down in the street a tortoiseshell cat was chasing a dead leaf,’ etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From childhood until age twenty-five, Orwell was practicing descriptive prose every waking moment. He wasn’t "writing," he was just existing lol. But his brain was secretly logging thousands of hours of narrative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern shows up everywhere once you know to look for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Richard Feynman didn’t become a legendary teacher by practicing lectures. He became one by explaining physics to imaginary students while walking around campus. He’d work through problems out loud in empty rooms, turning every moment of solitude into a teaching rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bobby Fischer carried a pocket chess set everywhere and would analyze positions using ceiling tiles as boards while lying in bed. Insomnia became chess study. Waiting rooms became tournaments. His opponents thought they were facing someone with supernatural talent. They were actually facing someone who’d turned every idle moment into chess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact I've found so many examples of high practice surface area that I created a companion piece to this essay filled with nothing but examples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here it is: The hidden training habits of 21 world-class performers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that the best way to increase your practice surface area in a given field is to be obsessed with that field. Obsession makes quick work of formal and bounded training sessions, and it doesn't need "tips" on how to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the question then becomes, "How do I increase my practice surface area if I'm not already obsessed?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've got a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify the smallest possible practice unit that requires no equipment, setup, or specific location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Bobby Fischer analyzing chess positions on ceiling tiles while lying in bed, you need a version of practice so minimal it can happen anywhere, requiring zero setup or equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waiting periods and dead time are great opportunities for visualization sessions where you mentally simulate perfect performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael Phelps would run “mental movies” of perfect races in waiting rooms and before sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Layer your craft directly onto daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maya Angelou composed entire poems while mopping floors. She claims to have used the rhythm of physical work as a metronome for her words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop automatic mental habits that keep your craft running in the background of consciousness throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eminem can’t turn off the part of his brain that rhymes everything. Every conversation, interview, even argument becomes inadvertent freestyle practice as he generates rhyme patterns for everything he hears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Convert physical limitations and situational constraints into practice parameters that force innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UFC fighter Anderson Silva would practice his striking combinations disguised as dancing at Brazilian clubs. He'd throw actual combat sequences to the rhythm while everyone thought he was just getting down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimalist software decoder with state-of-the-art performance for the H.264/AVC video format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note this is a work in progress and will be ready for use after making GStreamer/VLC plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supports Progressive High and MVC 3D profiles, up to level 6.2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any resolution up to 8K UHD&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8-bit 4:2:0 planar YUV output&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slices and Arbitrary Slice Order&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slice and frame multi-threading&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Per-slice reference picture list&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory Management Control Operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Long-term reference frames&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows: x86, x64&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux: x86, x64, ARM64&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mac OS: x64&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edge264 is entirely developed in C using 128-bit vector extensions and vector intrinsics, and can be compiled with GNU GCC or LLVM Clang. SDL2 runtime library may be used (optional) to enable display with &lt;code&gt;edge264_test&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; options for tuning the compiled library file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CC&lt;/code&gt;- C compiler used to convert source files to object files (default&lt;code&gt;cc&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CFLAGS&lt;/code&gt;- additional compilation flags passed to&lt;code&gt;CC&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;TARGETCC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;TARGETCC&lt;/code&gt;- C compiler used to link object files into library file (default&lt;code&gt;CC&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;LDFLAGS&lt;/code&gt;- additional compilation flags passed to&lt;code&gt;TARGETCC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;TARGETOS&lt;/code&gt;- resulting file naming convention among&lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt;|&lt;code&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt;|&lt;code&gt;Darwin&lt;/code&gt;(default host)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;VARIANTS&lt;/code&gt;- comma-separated list of additional variants included in the library and selected at runtime (default&lt;code&gt;logs&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x86-64-v2&lt;/code&gt;- variant compiled for x86-64 microarchitecture level 2 (SSSE3, SSE4.1 and POPCOUNT)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x86-64-v3&lt;/code&gt;- variant compiled for x86-64 microarchitecture level 3 (AVX2, BMI, LZCNT, MOVBE)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;logs&lt;/code&gt;- variant compiled with logging support in YAML format (headers and slices)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;BUILD_TEST&lt;/code&gt;- toggles compilation of&lt;code&gt;edge264_test&lt;/code&gt;(default&lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;FORCEINTRIN&lt;/code&gt;- enforce the use of intrinsics among&lt;code&gt;x86&lt;/code&gt;|&lt;code&gt;ARM64&lt;/code&gt;(for WebAssembly)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ make CFLAGS="-march=x86-64" VARIANTS=x86-64-v2,x86-64-v3 BUILD_TEST=no # example x86 build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The automated test program &lt;code&gt;edge264_test&lt;/code&gt; can browse files in a given directory, decoding each &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;.264&lt;/code&gt; file and comparing its output with each sibling file &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;.yuv&lt;/code&gt; if found. On the set of AVCv1, FRExt and MVC conformance bitstreams, 109/224 files are decoded without errors, the rest using yet unsupported features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ make
$ ./edge264_test --help # prints all options available
$ ffmpeg -i vid.mp4 -vcodec copy -bsf h264_mp4toannexb -an vid.264 # optional, converts from MP4 format
$ ./edge264_test -d vid.264 # replace -d with -b to benchmark instead of display&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a complete example that opens an input file in Annex B format from command line, and dumps its decoded frames in planar YUV order to standard output. See edge264_test.c for a more complete example which can also display frames.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;EWOULDBLOCK&lt;/code&gt;if the non-blocking function would have to wait before a picture slot is available&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;int edge264_get_frame(dec, out, borrow)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Edge264Frame *out&lt;/code&gt;- a structure that will be filled with data for the frame returned&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;int borrow&lt;/code&gt;- if 0 the frame may be accessed until the next call to&lt;code&gt;edge264_decode_NAL&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise the frame should be explicitly returned with&lt;code&gt;edge264_return_frame&lt;/code&gt;. Note that access is not exclusive, it may be used concurrently as reference for other frames.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Return codes are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;on success (one frame is returned)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;EINVAL&lt;/code&gt;if the function was called with&lt;code&gt;dec == NULL&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;out == NULL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ENOMSG&lt;/code&gt;if there is no frame to output at the moment&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While reference frames may be decoded ahead of their actual display (ex. B-Pyramid technique), all frames are buffered for reordering before being released for display:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decoding a non-reference frame releases it and all frames set to be displayed before it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decoding a key frame releases all stored frames (but not the key frame itself which might be reordered later).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exceeding the maximum number of frames held for reordering releases the next frame in display order.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lacking an available frame buffer releases the next non-reference frame in display order (to salvage its buffer) and all reference frames displayed before it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;AVX-2 optimizations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use edge264 to experiment on new programming techniques to improve performance and code size over existing decoders, and presented a few of these techniques at FOSDEM'24 and FOSDEM'25.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single header file - It contains all struct definitions, common constants and enums, SIMD aliases, inline functions and macros, and exported functions for each source file. To understand the code base you should look at this file first.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code blocks instead of functions - The main decoding loop is a forward pipeline designed as a DAG loosely resembling hardware decoders, with nodes being non-inlined functions and edges being tail calls. It helps mutualize code branches wherever possible, thus reduces code size to help fit in L1 cache.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tree branching - Directional intra modes are implemented with a jump table to the leaves of a tree then unconditional jumps down to the trunk. It allows sharing the bottom code among directional modes, to reduce code size.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;Global context register - The pointer to the main structure holding context data is assigned to a register when supported by the compiler (GCC).&lt;/del&gt;This technique was dropped as Clang eventually reached on-par performance, so there is little incentive to maintain this hack.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Default neighboring values (search &lt;code&gt;unavail_mb&lt;/code&gt;) - Tests for availability of neighbors are replaced with fake neighboring macroblocks around each frame. It reduces the number of conditional tests inside the main decoding loop, thus reduces code size and branch predictor pressure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relative neighboring offsets (look for &lt;code&gt;A4x4_int8&lt;/code&gt;and related variables) - Access to left/top macroblock values is done with direct offsets in memory instead of copying their values to a buffer beforehand. It helps to reduce the reads and writes in the main decoding loop.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parsing uneven block shapes (look at function &lt;code&gt;parse_P_sub_mb&lt;/code&gt;) - Each Inter macroblock paving specified with mb_type and sub_mb_type is first converted to a bitmask, then iterated on set bits to fetch the correct number of reference indices and motion vectors. This helps to reduce code size and number of conditional blocks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using vector extensions - GCC's vector extensions are used along vector intrinsics to write more compact code. All intrinsics from Intel are aliased with shorter names, which also provides an enumeration of all SIMD instructions used in the decoder.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Register-saturating SIMD - Some critical SIMD algorithms use more simultaneous vectors than available registers, effectively saturating the register bank and generating stack spills on purpose. In some cases this is more efficient than splitting the algorithm into smaller bits, and has the additional benefit of scaling well with later CPUs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Piston cached bitstream reader - The bitstream bits are read in a size_t[2] intermediate cache with a trailing set bit to keep track of the number of cached bits, giving access to 32/64 bits per read from the cache, and allowing wide refills from memory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On-the-fly SIMD unescaping - The input bitstream is unescaped on the fly using vector code, avoiding a full preprocessing pass to remove escape sequences, and thus reducing memory reads/writes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiarch SIMD programming - Using vector extensions along with aliased intrinsics allows supporting both Intel SSE and ARM NEON with around 80% common code and few #if #else blocks, while keeping state-of-the-art performance for both architectures.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Structure of Arrays pattern - The frame buffer is stored with arrays for each distinct field rather than an array of structures, to express operations on frames with bitwise and vector operators (see AoS and SoA). The task buffer for multithreading also relies on it partially.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deferred error checking - Error detection is performed once in each type of NAL unit (search for &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;statements), by clamping all input values to their expected ranges, then expecting&lt;code&gt;rbsp_trailing_bit&lt;/code&gt;afterwards (with very high probability of catching an error if the stream is corrupted). This design choice is discussed in A case about parsing errors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other yet-to-be-presented bits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimalistic API with FFI-friendly design (7 functions and 1 structure).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The bitstream caches for CAVLC and CABAC (search for &lt;code&gt;rbsp_reg&lt;/code&gt;) are stored in two size_t variables each, which may be mapped to Global Register Variables in the future.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The decoding of input symbols is interspersed with their parsing (instead of parsing to a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;then decoding the data). It deduplicates branches and loops that are present in both parsing and decoding, and even eliminates the need to store some symbols (e.g. mb_type, sub_mb_type, mb_qp_delta).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the help of a custom bitstream writer using the same YAML format edge264 outputs, a set of extensive tests are being created in tools/raw_tests to stress the darkest corners of this decoder. The following table lists them all, along with the files implementing them.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; When we search for the internet about an oval curve, several sites of Egg Curves and Ovals, Oval and Cassini oval are found. But there seem to be little equations of a curve near a real egg shape. So, an equation of egg shaped curve which resembles closely to the shape of a chicken egg is pursued here apart from a mathematical definition of "oval curve". &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1. Basic Derivation of Equation of Egg Shaped Curve&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; An equation of egg shaped curve (egg curve), which resembles to the shape of the actual egg more than Cassini oval etc. (continuing from the left), is obtained below. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In 2021, we received an inquiry about how to obtain Eq.(7). Certainly, the derivation of Eq. (7) does not seem to be so easy. Therefore, for reference, "the derivation of Eq. (7)" is shown.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; For simple expression of the above equation, we displace the trajectory by the value of in the direction, and we introduce the next two constant values;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"/&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;of (pink colored curve)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;and the shape of an actual egg&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; If Eq.(9) is rewritten, the following equation is led into the expression indicating the obvious relation to this enveloping circle. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; The major axis is obtained as = as strictly understood from Eq.(9). However, the minor axis cannot be obtained analytically. On the other hand, one round length of an egg shaped curve is given by &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; In the next, the plane area of an egg shaped curve as shown in Fig.2 is given by the follows with the use of Eq.(9b). &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2. The Volume and the surface area of Egg Shaped Figure in the Three Dimensional Space&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;and in the case of b=0, the volume of sphere having the radius a/2 is led to as&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;. (15c)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;As a reference, the calculation process of Eq.(15a) is written as&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In the next, the surface area of an egg shaped solid figure is calculated by the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;, (16)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;where is given by Eq.(9b), and is given by Eq.(14b).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;More detail analyses are described in "How can I find the surface area of a normal chicken egg?".&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="9"&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; Especially, the relationship between the ratio of the minor to the major axes and the values of volume and surface area of egg shaped solid figure is shown in Fig.3.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt; where condition of constant c indicated in Eq.(10) is released for the reason of the extension, the conditions of d &amp;gt; 0 and f &amp;gt; 0 are needed for giving a closed curve, and new conditions which are explained in Eqs.(29) and (31) described below are added. Furthermore, the constant b is not used in this equation because the relation of has already been used in the process of derivation of Eq.(10) described in the first section.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Two Years After Cormac McCarthy’s Death, Rare Access to His Personal Library Reveals the Man Behind the Myth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The famously reclusive novelist amassed a collection of thousands of books ranging in topics from philosophical treatises to advanced mathematics to the naked mole-rat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cormac McCarthy, one of the greatest novelists America has ever produced and one of the most private, had been dead for 13 months when I arrived at his final residence outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was a stately old adobe house, two stories high with beam-ends jutting out of the exterior walls, set back from a country road in a valley below the mountains. First built in 1892, the house was expanded and modernized in the 1970s and extensively modified by McCarthy himself, who, it turns out, was a self-taught architect as well as a master of literary fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was invited to the house by two McCarthy scholars who were embroiled in a herculean endeavor. Working unpaid, with help from other volunteer scholars and occasional graduate students, they had taken it upon themselves to physically examine and digitally catalog every single book in McCarthy’s enormous and chaotically disorganized personal library. They were guessing it contained upwards of 20,000 volumes. By comparison, Ernest Hemingway, considered a voracious book collector, left behind a personal library of 9,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes McCarthy’s library so intriguing is not just its size, nor the fact that very few people know about it. His books, many of which are annotated with margin comments, promise to reveal far more about this elusive literary giant than the few cagey interviews he gave when he was alive. For as long as people have been reading McCarthy, they have speculated about which books and authors informed and inspired his work, a subject he was loath to discuss. They have wondered about his interests and true personality because all he presented to the public was a reclusive, austere, inscrutable facade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Bryan Giemza, a scholar of literature and humanities at Texas Tech University, offered me exclusive journalistic access to McCarthy’s library and the cataloging project, what he was really offering was an unprecedented insight into McCarthy’s life and work. As a further enticement, he said that Cormac’s younger brother Dennis McCarthy would be there. “Dennis probably knew him as well as anyone,” Giemza said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Did You Know? Who was Cormac McCarthy?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cormac McCarthy is an award-winning novelist whose works often explored the American West with darkness and complexity. Among McCarthy's many awards are a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1969, a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2007 for The Road and a National Book award in 1992 for All the Pretty Horses.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I parked behind the house between a silver 1966 Buick Riviera rusting on deflated tires and a weathered red Lincoln Mark VIII. These were among the last survivors of McCarthy’s little-known vehicle collection. Dennis had sold 13 other cars, including two Allard racing cars from the early 1950s, a 1992 Lotus and a Ford GT40 racing car. McCarthy, who labored in obscurity and chronic poverty until he was 60, became a multi-millionaire later in life and freely indulged his desires and obsessions, with classic sports cars high on the list. Most of the money came from Hollywood, which turned three of his novels—All the Pretty Horses, No Country for Old Men and The Road—into star-studded movies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knocked on the imposing front door, an Indo-Portuguese antique made of teak and fortified with iron strappings, metal studs, flattened nails and small chains. There was no response, so I tried the handle. The door swung open and revealed a dimly lit hallway reduced to a narrow passage by head-high stacks of cardboard boxes on both sides. All those boxes were packed with books.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first room off the hallway—the room where McCarthy died at age 89—was now so crammed with book boxes that it was impenetrable. Scholars called it “the Beast Room.” The next room was nearly as full. One open box showed volumes about the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, country houses in Ireland, schizophrenia, African history and British antique rifle barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the dining room, underneath a beautiful hanging light fixture of wood and colored glass that McCarthy designed and built himself, scholars were sitting at the table, scanning books’ ISBN bar codes through their phones into the library cataloging software on their laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found Giemza in the living room, wrestling with an internet connectivity problem. “Cormac didn’t have Wi-Fi in the house, so we had to bring our own,” he said. Nor did McCarthy use a computer—ever. He typed out his pages on a cheap, durable Olivetti typewriter and, I learned later, did most of his work propped up on pillows in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The living room, like the house in general, had a sturdy, old-fashioned and decidedly masculine feel, but its clean lines were obscured by a chaotic overlay of clutter—mainly books, but also piles of nameless junk and hundreds of bowls, glasses and kitchenware items still in their packaging. Some of the book boxes and loose books had been moved into the room for the cataloging project, but not the rest of it. One of the first discoveries made by the visiting scholars was that McCarthy was something of a hoarder. His particular fixation on kitchenware, much of it bargain kitchenware, remains mysterious and a mark of his eccentricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second major discovery, discernible in his work but confirmed beyond doubt in his library, was that McCarthy was a genius-level intellectual polymath with an insatiable curiosity. His interests ranged from quantum physics, which he taught himself by reading 190 books on the notoriously challenging subject, to whale biology, violins, obscure corners of French history in the early Middle Ages, the highest levels of advanced mathematics and almost any other subject you can name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giemza marveled at the heavy-duty philosophy books they were finding. “Seventy-five titles by or about Wittgenstein so far,” he said, referring to the Austrian philosopher of mathematics, logic, language and the mind. “And most of them are annotated, meaning Cormac read them closely. A lot of Hegel. That was his light evening reading, apparently.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the living room was a pool table piled with books and a leather couch facing two tall windows and three sets of nine-foot-tall wooden bookshelves designed by McCarthy that held approximately 1,000 books. Moving closer, I saw they were nearly all nonfiction hardbacks with no obvious system of organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One shelf held volumes about Mesoamerican&lt;lb/&gt; history and archaeology, along with Charles Darwin’s collected notebooks, Victor Klemperer’s three-volume diary of the Nazi years, books about organic chemistry and sports cars, and an obscure volume titled The Biology of the Naked Mole-Rat (Monographs in Behavior and Ecology). Another shelf held books about Grand Prix and Formula 1 racing, a great passion of McCarthy’s, and the collected writings of Charles S. Peirce, the American scientist, philosopher and logician, in six fat volumes of dense, difficult prose. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to take it all in, I felt both fascinated and overwhelmed. It seemed almost inconceivable that an author who produced 12 novels, two plays and five screenplays had also found the time, energy and brainpower to master architecture, woodworking, stonemasonry and a wide range of intellectual disciplines. Some of his math books were nearly all equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we found an intricate drawing he’d made for an engine modification to one of his cars, and another showing how to rifle a gun barrel with hand tools. We found dozens of well-thumbed engine repair manuals and auto mechanic’s tools in the outbuildings, and learned that he could disassemble, reassemble and redesign an engine to increase its horsepower. Then I learned he had an eidetic memory and could remember nearly everything he had read or heard, including the lyrics to thousands of songs. McCarthy was starting to seem like a man whose talents and intelligence were without limits, yet he lived in a hoarder’s shambles and couldn’t stop buying nonstick skillets and fruit bowls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By studying his library more closely, I hoped to gain a better understanding of McCarthy, but it was possible the mystery of his character would only deepen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giemza introduced me to his colleague Stacey Peebles, a professor of film and English at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, and the current president of the Cormac McCarthy Society. It was Peebles who first met with Dennis McCarthy, the author’s brother and literary executor, and suggested that the society take on the monumental task of cataloging the books. The society’s mission is to further the study and appreciation of McCarthy’s work, and Peebles thought there was enough material in the library to keep scholars busy for decades—scrutinizing the annotations, tracing connections between the research books and passages in the novels, interpreting literary and philosophical influences. “If we were a well-funded institution, we’d take all these boxes into an empty building where we had plenty of space to work in, a dedicated team of people and all the time we needed,” she said. But Peebles and her small team all have full-time jobs, so the project has required a trade-off between detail and efficiency. “We can’t be as meticulous as we’d like and scan all the annotations, because we’ve got limited time and a massive amount of books to get through.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy often had a pencil when he was reading and would make tiny vertical marks next to sentences that interested him and add comments in the margins in small print handwriting. Sometimes he jotted down thoughts on slips of paper that he left between the pages. Inside The Life of Saint Teresa of Ávila by Herself, first published in 1565, we found him musing philosophically: “There is an intelligence to the universe (of which we are fractal) and that intelligence has a character and that character is benign. Intends well toward all things. How could it not?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy is known for the bleak, violent nihilism in many of his novels, so it was a surprise to see him describing the universe as intelligent and well-&lt;lb/&gt; intentioned. He was a lapsed Catholic who went back and forth on the question of God’s existence, sometimes changing his mind from one day to the next. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peebles was collecting her favorite annotated books on the pool table. One was Realism in Mathematics by Penelope Maddy. In the margins, Mc-&lt;lb/&gt; Carthy summarizes the author’s points and comments on them, frequently disagreeing. “Gibberish,” he noted at one point. It was an exciting find for the scholars because McCarthy mined this book deeply for his final novel, Stella Maris. Its protagonist, Alicia Western, is a young mathematical genius with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another of Peebles’ favorite finds is an annotated copy of Shakespeare’s Hamlet. McCarthy, who once said, “the ugly fact is books are made out of books,” borrowed and altered elements from Hamlet for his 1979 novel Suttree. It was his most ornate and poetic book and the closest he ever came to writing autobiographically. The main character is a troubled dropout who has rejected a life of privilege and responsibility in Knoxville, Tennessee, where McCarthy grew up as the black sheep among six children in a well-to-do Catholic family with strong Irish roots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was born in 1933 and christened Charles Joseph McCarthy Jr. after his father. In his youth, he was known as Charlie, or sometimes Doc, until he changed his name to Cormac as a young man, partly inspired by the medieval Irish king Cormac mac Airt. The name change was probably also a declaration of independence from his father. Charles McCarthy Sr. was an attorney who became the chief counsel for the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Cormac always characterized him as a domineering, violent man who beat him viciously for trivial offenses. (His brother Dennis disputes this description and says that Cormac was “grossly exaggerating.“)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy told his own son John, and some of his friends, that the beatings started when he was 3 years old. Readers and critics have often wondered where the darkness and violence in McCarthy’s work comes from, and, if Cormac’s characterization is true, his childhood might account for some of it. He loved his mother, Gladys, but she was psychologically fragile and frequently absent from the family in mental health institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He hated his Catholic school and loved roaming outdoors. Talking about his school days in a (rare) 1992 interview, McCarthy said, “There was no hobby I didn’t have, name anything, no matter how esoteric, I had found it and dabbled in it.” He made money trapping muskrats around Knoxville and selling the pelts, and somehow also established himself as an authority on antique American rifles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1953, McCarthy dropped out of the University of Tennessee, where he was studying engineering and physics, and joined the Air Force. He was stationed in Anchorage, where he became the radio disc jockey for the base, and started reading in earnest in his spare time. After four years, he returned to the University of Tennessee but dropped out again and started writing novels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first three, The Orchard Keeper, Outer Dark and Child of God, were gothic tales set in the rural Appalachia he knew from his youth. In lyrical prose with marvelously rendered vernacular speech, they tackled dark subjects—murder, infanticide, incest, necrophilia—while displaying a reverence for nature and folk traditions. The fourth novel was Suttree, McCarthy’s richly comedic evocation of 1950s Knoxville. These novels earned critical praise and prestigious grants and awards, but each sold more poorly than the last.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the few details we have about McCarthy’s personal life comes from his second wife, Anne&lt;lb/&gt; DeLisle, an English singer and dancer, whom he met on a ship to Ireland in 1965. Their home was a partially converted dairy barn outside Knoxville; they bathed in a lake. “Someone would call up and offer him $2,000 to come speak at a university about his books,” she once said. “And he would tell them that everything he had to say was there on the page. So we would eat beans for another week.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After leaving her without an explanation in 1974, McCarthy drifted around cheap motels with his typewriter, a pile of books and a light bulb for good reading light. In 1976 McCarthy took up residence in El Paso and turned his attention on the American Southwest and northern Mexico, setting himself the task of learning the culture, history, natural history, geology, folkways and distinctive Spanish idioms of the borderlands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to a letter he wrote, McCarthy read over 300 books to research Blood Meridian (1985), an ultraviolent philosophical Western based on the true story of a state-funded scalp-hunting gang in the 1840s and 1850s. Now widely regarded as his greatest masterpiece, it sold a pitiful 1,883 copies when it was first published. McCarthy’s fortunes changed with the publication of All the Pretty Horses in 1992. This elegiac Western, set in 1949 and 1950 in Texas and Mexico, became a best seller, won a National Book Award, and was adapted into a movie starring Matt Damon and Penélope Cruz. McCarthy followed with two more novels about drifting cowboys, then shifted course with No Country for Old Men (2005), a crime thriller that the Coen brothers turned into a quadruple-Oscar-winning movie starring Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones. Next came The Road, a post-apocalyptic father-son journey that won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2007 and was made into a film with Viggo Mortensen playing the father.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy had moved to Santa Fe with his third wife, Jennifer Winkley, and their young son John in 2001. He found the town off-puttingly liberal, moneyed and artsy, and moved there for one reason only: His great friend Murray Gell-Mann, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, invited him to join the Santa Fe Institute, serving as a sort of in-house literary intellectual. This elite scientific think tank, co-founded by Gell-Mann, brings together some of the world’s most brilliant minds to research complex interconnected systems. McCarthy had long preferred the company of scientists to that of literary people, and he delighted in the high-flying conversations at the institute. He went there nearly every day to work on his writing and kept up with all the institute’s scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy was famous for refusing to discuss his work, so there was widespread amazement in literary quarters when he agreed to do a televised interview in 2007 with Oprah Winfrey, who had picked The Road as her book club selection. Viewers saw a courteous, gray-haired Southerner with a high-domed forehead and a flashing smile. When Oprah asked if he was “passionate” about writing, he replied, “Passionate sounds like a pretty fancy word.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oprah, knowing it was true, asked if The Road was a love story to his young son John. “In a way, I suppose, that’s kind of embarrassing,” he said. She made slightly better headway on the subject of punctuation. McCarthy didn’t use quotation marks, hated semicolons and kept commas to the barest minimum. “There’s no reason to block the page up with weird little marks,” he said. “If you write properly, you shouldn’t have to punctuate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy could pull it off because he was a virtuoso, renowned for his powers of description and ear for dialogue. The Nobel Prize-winning novelist Saul Bellow extolled McCarthy’s “absolutely overpowering use of language, his life-giving and death-dealing sentences.” McCarthy’s detractors, meanwhile, found his writing overly mannered, his characters overly masculine, and accused him of relishing the violence he wrote about so vividly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When McCarthy died in June 2023, after battling leukemia, prostate cancer, dehydration and what he once called “the sheer velocity of time,” the accolades were immediate, and fulsome. Stephen King called him the “last great white male American novelist.” Sebastian Junger compared him to Mount Everest. The Guardian headlined its remembrance with a prophecy: “His work will sing down the centuries.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dennis McCarthy, the youngest of the six children, made his way through the book-choked hallway into the book-strewn living room. A retired lawyer, editor and conservation biologist, Dennis published his first novel in 2021, a spiritual Western about Billy the Kid. Now 81, he was fit and trim, with blue eyes, a radiant smile and a strong resemblance to Cormac. “He was my best friend for 70 years and a fabulous older brother who always looked out for me,” he said. “We were very, very close.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked him which authors his brother most admired. “Moby-Dick was Cormac’s favorite book without question, and Faulkner was more of an influence than he liked to admit,” he said. “He loved Hemingway’s short stories, James Joyce, Dostoyevsky and Shakespeare of course.” Readers and scholars had already identified these literary forebears, but it was satisfying to hear them confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of the many thousands of books in the house, the basement and the outbuildings, how many had McCarthy actually read? “If you exclude the encyclopedias and reference books, I would guess about 85 percent,” Dennis said. “Cormac kept on ordering books after he was too sick and frail to read, because it was a compulsion, but until that point he would read for hours and hours nearly every day. He never left the house without a book. He never left the house without a gun. Both were equally unthinkable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why was he always armed? “He was a conservative country boy from the South who understood that the world is a dangerous place.” When he was 24, McCarthy accidentally shot himself in the leg while practicing alone on a gun range in Tennessee. Dennis didn’t know any more details, because his brother refused to discuss the incident, but it was likely a quick-draw gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I asked Dennis about his brother’s reputation as a recluse, he said it was totally inaccurate. “He was very sociable and could get along with anybody. Well, almost anybody. He didn’t suffer fools gladly, or people who rushed up to him gushing about his books. But he had a lot of friends, and he loved dining and conversation, and five-hour lunches that sometimes turned into ten-hour lunches.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those friends included physicists and quark-discoverers Gell-Mann and George Zweig, the whale biologist Roger Payne, the movie star Josh Brolin, plus a bar owner in Tucson who calls himself God and a silver-tongued con man from Knoxville named John Sheddan, who appears exactly as himself under his own name in McCarthy’s penultimate novel, The Passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brolin got to know McCarthy during the filming of No Country for Old Men and was at the author’s bedside the night before he died. “It was me, his ex-wife, his son John, and that was it,” Brolin tells me on the phone. “He was telling these wild stories, about drinking wine with André the Giant in Paris, and all this stuff was coming out totally lucid, sharp, funny, inspired. Then he would go into this lost dementia and he’d be grabbing at stuff that wasn’t there. Then he’d go to sleep, and then he’d wake up and tell another story.” Soon after Brolin left, McCarthy drew his final breath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy’s son John, the model for the boy character in The Road, was now 26 and sleeping in his father’s old bedroom upstairs. He’s a licensed pilot, a composer and a musician. The first time I met John, he was coming sleepily down the wooden stairs in search of coffee. I had just learned that Dennis had emptied two storage units full of books in El Paso and two more in Santa Fe and moved the boxes into the house for cataloging. “So I’m getting a totally unrealistic picture of what the house was like when you were growing up here,” I said to John.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Not really,” he said. “This is pretty much how it was. Boxes everywhere. Piles of books everywhere. The hallway stacked up with boxes with a little path through the middle. Whole rooms so full of books you couldn’t go in there. It didn’t bother me at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was John who told me that McCarthy worked in bed—a California king with high-thread-count sheets, the Olivetti on a wooden platform with a leather pillow underneath it, and piles of typed pages, magazines, books and catalogs. Writing, McCarthy once said, was not a conscious process for him. He put a blank piece of paper in the Olivetti, the words arrived, and he typed them down. But that was just the first stage of an extensive rewriting and structuring process, and some of his books took 20 years or more to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Dad didn’t like being interrupted when he was working, or when he was reading,” John said. “‘No, no, no. I’m reading. Go away!’ he would say. But he was a great father, always there for me, and I learned so much from him. We would have these long conversations about science and history and music, and whatever else, and he was the funniest person I’ve ever met, just a natural comedian.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked John what else his father collected apart from books, cars and kitchenware. “I would say clothes were the other big one. He had hundreds of tweed jackets, hundreds of shirts, hundreds of suits that he’d never worn.” John once spent three days dragging stuff out of a room he wanted to use as a bedroom. “When I was done, I said, ‘You ever think you might be a little bit of a hoarder?’ And he looks at me and he goes, ‘Yeah, probably.’ He attributed it to all those years when he had no money.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dennis isn’t buying that explanation. “Cormac always lived in chaos, which I found fascinating because he had such a fabulous artistic sense. He could design things beautifully and he dressed impeccably, but his living quarters were always a disaster. He was an incredibly complicated individual.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cataloging scholars could only spare four or five days at a time. Then they would go back to their jobs for a few months and try to carve out another long weekend in New Mexico. The stalwarts were Peebles and Rick and Jonathan Elmore, whip-smart twin brothers who looked nothing alike, taught at different colleges and wrote academic papers together about McCarthy’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cataloging was dusty, repetitive, eye-straining work, but it was conducted with good humor and camaraderie, and you never knew what might come out of the next box. One afternoon, after looking through a batch about Cistercian abbeys, violin makers, metaphysics, meta-ontology, the incest taboo and the material foundations of ancient Mesopotamian civilization, I said, “Was there anything he wasn’t interested in? Sewing perhaps?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Nope,” said Jonathan Elmore, an English professor at Louisiana Tech University. “We’ve cataloged books on needlework and quilting.” Rick noted McCarthy’s keen interest in clothes and fashion, which could, I granted, be described as sewing-related. McCarthy was a longtime subscriber to the fashion and style magazine W, and he had annotated many of his books about menswear. In his copy of The Suit: A Machiavellian Approach to Men’s Style, McCarthy penciled his opinion of slip-on dress shoes: “disgusting.” Further down the same page, next to a sentence praising shiny-buckled monk-strap shoes, he wrote, “yet more horror.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scholars treated annotations like pieces of treasure and would read them aloud to each other. Inside Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, they found notes on a slip of paper, including a line about the assassin’s bullet: “it was going like a bat out of hell when it left the president’s head and in that crowd it is a pure freak of chance that it didn’t take out a citizen-spectator.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The historical figures who interested McCarthy the most, judging by the number of books he owned about them, were Albert Einstein (114 books), Winston Churchill (88) and James Joyce (78). Architecture is the dominant subject in the collection, with 855 books. The human being whom McCarthy most admired, Dennis confirms, was Ludwig Wittgenstein. The team cataloged a staggering 142 books by or about the philosopher, with a high proportion annotated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy’s fascination with Wittgenstein came as a surprise to the scholars, but it makes sense. As Rick Elmore, a philosophy professor at Appalachian State University with floral tattoos climbing up his neck, puts it, “Wittgenstein was always asking how the systems we use to represent the world relate to the world we want to represent. It’s one of the central questions in McCarthy’s work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the exception of Moby-Dick in multiple, gorgeous leather-bound editions, the scholars found hardly any novels until they started cutting open boxes that Dennis retrieved from a storage locker in El Paso. Out came the entire canon of Western literature, from ancient Greece and Rome to the best novelists, poets and essayists of the 1970s, nearly all in cheap, worn, paperback editions. “These are the books that he read in his 20s and 30s and maybe into his 40s, and he was broke that whole time,” said Dennis. “Once he got money, Cormac bought all his books in hardback if possible, and for the last 40 years of his life he read almost no fiction at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? The answer stems from McCarthy’s deeply disparaging view of modern society, which he considered lost, divorced from nature, history and tradition and heading toward social collapse and apocalypse. “Cormac considered contemporary fiction a waste of time,” said Dennis, “because contemporary writers no longer have a legitimate culture to feed their souls.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One afternoon, Dennis was marveling at McCarthy’s storytelling abilities and comedic talents, and I asked him if there was anything, apart from housekeeping, that his brother had been bad at. He thought about it for a moment and said, “Marriage.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy was married and divorced three times. “His wives needed more than he gave them,” Dennis said. “The work always came first for Cormac. He loved those women, but he loved himself more. He was a narcissist. And if he hadn’t been a narcissist, he never would have achieved the same heights of artistic greatness.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most enduring love of McCarthy’s life was a woman named Augusta Britt. As she revealed last year in interviews with Vanity Fair magazine, they began a sexual relationship when she was 17 and he was 43, and he took her to Mexico to evade the FBI, who were after him for statutory rape and Mann Act violations. Britt has said she didn’t feel sexually exploited and credits McCarthy for saving her life by rescuing her from an abusive situation in Tucson, but some readers and commentators have found McCarthy’s behavior with her beyond the pale. (Britt declined to comment for this piece.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy and Britt were together as a couple for about four years. Even after they split up, “He never stopped loving her,” Dennis said. “He continued to see her on a regular basis, and they maintained a close relationship for the rest of his life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Piece by piece, the inscrutable mystique that McCarthy built around himself is falling away. Two biographies are on the way to publication, one by a friend of McCarthy’s named Laurence Gonzales, the other by literary biographer Tracy Daugherty, and Britt might collaborate on a book with Vincenzo Barney, who wrote her story in Vanity Fair. We also have McCarthy’s library, which perhaps more than any other source can illuminate the mind of the man who, as Peebles says, “built his life on books.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the first day of the final cataloging session, Peebles let out a hooting sound upon finding a dead bat at the bottom of a box. The downstairs of the house had been steadily accumulating dust for more than two years, since McCarthy’s death, and it was still crammed with books. The McCarthy scholars—Cormackians, as they call themselves—repacked the cataloged books, wrote the date and “Cataloged CMS” for Cormac McCarthy Society, and stacked them up wherever space could be found. The annotated books went into separate boxes marked “annotated” or were piled up on the pool table. The dead bat was left in the bottom of a book box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the project began, Peebles had hoped that all the books could be kept together in a single collection in some sort of Cormac McCarthy memorial building, but that wasn’t panning out. Dennis had arranged for the annotated books to join his brother’s papers, which include the notes and drafts for his entire body of work, at the Wittliff Collections archive at Texas State University. The Santa Fe Institute wanted a selection of the most intellectually rigorous academic books for a small library it was planning to build in honor of McCarthy. The rest of the books were going to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where he enrolled twice and failed to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the digital realm, however, McCarthy’s library will live on as a complete entity, and the public will be able to inspect its cataloged titles free of charge. “Our goal, right from the outset, was to create an open-access database listing all the books in his collection,” Peebles said. “Anyone who wants to know what books McCarthy was reading, and whether he annotated them, will be able to log on and access that information.” The University of South Carolina Press has agreed to partner with Peebles to create a website for this purpose, and to publish a monograph by Peebles about the cataloging project. There’s talk of scanning all the annotations at some point and making them available on the website, but that is still theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost exactly a year after the project began, Peebles opened the very last box. Perhaps the best adjective for its contents is Cormackian. Peebles pulled them out and announced books about Mexican architecture and the French Renaissance court, Kierkegaard’s metaphors and the Texas Rangers, the neurobiology of mental illness, architecture and society in Normandy from 1120 to 1270, and the Gun Digest book of assault weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She was unable to calculate the total number of books because the cataloging software didn’t account for multi-volume works. McCarthy’s 36-volume history of Utah, for example, registered as a single entry. Nor did the software tally multiple editions of the same book, so McCarthy’s 13 copies of Moby-Dick registered as one entry. The total number of entries was 18,520. Taking into account duplicate copies and multi-volume works, Peebles felt confident that McCarthy’s library contained just over 20,000 books, with 2,170 annotated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driving away from the house, with the taste of old book dust in my mouth, I marveled at the extraordinary force of McCarthy’s curiosity. I thought about the books on acousto-optics and lay intellectuals in the ninth-century Carolingian Empire. The $2,200 he spent on eight volumes of Horace Walpole’s collected letters. The $10,000 in several uncashed royalty checks that he used as a bookmark in the memoir of William Faulkner’s niece. To peer into someone’s library is to peer into their brain, and here, it seemed, was a mind that wanted to know everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Editors’ note: After the print version of this story was published, this version of the piece was updated with further comment from Dennis McCarthy. Also, on September 8, 2025, this article was updated with further details about the University of South Carolina Press’ involvement in this archival project.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keyhive is a project exploring local-first access control. It aims to provide a firm basis for secure collaboration, similar to the guarantees of private chat but for any local-first application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this lab notebook, we’ll share snippets of our findings as we explore the problem space and prototype potential solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entries start from the beginning, but you can jump to the most recent post: 05 · Syncing Keyhive&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the local-first ecosystem matures, the contexts that local-first applications fill has also expanded. Local-first emphasizes collaboration, but the constraints on an application are different if you build an application for you and a handful of friends versus delivering a team-oriented product. Your data not being viewable or editable by everyone in the world is a basic requirement of applications ranging from planning a surprise party, corporate meeting notes, book drafts, and legal contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s most common access control patterns assume a central server. While cloud auth tools are forever developing, generally speaking existing tools for cloud auth are very mature. Doing access control without a cloud auth server requires rethinking the underlying mechanics of how auth works. Keyhive is an attempt to do secure and efficient local-first auth while retaining the user experience found in familiar applications like Google Docs, Dropbox, GitHub, and Discord. We believe that these are table stakes for the next generation of local-first applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen user-agency principals successfully applied to other contexts. Signal popularized end-to-end encrypted chat while retaining much of the convenience of less-secure messaging applications. We find ourselves asking “what would Signal for documents look like?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Least Surprise&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike a cloud auth system which can depend on the network to keep data hidden behind a web API, local-first runs a complete copy of the application at each replica. What are the correct bounds on access control when everyone has direct access to all of the content? Ultimately access control is about collaboration. Collaboration and access control can be seen as two sides of the same topic: who do you want to collaborate with, in which ways, and for how long?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRDTs try to merge data in the least surprising way possible. For example, concurrent text will merge to produce the same data on all replicas, but the resulting paragraphs may not make sense next to each other. Users then fix these semantic errors manually. We believe that this is a major improvement over the user experience of something like Git, which often gets stuck and demands user intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The equivalent situation exists for concurrent access control, but the stakes are higher. Preventing your friend from learning that you’re planning a surprise party, or opposing legal councel from altering your case prep are both important, and it should be clear how they will behave despite any underlying concurrency. The behavior of an access control system should be as clear to the end user as possible. Since there is no single source of truth about who can do what at any given time, the rules themselves need to be straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of Obscurity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often local-first applications today depend on “security through obscurity”. For example, by default you can write into any Automerge document that you know the document ID for. This style is sometimes called “Swiss number” or “Rumpelstiltskin” security. It works as long as the document ID is only ever shared with people that you want to collaborate with, your security is all-or-nothing, and you never want to later remove someone from a document. If the document ID leaks (e.g. someone posts it to Bluesky), then the document is world-writable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In lieu of a widely-adopted1 purely local-first access control system, some teams have tried leveraging existing auth methods by routing updates through a cloud auth server (e.g. OAuth login and auth logic in a server). Others have opted to emphasize decentralized user agency by using a blockchain to store access control policies. Both of these approaches require a network connection in order to check if an update is valid, which is not local-first. Bringing access control features to a local-first context requires rethinking how authority flows between nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we want is a system that retains the best of the above: the self-certification of Rumpelstiltskin, the power of auth servers, and the user agency of decentralized solutions. Following the definition of local-first, applications should accept updates after arbitrarily long periods of disconnection. Extending that requirement to access control means the ability to revoke access or have finer grained control (e.g. read vs write) requires tracking who has authorization to do what, and at which point in the document’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s cloud services have very mature access control features. These systems depend on a key architectural detail: they are able to rely on encapsulation by taking advantage of the network boundary. Since data is not available to read or write directly by the client, a privileged guard process is able to apply arbitrary access control rules. This process retrieves and/or mutates data on behalf of clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This power unfortunately comes at a price: since auth is on the hot path of every request — and generally depends on a central single-source-of-truth auth database — authorization at scale often bottlenecks overall application performance. And yet, an attacker that is able to bypass the auth part of the request lifecycle has unmitigated access to arbitrarily read, change, or delete the application’s data. This is to say nothing of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining cloud architectures to get that network boundary in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For local-first software to be successful in many production contexts, it needs to provide similar features without relying on a central authorization server. The local-first setting does not have the luxury of a network boundary: access control must travel with the data itself and work without a central guard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also some tricky edge cases due to causal consistency. What should happen to honest operations that causally depend on content that’s later discovered to be malicious? What is the best strategy to handle operations from an agent that was revoked concurrently, especially given that “back-dating” operations is always possible. If a document has exactly two admins (and many non-admin users), what should happen if the admins concurrently revoke each other (for instance, one is malicious)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address the above challenges, we’ve started work on Keyhive: a project focused on local-first access control. Our goal is to design and build a production ready instance of such a system which is general enough for most local-first applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To date, the local-first ecosystem has primarily used a purely pull-based model where users manually decide which changes to accept. This approach is often sufficient for personal projects: each user can manually decide which peers to connect to and which changes should be applied. On the other hand, many production contexts have lower trust, require higher alignment, and are ideally low touch enough so that it’s not up to each person in a large organization to separately and manually infer who to trust. As a rough north star, we’re keeping the following use cases in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publishing (publicly visible data with restricted edits, like a blog)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Journalists &amp;amp; activists: small-to-medium groups, high risk&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cryptography has a reputation for being slow, especially if there’s crypto-heavy code running on low-powered devices. To have a performance margin that can cover a large range of practical use cases, Keyhive aims to run efficiently over at least ten-of-thousands of documents, millions of readers, thousands of writers, and hundreds of admins/superusers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since authorization, authentication, and identity are often conflated, it is worth highlighting that Keyhive deliberately excludes user identity (i.e. the binding of a human identity to an application’s identifier like a public key). In our initial community consultations we found that there are many different identity mechanisms that developers downstream of Keyhive would like to use. As such, we’re designing the system to be decentralized and secure, and leave name registration/discovery and user verification (e.g. email or social) to a future layer above Keyhive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following are left out of our design goals:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constraining downstream applications to use a small predefined set of policies or roles&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interactive protocols (since local-first must work under network partition)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most client/server backends place data at the bottom, and compute over it. In that model, auth is just another kind of computation. Leaving access control to a central process is not possible in a local-first context. In our context, the auth layer must act as a foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Static authorization typically impacts the design of all other layers of a project. As an intuition, the storage layer will need to support data that is encrypted-at-rest, and so its design has a dependency on the auth layer. This means that since the design of an authorization mechanism may impose downstream constraints, its design should consider such potential impacts on the design of the rest of the stack. As much as possible, this project attempts to minimize imposing such constraints on other layers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keyhive (as currently designed) carves out three layers to handle this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Convergent Capabilities: A new capability model appropriate for CRDTs, and sits between object- and certificate-capabilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Group Management CRDT: Self-certifying, concurrent group management complete with coordination-free revocation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E2EE with Causal Keys: With post-compromise security (PCS) and symmetric key management granting access to causal predessesors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These three have a strong dependency between each other. Capabilities enable use to manage groups, and groups let us share keys for E2EE. We will go into more detail on all three in future posts, but in the meantime here is a very high level treatment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Capabilities and delegation form the basic access control mechanism that are known to be very expressive. In short: all Automerge documents get identified by a public key, and delegate control over themselves to other public keys. This provides stateless self-certification with a cryptographic proof. Public keys in the system can represent anything: other documents, users, groups, or anything else. This is a very low-level mechanism that can be used to model high level concepts like powerboxes, roles, device groups, and more with very little code, all while remaining extensible to new patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Object-capabilities (AKA “ocap”) are “fail-stop”, meaning that they intentionally stop working if there’s a network partition to preserve consistency over availability. Since local-first operates under partition (e.g. offline), parts of the classic object-capability design are not suitable. Certificate capabilities such as SPKI/SDSI, zcap-ld and UCAN are partition-tolerant, but depend on stateless certificate chains which is highly scalable but somewhat limits their flexibility. We propose a system between the two: convergent capabilities (“concap” for short) which contain CRDT state to get the benefits of both while retaining suitability for local-first applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concurrent access control will always have some tricky situations. The big obvious ones are what to do if two admins concurrently revoke each other, or happened if operations depend on others that were revoked, and how to handle maliciously back-dated updates. There is quite a lot to discuss on this topic, so we’ll leave it for a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groups are built on top of convergent capabilities. They’re “just” a thin design pattern, but help model things like user devices, teams, and more. By following the delegations between groups, we can discover which public keys have what kind of access to a certain document. This provides a handy abstraction over teams and user devices. By following the links, it both lets a writer know who has read access (i.e. who to share keys for the latest E2EE chunk with), and lets the trust-minimized sync engine know which documents the current device can request from the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data in Keyhive is encrypted-at-rest. Encrypting every Automerge operation separately would lead to very large documents that cannot be compressed. Instead we use the Automerge Binary Format to compress-then-encrypt ranges of changes. We expect these encryption boundaries to change over time as parts of the document become more stable, so we need a way to manage (and prune) a potentially large number of keys with changing envelope boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We achieve the above by including the keys to all of their causal predessesor chunks. This sacrifices forward secrecy (FS) — leaking old message keys in the case of a later compromised key — but retains secrecy of concurrent and future chunks. Of course “leaking” anything sounds bad. However, unlike ephemeral messaging (e.g. Signal) where not all users are nessesarily expected to have the entire chat history, CRDTs like Automerge require access to the entire causal history in order to render a view. This means that in all scenarios we need to pass around all historical keys, whether or not they’re in the same encryption envelope. We believe that this choice is appropriate for static control context on documents that require the entire history. As a nice side-effect of this choice, we also gain flexibility and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this design, keys behave a bit like pointers, so we can apply all of the standard data structure pointer indirection tricks to do smooth updates to encryption boundaries. This is fairly well-developed at this stage, so we will save a deeper exploration of this topic for a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E2EE raises a new issue: there is no such thing as perfect security. All encryption algorithms are deemed secure with respect to some explicitly-defined assumptions (such as the difficulty of factoring large primes or group operations). There may be mathematical breakthroughs, edge cases discovered, or new hardware that render your choice of encryption algorithm useless. Even more worse, keys can be accidentally leaked or devices stolen. While we can revoke future write access, if someone has the data and the symmetric key, then they have the ability to read that data. The best practice is to have defense in depth: don’t make ciphertexts retrievable by anyone, but only those with “pull access” or higher. “Pull” is weaker than the more familiar “read” and “write” access effects: it’s only the ability to retrieve bytes from the network but not decrypt or modify them. This is especially helpful for trust-minimizing sync servers, since by definition they cannot have the ability to see the plaintext if we want to claim E2EE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we want to move towards an ecosystem of interchangeable relays, minimizing trust on such relays is a must. Our approach (perhaps unsurprisingly) is to end-to-end encrypt the data, removing read access from sync servers altogether. Under this regime, sync engines are “merely” a way to move random-looking bytes between clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is another ongoing project at the lab focused improving data synchronization for peer-to-peer and via sync servers. We’ve realized that sync and secrecy strongly interact. Broadly speaking, sync protocols benefit from more metadata (to efficiently calculate deltas), but cryptographic protocols aim to minimize or eliminate metadata exposure. This tension extends across related systems, including merging E2EE compressed chunks, and determining if a peer has already received specific operations when a sync server cannot access them in plaintext.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, combining these systems can sometimes result in more than the sum of their parts. For instance, convergent capabilities help facilitate the calculation of which documents are of interest to particular agent, helping the sync system know which documents to send deltas of. For these reasons, we’re treating synchronization and authorization as part of a larger, unified project, even though each will yield distinct artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cryptographic code is notoriously difficult to debug, so we decided to start with design and move to code when we had some fairly good theories on how the basics of this system should work. Now that we’re at that point, we’ve very recently begun to implement this design. We’ll report on our progress in future posts, as well as dive deeper into some of the topics we touched on in the overview here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen in past lab notes, Keyhive provides access control for local-first applications. We support both server-based collaboration and peer-to-peer operation without a trusted server. And individuals might work offline for extended periods of time. In the context of Automerge, our goal is to control access to documents, collections of documents, and parts of documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every document has a group of users with access to that document. That group might include other groups as members (in which case the members of those groups are also members of the document). Importantly, a document group’s membership is dynamic, with new members added and removed over time. We must be able to handle concurrent changes in a distributed context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, if we want to limit read access to just our group, we can’t safely share our document as plaintext via sync servers. We need a way to encrypt and decrypt our data that is accessible to only our document’s members. This means we need a way for our group to agree on the keys that will be used for encryption and decryption over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the literature, this problem is known as Continuous Group Key Agreement (CGKA). A CGKA protocol enables a dynamic group to agree on a sequence of keys over time. CGKAs ordinarily guarantee two properties: forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS). Imagine a successful attacker compromises a single key. In the simplest terms, forward secrecy means that this key will not enable access to past data. And post-compromise security means it will not enable access to future data. If you can guarantee both, then you can limit the damage from a key compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to achieve forward secrecy is through “ratcheting”. With a ratchet, honest users employ a key derivation function (KDF) to deterministically transform a key in a way that is effectively impossible to reverse. A cryptographic hash function is one way to achieve this. Ratcheting with such a one-way function prevents an attacker from discovering past keys since there is no feasible way to reverse the function. But a one-way function on its own does not prevent an attacker from discovering future keys, since you can derive all future keys from a compromised key by repeatedly applying the hash function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, we don’t want a system that once compromised is always insecure. That’s where post-compromise security comes in. The intuitive idea is that a system with post-compromise security has some mechanism to deny access after an attack. Compromised information will no longer be enough to derive future keys. One way to achieve this is to periodically rotate information required for determining future keys in a way that is not accessible to a past attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, ratcheting protocols mix in fresh information with each ratchet so that knowledge of a key is not by itself sufficient to derive future keys. For example, Signal’s Double Ratchet protocol includes sending a Diffie-Hellman public key with each message so that the receiver can derive a shared Diffie-Hellman secret to use as a side input to the key derivation function (KDF) that is used for ratcheting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current Message Layer Security (MLS) protocol for CGKA uses TreeKEM, a protocol for asynchronous, decentralized key agreement for dynamic groups1. TreeKEM uses a binary tree with group members’ public keys at the leaves and the current group secret encrypted at the root. All other inner nodes act like the root for their subtrees (and subtrees act like subgroups with their own shared, encrypted secrets). Members can be dynamically added and removed from the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For post-compromise security, each member periodically rotates out its public keys on its leaf, which leads to cascading secret updates all the way to the root. Both updating and decrypting the root secret requires traversing the path from the member’s leaf to the root, performing log(n) operations (although there is a linear worst case under certain conditions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Keyhive’s requirements rule out TreeKEM as it stands. That’s because TreeKEM depends on a central server to create a total order of operations, and to pick winners among concurrent operations. Keyhive’s local-first model is peer-to-peer compatible and does not require such a central server. And for Keyhive, concurrent operations can be merged in long after they were actually performed (for example, if a member made changes while aboard a long-haul flight).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An alternative that is more aligned with our requirements is the Decentralized Continuous Group Key Agreement (DCGKA) protocol developed by Matthew Weidner and Martin Kleppmann. This protocol assumes a decentralized network that does not depend on a trusted central server. However, unlike TreeKEM, it provides linear rather than logarithmic performance. As a result, they target groups on the order of 100 members as opposed to MLS’s target of 50k members. A design goal for Keyhive is to target at least thousands of members2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matthew Weidner has also proposed an alternative to TreeKEM called Causal TreeKEM. Whereas TreeKEM requires a total order imposed by a central server, Causal TreeKEM only requires a causal order, which is much better suited to a decentralized network. Like TreeKEM, it has logarithmic performance (with a linear worst case) and is meant to ensure both forward secrecy and post-compromise security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Causal TreeKEM depends on fancier crypto than we’d prefer in order to merge concurrent updates in any order. It requires a cryptographic operation to combine updates at a node that is both associative and commutative. One option here would be BLS, but this is far less common than the standard options and there is not currently a great library option for Rust (the language Keyhive is written in). And we have definitely ruled out rolling our own crypto (you probably should too).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these reasons, we’ve proposed our own alternative3 for Keyhive that we call “BeeKEM”. It is closely modelled on TreeKEM with insights from Causal TreeKEM. It requires no central server and only a causal order of operations. It provides logarithmic performance (with linear worst case). And like the other TreeKEM variants, it provides forward secrecy and post-compromise secrecy4. Furthermore, it relies exclusively on standard crypto, such as Diffie Hellman key exchange and BLAKE3 hashing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section, we’ll see how BeeKEM works in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In BeeKEM (as in TreeKEM), the current group secret is stored encrypted at the root node of a binary tree. We’ll call this the “root secret”. The root secret is used for encrypting and decrypting document chunks shared with our group over the network5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each leaf of the tree corresponds to a member of the group and contains its ID and latest Diffie Hellman (DH) public key. A member’s ID is persistent over time but each member will periodically rotate its DH public key. When a member rotates its DH public key, that will cause the root secret to change as well. Thus, member key rotations help provide post-compromise security. From the point of view of an adversary, they introduce fresh randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each leaf has an implicit secret known only to the corresponding member (i.e. not stored in the tree). All other “inner” nodes in the tree contain a DH public key for that node and a corresponding secret key that is stored encrypted at the node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each node in a binary tree has a single sibling node, as illustrated in the following diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When encrypting or decrypting a new secret at a parent node, a child node performs a Diffie Hellman key exchange with its sibling. That means it will use its sibling DH public key and its own secret key to derive what we’ll call a “shared DH secret”. The shared DH secret is used to encrypt and decrypt the new secret at the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A brief (simplified) aside on how Diffie Hellman key exchange works. Imagine Alice and Bob each have their own DH public keys (alice_pk and bob_pk) and DH secrets (alice_sk and bob_sk). If Alice combines her DH public key with Bob’s secret key, she can derive a shared DH secret. If Bob combines his DH public key with Alice’s secret key, he can derive the same shared DH secret. In this way, they can agree on a shared secret just by exchanging their public keys in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use this same principle to derive a shared DH secret for any sibling pair in our tree. For example, to decrypt Alice’s parent node, Alice can use its secret alice_sk and its sibling’s public key bob_pk to derive a shared DH secret. It can then use that shared secret to decrypt the secret at the parent node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That parent secret can in turn be used for a Diffie Hellman exchange with the parent’s sibling’s DH public key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a member to decrypt the root secret, it must start from its leaf and traverse the tree one parent at a time until it reaches the root. The sequence of nodes from leaf to root is called that leaf’s “path”. At each node in its path, it will derive a shared DH secret with its sibling to decrypt the secret at its parent. Once it’s decrypted the root secret, it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the following diagram, the decrypting leaf’s path is marked in green. The siblings used as Diffie Hellman partners along the way are marked in purple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three mutating operations that can be performed on the tree: Update Key (i.e. key rotation), Remove Member, and Add Member. Let’s look at these in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every member must periodically update the DH public key at its leaf in order to guarantee post-compromise security. When we update our leaf DH public key, we must then update the secrets for all the nodes on our path, eventually updating the root secret for the entire group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before traversing our path, we can derive a sequence of path secrets by applying BLAKE3’s key derivation function to an initial secret once for each node on the path. As we move up each parent on our path, we will encrypt the next derived secret and store it on that parent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to encrypt the secret for a parent, we use Diffie Hellman key exchange as described above. We then derive a new Diffie Hellman public key from the secret for the parent, and store both that new DH public key and the corresponding encrypted secret at the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later on, when the sibling wants to decrypt that parent secret, it can do Diffie Hellman the other way, using the encrypter node’s DH public key with the sibling node’s secret to derive the same shared DH secret that was used to encrypt the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to explain membership changes, we must introduce the concept of “blanking” a node. Blanking a node means that we remove all key and secret information from that node. If the root node is blank, then the tree does not currently hold a shared group key. Some nodes are blanked after membership change operations, and all leaves beyond the last member leaf on the right are blank.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a tree has a blank root, then at least one member must perform an Update Key operation to restore a root secret. An update will replace all blank nodes on its update path with key information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we perform a Remove Member operation, we first blank the leaf corresponding to that member. We then blank the entire path from that leaf up to the root node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that if a removed member performs an update concurrently with its removal, we need to ensure that the update does not survive (or else the member will continue to have access to the root secret). When merging concurrent removes with other operations, BeeKEM ensures that the remove paths are blanked after all other concurrent operations are merged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we perform an Add Member operation, we add the new member’s ID and public key to the next blank leaf on the right. We then blank the path from that leaf to the root.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that if two members add a member concurrently to the same tree, they will add them to the same leaf. BeeKEM resolves such conflicts on merge by sorting all concurrently added leaves and blanking their paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve assumed that every node has a sibling with key information. That’s what allowed us to use Diffie Hellman to derive a shared DH secret. But what happens when a node’s sibling is blank?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, we must find the blank node’s resolution. A node’s resolution is the set of its highest non-blank descendents. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have a blank sibling, you must do a separate encryption of the new parent secret for every member of your sibling’s resolution. For each of those members, you use its Diffie Hellman public key with your secret to derive a shared DH secret. You then encrypt the new parent secret using that shared secret and store it for that member.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that if the resolution of a sibling node contains 5 members, you will need to store the parent secret 5 times, each one encrypted for a separate member.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The worse case scenario is if the entire inner tree is blank. Encrypting a new path will no longer be a logarithmic operation since every leaf will be contained in the resolution of some blank node on your path. Instead, the cost will be linear in the number of leaves: you will have to perform a separate encryption for every other leaf somewhere on your path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When decrypting a leaf with blanks on its path, you simply skip those blanks. This works because the highest blank in your path will contain its last non-blank descendent in its resolution. So when you encounter a blank on your path, you hold onto the last secret you’ve seen and start skipping. When you eventually get to a non-blank node, you’ll use that secret you’re holding onto to derive the shared DH secret you need to decrypt the non-blank parent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keyhive assumes that concurrent operations can be merged in any causal order. Concurrent updates will always have some overlapping nodes in their paths (at least the root is shared by all paths). How does BeeKEM resolve these conflicts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We must first consider our potential vulnerabilities. Imagine that an adversary has compromised a group member and their leaf secrets. They can use a compromised leaf secret to decrypt the root secret at some point in time. Recall that knowing a leaf secret means you can decrypt all of the inner node secrets along your path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If an adversary knows the secret for a leaf, it’s possible they will continue to be able to decrypt the group secret even if that leaf is rotated during a future concurrent update. This depends on how we handle merging concurrent updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we just naively pick a winner for updates to a series of overlapping nodes, then the new information added by the loser’s key rotation will no longer be necessary to decrypt the root secret. We effectively forget that information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that the winner used the outdated keys from the loser for its update (since the winner’s and loser’s updates were concurrent). That means an adversary with the loser’s outdated leaf keys will still be able to decrypt the winner’s nodes. Subsequent updates by other leaves that only intersect with the winner’s path will also fail to exclude our adversary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In BeeKEM, when merging concurrent updates, we ensure that all updates contribute information along their entire paths. We keep conflicting information around at each node until it is overwritten by a causally subsequent operation (or blanked by a membership change).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If two leaves update the same node concurrently, then they would have each written a distinct Diffie Hellman public key and encrypted secret to that node. In this scenario, we call these “conflict keys” and store them both when merging conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a member subsequently updates the tree. If a node on its leaf’s path has a sibling with conflict keys, this means there is an unresolved merge at that sibling. An adversary could have access to both sides of the corresponding fork. So it wouldn’t be secure to use those conflict keys for Diffie Hellman. Instead, we take the resolution of the node, just as we did with blank nodes. We then separately encrypt the secret for every DH public key in the resolution, again just as we did with blank nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that for BeeKEM we update the definition of the “resolution of a node” to mean either (1) the single DH public key at that node if there is exactly one or (2) the set of highest non-blank, non-conflict descendents of that node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we merged in both sides of a fork, then we know we’ve updated both corresponding leaves with their latest rotated DH public key. Since taking the resolution skips all conflict nodes, it ensures that we integrate the latest information when encrypting a parent node. That’s because any non-conflict nodes have successfully integrated all causally prior information from their descendents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means an adversary needs to compromise one of the latest leaf secrets to be able to decrypt an entire path to the root. Even knowing outdated leaf secrets at multiple leaves will not be enough to accomplish this. An honest user, on the other hand, will always know the latest secret for its leaf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a future update (key rotation), if you find a conflict key node on the path you’re updating, you can remove all conflict keys at that node and replace them with a single new public key and encrypted secret (as with normal parent encryption). That’s because your update operation is the causal successor of all the operations that placed those conflict keys. This means your tree contains the necessary information from all of those past updates, which is integrated into your update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BeeKEM’s approach comes with two downsides. First, before conflicts are resolved by subsequent updates or blanks, we must store extra information at each conflict node. Second, conflict keys add extra encryption and decryption overhead. In the worst case, where the tree is populated with the maximum number of possible conflict keys, the space cost would be n log(n) (as opposed to the best case of 2n). The time cost in the worst case would be linear (as opposed to logarithmic), as when the tree is maximally blanked. Our current set of benchmarks reflect these time costs when we intentionally exercise our worst cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BeeKEM provides Keyhive with a Continuous Group Key Agreement protocol that is well-suited to distributed local-first applications that require end-to-end encryption for groups on the order of thousands of members. It exhibits logarithmic performance in the common case with linear worst case. And it provides both forward secrecy and post-compromise security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the future, we plan to write a paper explaining this protocol and its security and performance characteristics in more detail. But hopefully this has given you a sense for how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weidner and Kleppmann argue that secure messaging for large groups does not have a plausible threat model since it would be too easy to infiltrate them. But Keyhive is designed for shared documents. In the context of private documents shared within a company with thousands of employees, for example, we would still expect access control. It’s also worth mentioning that in Keyhive, a single user might have multiple device-specific keys (each of which will count as a member from Keyhive’s perspective). ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BeeKEM in isolation provides forward secrecy, but Keyhive as a whole does not. That’s because users require access to an entire document and Keyhive is used to encrypt that document in chunks. If you can decrypt a chunk, you will gain access to the key for decrypting the previous chunk (as described in an earlier lab note). ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More precisely, we use the root secret as one input into deriving an “application secret”. It is the application secret that is directly used for encrypting and decrypting document chunks. There can be multiple application secrets derived from one root secret, but each application secret is used to encrypt exactly one document chunk. Updating the root secret provides post-compromise security by ensuring no prior key can be used to derive application secrets associated with it. We are glossing over these details in this lab note since they strictly speaking happen outside BeeKEM, which is concerned with group agreement on the root secrets. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beehive project is now officially renamed “Keyhive”!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changing names can be a painful process, and doing so as early as possible in a project’s life is helpful. As Phil Karlton famously said, there’s exactly two hard problems in computer science: caching, naming, and off-by-one errors. Naming is important for orienting readers, searching the web, and avoiding ambiguity. We wanted to make sure that the name was finalized prior to open sourcing the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a naming philosophy that says names should be descriptive, or at least present a direct “mental hook” that implies what the signified thing does. Additional puns and whimsey help with memorability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The previous project name “Beehive” was intended to present a sense of safety and collaboration: bees build complex-yet-sturdy structures together while working independently, and guard their hives to make a safe space on the inside. This metaphor was also inspired by earlier conversations with Christine Lemmer-Webber about metaphors to help explain capability systems (like Keyhive) to folks not familiar with formal concepts from the object-capabilities world like Vats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time that we decided on “Beehive”, the team was aware of namespace conflicts in the academic distributed systems literature1. Over time it’s become clear that we also have this problem with packages in more than one language ecosystem. Since we don’t want to tie the project to Automerge exclusively, prefixing the core project with automerge-* was not appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are retaining our apian naming for other parts of the project. BeeKEM maintains it’s pun on TreeKEM, and Beelay is the Keyhive-enabled relay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce that we’re opening the pre-alpha code for the following libraries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;beelay-core: Auth-enabled sync over end-to-end encrypted data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;keyhive_core: The core signing, encryption, and delegation system&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;keyhive_wasm: Wasm wrapper around keyhive_core, plus TypeScript bindings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⚠️ DO NOT use this release in production applications ⚠️&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to emphasize that this is an early preview release for those that are curious about the project. Expect there to be bugs, inconsistencies, and unstable APIs. This code has also not been through a security audit at time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last few lab notes have focused on the cryptographic components which support a local first access control system. Those being a capability based system for managing write access to documents, and a key agreement protocol for encrypting and decrypting writes (thus implementing read control). We now have to think about how to actually transfer this data between devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alongside the Keyhive project we have also been working on a new sync protocol for Automerge. The existing sync protocol works well for a single document but it is common for Automerge applications to have thousands of documents. Furthermore, the sync protocol requires that both ends are able to read the document whilst one of the objectives of Keyhive is for the server to only have access to the encrypted data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solving all of these problems in one go is the job of Beelay (the name is inspired by the idea of Beehive being the relay for all the bees (peers) in the Keyhive).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beelay is an RPC protocol which is designed to be usable over any transport which can provide confidentiality (in practice, HTTPS, WebSockets, or raw TLS). The intended usage is to create a local Beelay instance and then connect it to other peers, Beelay will then authenticate with the other peers and synchronise everything which each side thinks the other has access to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each message is authenticated by signing it with the Ed25519 key that the local node controls. To synchronise we first synchronise the Keyhive membership graph which each end has, this allows each end to determine what documents the other end should have access to. Then we synchronise the collection of documents to figure out which documents are out of sync, before finally synchroising each individual document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will be useful here to review how we intend to represent devices, people, and documents in Keyhive. In Keyhive there are two important kinds of principal: “groups” and “individuals”. An individual is identified by a single Ed25519 public key - which is immutable - whilst a group is a collection of other principals (groups or individuals) and can be updated by it’s members. One way we intend to use this is to represent a person (or more specifically their authority) as a group, with each of the persons devices being an individual member of the group. Key rotation can then be handled by adding a new individual to the group and removing the old one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groups can contain other groups. This means that we can represent as groups, where each member of the organisation is another group representing a person (or for that matter another organisation, such as a department).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another useful aspect of this structure is that documents can also be represented as groups. This allows documents to have members which can access the document. For example, a document representing this lab note might add the Ink &amp;amp; Switch group so that all (transitive) members of the Ink &amp;amp; Switch group can read and write to it. Documents can also add other documents which represents “folder” style relationships. The “lab notes” folder document (which is also a group, because all documents are) might contain all the lab notes and have the Ink &amp;amp; Switch as a member.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this all means for the sync protocol is that any given peer is represented by an “individual”. The task of authentication is to ensure that each end knows what Ed25519 public key the other end is using so that we can relate that individual key to the Keyhive membership graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One solution which might seem obvious here is to rely on an authenticated TLS session. While we use TLS for confidentiality, and the browser itself authenticates the server, our application also needs to know about the server’s public key. Unfortunately, the browser doesn’t expose this information to the application context; there is no way in the browser to obtain the connection’s TLS certificate. We don’t just need to know that a connection is secure, we need to know the public key of the other end in order to use it for access control decisions and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that each peer is represented by a public key, the simplest possible authentication scheme would be to sign each message. I.e. a message might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;type Envelope = { message: Uint8Array, signature: Signature, sender: PublicKey, } type PublicKey = Uint8Array type Signature = Uint8Array&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To authenticate a message we check that the signature is valid over the message, then we know that the other end is the individual represented by the given public key. There are two problems with this, person in the middle (PITM) attacks, and replay attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good example of PITM attack on this protocol would be a phishing based attack. Imagine an application which allows users to input the URL of a sync server to sync from. Let’s say an attacker creates a sync server at a familiar looking URL, such as wss://sync.automege.org (note the misspelling) and convinces the user to enter this URL into their application. The attacker can now intercept all messages intended for the real sync.automerge.org server and forward them on to the sync server. This means the attacker can read all the messages and even modify messages sent back to the client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem here is that the message is bound to the sender but not to the receiver. We can solve this by adding an “audience” field to the message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;type Envelope = { message: Message, signature: Signature, sender: PublicKey, } type Message = { payload: Uint8Array, audience: PublicKey, }&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t quite solve the problem above though. At this stage we only have a URL, we don’t have a public key for the server. To solve this we allow the audience field to either be a public key, or the URL we are addresssing. In this case the audience would be sync.automege.org. This means that when the PITM forwards the message to sync.automerge.org the real server can check and see that the audience doesn’t match sync.automerge.org and reject the message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works because the connection is being made over TLS, which binds the network transport to the hostname, ensuring that whoever is at the other end, they definitely control sync.automerge.org. Beelay is designed to work over arbitrary transports though, in other network setups such as P2P transports you will need to obtain the public key of the receiver out of band.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a replay attack an attacker is somehow able to intercept messages and store them, and then later replay them to the server. To mitigate this we add a timestamp to the message and then reject messages which are older than some validity window that accounts for latency plus a clock skew grace period — e.g. 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main issue with this scheme is that the clocks of two peers might be out of sync by arbitrary amounts of time. Soft locking the sync system due to clock sync issues is not acceptable. To solve this, when a peer rejects a message due to an old timestamp, the rejecting peer sends their current timestamp along with the rejection message. This allows the sending peer to determine the drift between their local clock and the remote clock and adjust the timestamps on the messages they send, and account for it during this session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To authenticate a message we check that the signature is valid, that the audience is either our public key or the hash of our hostname (or some other string which is bound to the recipient in some way) and that the timestamp is new enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we are authenticated, we need to determine what each side thinks the other should have access to. This means that we need to sync the Keyhive “membership graph”. This is the graph of groups and individuals which represent devices, people, organisations, and documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The membership graph is a directed graph of “operations” where each operation either creates a new node, delegates access to some other node, or revokes access. Unlike Automerge documents (which are also graphs) the membership operation graph is very shallow and wide, and the linked groups and documents can have cycles. There are many approaches to this problem, but it becomes much simpler if we frame it as set reconciliation, where each side has an unstructured set of operations and needs to figure out what operations the other side has that it needs (i.e. the delta between the two sets). We will encounter a very similar problem later, when we sync the collection of documents. In both cases we use a construction called Rateless Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (RIBLT) to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RIBLT is described in detail in this paper, what I will describe here are the important properties that the scheme gives us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RIBLT is a set reconciliation protocol, which means there are two peers who have some possibly overlapping set of things which they want to have the same view of. I.e. after the protocol completes each side should have the union of the things each started with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RIBLT solves this problem by having each side encode it’s set of things into a set of hashes and then generate a set of special “symbols” which one side sends to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These symbols are structured in such a way that once the receiver has received enough of them they will be able to decode the symbols into the set difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The details are a bit fiddly but the really important part is that the number of symbols which must be sent is proportaional to the set difference between the two peers. Specifically, the number of symbols sent ranges from 1.7x (for small sets) down to 1.35x (for large sets) the set difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, If we have one billion items each, but only five differing items, we can reconcile in 5 * ~1.5 = 7.5 symbols. The symbols themselves are (in our case) 32 bytes long, so we can reconcile a billion items in 240 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other important part is that the result of decoding is the set of hashes - not the things themselves. In fact, we can use any fixed length array which uniquely represents the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, we use RIBLT sync to synchronise the membership graph. The process is mostly driven by the client (in the peer to peer case we arbitrarily choose that the peer who initiated the connection is the client).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the client sends a request to the server to begin membership sync. The server stores a pointer to the current set of ops which it thinks the other end needs and then responds with a session ID to identify this sync session, and the first 10 symbols of the RIBLT sync.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The client now receives the first 10 symbols and attempts to decode them. If they are able to decode then they are done and they know the set difference, otherwise, they send a request for the next 10 symbols, using the session ID to specify which state they are syncing with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually the client knows the set difference in terms of hashes of operations which only the server has, and operations which only the client has. Finally, the client requests the missing operations by sending their hash, and uploads the symbols which they believe the server is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point each end has determine what documents it thinks the other should have acces to. The next step is to determine which documents are out of sync. To achieve this we use RIBLT sync again, this time instead of the set we are synchronising being the set of membership operations it is the set of (document ID, state) pairs, where state here is a hash of the document state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two components to the document state which we care about for the purposes of synchronisation. One is the heads of the Automerge document - the document content is encrypted but we keep the hashes of the Automerge commit graph outside of the encryption envelope, so the sync server knows the heads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other piece of state are the BeeKEM operations for the document. Recall that BeeKEM is a continuous group key agreement (CGKA) protocol which allows peers to concurrently decide on what keys to encrypt content to. We need to have the latest CGKA ops in order to be able to decrypt the document content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we form our RIBLT symbols then? One way would be to make each symbol hash(document ID, document heads, cgka ops). Then, once we’ve performed RIBLT sync we make another network call to convert each symbol into the document ID which is out of sync. However, we can do a little better than this. Recall that the RIBLT symbol is just any fixed length byte array, and document IDs are a 32 byte array. This means that instead of a hash for the symbol, we use (document ID, hash(heads, cgka ops). This means that once we have decoded the symbol we already know what the document ID is for the symbol in question without doing any more round trips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process for actually running this sync then is similar to the membership sync. Using the session ID from the membership sync the client fetches new document symbols from the server until it is able to decode the first symbol it received, at which point it knows which symbols are out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By this point we have a list of document IDs which are out of sync. We now have to sync the CGKA ops and encrypted commit graph for each document. For the CGKA sync we can use our old friend RIBLT sync to sync the set of CGKA ops, but for the document content we need to do something a bit different because we want to be able to take advantage of the bandwidth gains we get from compacting Automerge documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The set we are synchronizing here is the set of CGKA ops for the document. We use the hash of each op to create our RIBLT symbols. As with other RIBLT syncs, the client requests symbols from the server until it is able to decode it’s first symbols at which point it knows what ops to upload and what ops to request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Syncing the document content is more complicated. Initially it might seem that we could just use RIBLT sync again where the symbols to sync are the commit hashes of the commits in the Automerge commit graph. This would certainly work, however, it would use a lot of bandwidth. Automerge commits are frequently made for each keystroke, adding a 32 byte hash for each keystroke would be very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a specific instance of a general problem which is that naive encodings of the Automerge commit graph contain enormous amounts of metadata overhead. We have a compact binary encoding which reduces this overhead to around 10% over the underlying data. What we need is a way to use this data in the sync protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the current sync protocol this is not a problem, the sync server has the plaintext in memory and so it can compact the document on the fly when a new peer comes online. For Beelay this isn’t an option because the server only has the ciphertext. What to do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have come up with a simple protocol for this which we call “sedimentree”. The idea is that every so often we compress ranges of the commit graph into chunks and we do this recursively, so that every so often smaller chunks get compressed into larger chunks. We do this in such a way that older (i.e. closer to the root of the commit graph) end up in larger and larger chunks as time goes on. This forms a tree structure, with older chunks being closer to the root of the tree - hence sedimentree, with chunks being like layers of sedimentree rock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choosing the boundaries of the chunks is a little fiddly because we need to do it in such a way that peers with different sets of changes still agree on what should go into each chunk. We do this by using the number of trailing zeros in the hash of a commit as the boundary. There are more details on this here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end result of this structure is that we can sync the document in two steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download a “summary” of the sedimentree, which contains just the boundaries of the chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the chunks we don’t have, and upload the ones the other end doesn’t have&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run RIBLT set reconciliation on the membership ops&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download ops we are missing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upload ops the remote is missing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sync collection state&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run RIBLT set reconciliation on the set of document states&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sync out of sync documents, for each document which is out of date&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run RIBLT sync on the CGKA ops&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download CGKA ops we are missing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UPload CGKA ops the remote is missing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run sedimentree sync on the document content&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing which may be concerning here is the number of round trips. We should especially worry about this in the common case where only one document has changed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One round trip for the membership sync&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One round trip for collection state&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One round trip for CGKA sync&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two round trips for sedimentree sync&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should be able to simplify this. One the initial message when we begin membership sync we can send the clients first 5 (say) membership RIBLT symbols and first 5 collection state symbols. In the common case the server will be able to decode these symbols (because only one document has changed) and immediately determine which document has changed, then the server can send back a response with the sedimentree summary for the changed document and the first 5 symbols of the server CGKA RIBLT state. The client will in most cases be able to determine if any CGKA ops are missing and immediately download any missing document state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus in the common case we can sync graph updates (auth, content, etc) in just two round trips.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Biggest Semantic Mess in Futhark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original idea behind Futhark was that parallel programming (of certain problems) does not require a complicated language. Indeed, we believed that there was little need for the complexity to exceed that of the functional languages commonly taught to first year students at universities. (The complexity of parallel algorithms is another matter.) Overall, I think Futhark has succeeded at that. The meaning of a Futhark program is fairly easily determined using normal environment-based semantics; even tricky things like uniqueness types are mainly complicated in an operational sense, and to some extent in the type system - the meaning of a program (once it type checks) is obvious. This semantic simplicity is also evident in the implementation - while the compiler has lots of complicated optimisations and sophisticated transformations, the reference interpreter is largely straightforward, and quite similar in structure to how a person studying programming languages would write their first tree-walking interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will note that the above paragraph is full of words like overall, largely and fairly - this is because there is one language feature that has proven a particularly fertile ground for edge cases and implementation bugs. That feature is size types. In the following, I will explain why a seemingly simple type system feature has proven so surprisingly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Size parameters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To recap the basic idea, size types allow Futhark functions to impose constraints on the sizes of their parameters. A simple example is a definition of the dot product, which takes two arguments that must be vectors of the same size:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def dotprod [n] (x: [n]f64) (y: [n]f64) : f64 =
   f64.sum (map2 (*) x y)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is a size parameter that is implicitly instantiated whenever the
function &lt;code&gt;dotprod&lt;/code&gt; is applied, based on the concrete arrays it is passed. This
by itself is not so difficult. Sizes can easily be incorporated into a type
checking algorithm by treating them as types of a different kind - the details
do not matter, just take my word that itâs fine. (Writing blog posts is easier
than writing academic papers.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main trouble arises when we introduce the ability to use sizes as term-level variables, like for example the definition of &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def length [n] 't (x: [n]t) : i64 = n&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a size parameter is in scope, it can be used in expressions. Unsurprisingly, the value of a size parameter is the size of the corresponding dimension in some array. What is interesting is that we can access the size of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; without actually mentioning &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; itself. Intuitively, we can imagine that
the concrete value of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is determined at run time by actually looking at &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;
(say, by counting its elements), and for now this intuition holds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now let us consider what happens for a function that takes the number of columns of a matrix (the âinner lengthâ):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def cols [n] [m] 't (x: [n][m]t) : i64 = m&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are now two size parameters, &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, and we retrieve the latter. This
case is a little more challenging in the case where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is zero - as we cannot
simply retrieve a row and look at it to determine &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; - because there are no
rows. Yet an expression such as &lt;code&gt;cols (replicate 0 (replicate 3 0))&lt;/code&gt; should
still work (and evaluate to &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;). This means we need to extend our notion of how
the values of size parameters are determined, since it cannot be done by looking
at the syntactic form of an array value and counting the elements (since
&lt;code&gt;replicate 0 (replicate 3 0)&lt;/code&gt; really is just written &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;). The solution is to
extend our (conceptual and perhaps even concrete) array representation such that
an array always carries a shape with it, in addition to its actual elements.
Then intuitively, to determine the value of some size parameter, we still look
for values (such as &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; above) that have that size somewhere, and extract it
from those values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now, perhaps unwittingly, we have picked a difficult fight. The problem is that we sometimes have to create multidimensional arrays without having any example of an element! Yet we still somehow have to conjure up the right shape for the array. As an example, consider the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function, of the following
type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;val map [n] 'a 'b : (f: a -&amp;gt; b) -&amp;gt; (as: [n]a) -&amp;gt; [n]b&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The element type of the returned array is given by the return type of the function (&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;) we are mapping with. But if we are mapping over an empty array,
then &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; may never be applied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; map (\(x:i32) -&amp;gt; [x,x,x]) []
[]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How, then, are we supposed to determine that the shape of this empty array is actually &lt;code&gt;[0][3]&lt;/code&gt;? When the array is constructed, inside &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, all that is
known is that the outer size is &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; (which is known to be &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;), and that the
element type is some &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, but we have no value of type &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; we can use to
determine what the shape may be! We do have a function &lt;code&gt;a -&amp;gt; b&lt;/code&gt;, but we also
have no &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; - all we have is an array of type &lt;code&gt;[0]a&lt;/code&gt;, which clearly does not
have any &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;s inside of itâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One solution to this problem is due to Barry Jay and explained in the paper A Semantics for Shape. The idea is that any âshapelyâ function can be evaluated normally (with a value, producing a value) or with a shape, producing a shape. A âshapelyâ function is therefore one where the shape of the result depends only on the shape of the input - which rules out functions such as filtering, where the result shape depends on the values as well. This by itself is no problem to Futhark, as we only want to allow &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;ing with functions that have a predictable result, in
order to avoid irregular arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using this approach requires us to have two ways of applying a function: for value and for shape. This is a slight semantic complication, but perhaps we can live with it. But we also have to get the input shape from somewhere - and in the case of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, all we know is that the input has type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. Things could be
made to work if whenever a function is invoked, we also receive the concrete
shapes of values of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; (assuming this is possible, but because &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is used
for array elements, we know it must have a meaningful shape). But if we do
that, then why not just take the shape from &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; instead and avoid this entire
business of shapely functions?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And indeed, this is the Futhark evaluation model. At any time, a polymorphic function can inquire about the concrete type that a type parameter has been instantiated with, and extract a shape if necessary. This can then be used to annotate any constructed arrays with their full shape. Note that this is a model - the interpreter does it this way, because the interpreter is intended to closely mirror the model, but the actual compiler does not of course do it literally this way, as type parameters do not exist at run time - it just has to do it in a way that produces the same result. (In practice, it does monomorphisation.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Troubles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We didnât do it this way because it was easy. We did it because we thought it would be easy. Sadly, it has turned out to not be easy. The basic problem is that we now have an obligation to always know the full shape of any type at all times (except for those types that can never be used as array elements, but let us leave those aside for now). This turns out to require machinery more intricate than standard environment-based evaluation. The fundamental problem is pretty obvious: we need to also evaluate types along with expressions, just in case they are eventually used to construct an array, and types occur in various unexpected places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, consider a module that defines some local binding &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; and a size-parameterised type that refers also
to &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module M = {
def cnt : i64 = ... -- definition does not matter
   type C [n] = [n][n*cnt]f64
    }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual way definitions of polymorphic types such as &lt;code&gt;type C [n] = ...&lt;/code&gt; works
is that they are added as type constructors to a type environment, and then
instantiated when used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;code&gt;M.C [n]&lt;/code&gt; by itself does not have a shape, since &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is not yet known. At
some point in the future we may end up with an instantiation &lt;code&gt;M.C [k]&lt;/code&gt; for some
concrete &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;, and when that happens we can then compute the shape of the type,
which will be &lt;code&gt;[k][k*M.cnt]&lt;/code&gt;. But there is no guarantee that &lt;code&gt;M.cnt&lt;/code&gt; is actually
in scope - it may be some hidden definition inside the module &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;, and even if
it isnât, itâs difficult to go from an expression &lt;code&gt;n*cnt&lt;/code&gt; and give it a meaning
in a different scope that it was originally defined in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Futhark is a pure language, we could, as soon as we interpret the type definition of &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;, substitute the result of evaluating &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; into its right-hand
side. But this is also uncomfortable: itâs a syntactic operation, and while
substitution-based semantics are fairly common in theoretical work, they are
undesirable in implementations, because they are quite inefficient - while the
expression &lt;code&gt;n*cnt&lt;/code&gt; is small, others may also be large. The interpreter is not
just supposed to be a reference implementation; it is also supposed to
demonstrate that the evaluation of Futhark does not require any inefficient or
weird operations (even if the concrete code in the interpreter may be naive in
some cases), such as syntactic substitutions - the semantics must be expressible
via symbol-table-based environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our solution is that a type definition captures not just the right-hand side of the definition, but also its environment - that is, type constructors are closures. When at some point in the future we finally instantiate &lt;code&gt;M.C&lt;/code&gt; and
have a &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; value for &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, we extend the captured environment with a binding
&lt;code&gt;n=&amp;gt;k&lt;/code&gt; and evaluate all the expressions in sizes. This is a very strange
implementation that it took us quite a while to work out - if I had more
experience implementing dependently typed languages, then perhaps I would not
find it so weird, as it really just makes type constructors similar to
functions, which they would be in a fully dependently typed language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have had many bugs related to sizes in the interpreter (2316, 2273, 2258, 2222, 2219, 2209), including other tricky cases I did not have the heart to discuss in detail. It is by far the part of the language that has resulted in the most bugs. While we have formalised part of the size-based type system and shown it sound, we have not treated its interaction with the module system - and the theoretical formulations are generally based on syntactic substitutions, rather than environments. I hope that the current implementation, which is heavily environment-based, is fundamentally the right approach, although I have no real belief that there are no bugs left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Addendum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written after the original post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some commenters have asked why size parameters are not always passed explicitly by the caller, but sometimes have to be fished out of values. That is a good question, and the problem arises only because of language features I did not cover in the above. The root problem is that modules allow sizes to be hidden from the caller. Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module M : {
type~ arr
   val mk : i32 -&amp;gt; arr
   val len : arr -&amp;gt; i64
   
 } = {type~ arr = ?[n].[n]i32
     
def mk (x: i32) : arr = [x,x,x]
     
def unmk [n] (a: [n]i32) = n
      }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;?[n].[n]i32&lt;/code&gt; looks like a dependent pair, but it really isnât - there is no
box that contains the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; except for the array itself, and the &lt;code&gt;?[n]&lt;/code&gt; part is
just a type-level quantifier. Inside the module, arr really is just &lt;code&gt;[n]i32&lt;/code&gt;,
with a fresh but flexible &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; whenever it is instantiated, and there is little
difference to just using &lt;code&gt;type arr [n] = [n]i32&lt;/code&gt;. In particular, the run-time
representation is identical. But to users of the module, the size is hidden:
there is just a type M.arr. So if we do an application such as &lt;code&gt;M.unmk (M.mk 123)&lt;/code&gt;, at no point does the caller know that &lt;code&gt;unmk&lt;/code&gt; actually has some size
parameters that must be instantiated. Well, to be precise, during type checking
the caller does not know (because &lt;code&gt;M.arr&lt;/code&gt; is abstract), during evaluation we of
course know concretely what &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; is, but we want to avoid re-doing any kind of
type- or size-inference during evaluation, and instead stick to the annotations
left by the type checker. In this case there are none, and hence there are two
ways for size parameters to receive their values:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They are fished out of values that actually contain things of the corresponding size. This is how I usually explain the model, because it resembles how you program in language that donât have size types, and itâs fairly clear why it works.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They are passed by the caller of the function&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we did not have ways to hide sizes across function calls, then option 2 would always work. But, well, unfortunately we do. (There are also ways that do not involve modules, but those examples are even more convoluted.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also would not happen if we used conventional dependent products to represent types such as &lt;code&gt;?[n].[n]i32&lt;/code&gt; as a special kind of value, as in
dependently typed languages. This was a choice we made when we designed the size
type system - in some sense, the compiler automatically wraps and unwraps
dependent products, to provide a programming experience similar to a
conventional language. Perhaps we got this one right - that really depends on
whether the semantic mess ever becomes something that bothers the Futhark
programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
