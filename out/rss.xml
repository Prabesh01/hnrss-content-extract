    &lt;p&gt;Near the end of his first series of chess matches against IBM’s Deep Blue computer in 1996, the Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov lamented what he saw as an unfair disadvantage: “I’m really tired. These games took a lot of energy. But if I play a normal human match, my opponent would also be exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whereas machine intelligence can keep running as long as it has a power supply, a human brain will become fatigued — and you don’t have to be a chess grandmaster to understand the feeling. Anyone can end up drained after a long day of work, at school or juggling the countless decisions of daily life. This mental exhaustion can sap motivation, dull focus and erode judgement. It can raise the odds of careless mistakes. Especially when combined with sleep loss or circadian disruption, cognitive fatigue can also contribute to deadly medical errors and road traffic accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was partly Kasparov’s weary comments that inspired Mathias Pessiglione, a cognitive neuroscientist and research director at the Paris Brain Institute, to study the tired brain. He wanted to know: “Why is this cognitive system prone to fatigue?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers and clinicians have long struggled to define, measure and treat cognitive fatigue — relying mostly on self-reports of how tired someone says they feel. Now, however, scientists from across disciplines are enlisting innovative experimental approaches and biological markers to probe the metabolic roots and consequences of cognitive fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The efforts are getting a boost in attention and funding in large part because of long COVID, which afflicts roughly 6 in every 100 people after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, says Vikram Chib, a biomedical engineer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “The primary symptom of long COVID is fatigue,” says Chib. “I think that has opened a lot of people’s eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chib and others hope that a fundamental understanding of cognitive fatigue will help the billions of people who face it from time to time, as well as the tens of millions who carry it as a more extreme and chronic companion. As well as being common in long COVID, debilitating fatigue is a symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), post-traumatic stress disorder, multiple sclerosis, depression and Parkinson’s disease. Extreme mental exhaustion can also follow cancer treatment, head injury, stroke or exposure to certain toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fatigue is a really big problem,” says Chib. “We really need to figure this out — how to study it and how to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is cognitive fatigue?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the start of a chess match, a professional player might rely on well-rehearsed openings. “The first five, six or seven moves can be done without thinking,” says Pessiglione. But when there’s an unfamiliar position on the board, the player no longer has a ready routine. They are “required to think”, he says. The same is true for a driver who turns on to an unfamiliar street. On roads they’ve been down hundreds of times, mental autopilot can kick in. But if they take an unknown route, Pessiglione says, the demands on the brain intensify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cognitive control is the term that scientists give to this effortful directing and regulating of thought. Over time, as a leading theory goes, maintaining control becomes costly for the brain, and fatigue emerges. Scientists aren’t entirely sure why. Some think it is related to how cells cope when their energy supply is strained; others point to a build-up of toxins from neural activity1. But researchers tend to agree that the sensation of fatigue is protective — a warning that the brain is nearing a physiological boundary and it’s time to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Molecular players across several brain regions might be involved, scientists say. Researchers have found potential links between cognitive fatigue and changing levels of metabolites such as glucose and lactate, neurochemical messengers such as glutamate and adenosine, and a protein involved in learning and memory called brain-derived neurotrophic factor2. Even amyloid-β, a protein fragment associated with Alzheimer’s disease, might contribute by disrupting synapses, interfering with the clearance of glutamate or increasing neuroinflammation3. But it is uncertain what is a marker and what is a cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cognitive neuroscientist Clay Holroyd at Ghent University in Belgium is among the researchers who favour the toxic-build-up theory of cognitive fatigue. This idea has been gaining traction over the past five years or so, although it’s not yet clear what the waste metabolite is. He likens the sensation of fatigue to pain: both have a role in protecting the body from accumulating damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if a person ignores the sensation at first, he says, there’s little risk of real metabolic harm in most cases. “We have an automatic fail-safe,” he says. “You can work really, really, really hard for a time, but eventually you’re going to need to go to sleep.” Although taking a break from a task can offer temporary relief, sleep has a much more restorative role. Sleep, especially slow-wave deep sleep, acts as the brain’s nightly maintenance. It clears out metabolic debris and recalibrates circuits and cells so that they can best use energy reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeking better measures&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conventionally, cognitive fatigue has been quantified either by asking a person to report their own levels of fatigue or by detecting a change in their performance on working-memory tests or other tasks. These are not great measurements, scientists say. Drops in performance can be obscured by factors such as motivation, boredom and frustration. Performance can also be offset by training, such as when a chess player automates a sequence of moves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-reports, meanwhile, are subjective and unreliable. “People are terrible judges of their own fatigue,” says Daniel Forger, a researcher in computational medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who is investigating new ways to assess cognitive fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To better understand fatigue, Pessiglione, Chib and other researchers are trying to bridge an understanding of its biochemical workings with how it affects motivation4. The current hypothesis: cognitive fatigue arises from metabolic changes in parts of the brain that are responsible for cognitive control. And those changes, whether resulting from depleted energy stores or amassed waste, alter how brain circuits weigh the costs and benefits of exerting mental effort — nudging decisions towards easier options that are more immediately rewarding1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a 2022 study5, Pessiglione and his team simulated a workday by asking otherwise healthy participants to spend several hours on either easy or hard versions of the same cognitive tasks. In one task, participants viewed letters appearing one after another on a screen and had to decide whether each new letter matched one a certain number of letters earlier. Recalling whether the letter on screen matched the third letter back, for example, would be much more difficult than recalling whether it matched the first letter back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this simulated workday, participants made choices between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed ones. Those who had completed the harder tasks were more likely to opt for instant gratification. That preference was also consistent with greater accumulation of glutamate — one of the metabolites suspected to build up with cognitive exertion — in the lateral prefrontal cortex. This brain region is involved in executive functions, such as working memory and decision-making, and has been found to have lower activity after a hard day of simulated work6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matthew Apps, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Birmingham, UK, says that the dynamics of dopamine — which interacts closely with adenosine, glutamate and other metabolic players in the brain — might help to explain the connection between neurometabolic strain and the experience of fatigue. Because dopamine enhances the perceived value of rewards, it typically boosts motivation to invest effort. He proposes that sustained effort might cause dopamine levels to drop, leaving people less willing to work for the same pay-off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these and similar lines of research are starting to reveal how levels of these molecules and measures of brain activity align with fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line, says Chib, is that there is “something happening with the chemistry of your brain” that changes your calculation on whether you should exert cognitive effort. He says that baseline chemistry will differ between people: “You and I might have different concentrations of neurotransmitters in our brain, and that inherent difference could make me feel very tired, whereas you’re able to persist.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These, or similar differences in chemistry, might help to explain chronic and other extreme fatigue. In people with long COVID or ME/CFS, a small mental task can feel as intimidating as performing brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Ana Lia Tamariz, an artist and health-and-wellness coach in Miami, Florida, who has ME/CFS, simply listening to music or reading a book often requires immense effort. “Sometimes, I cannot read one more word,” she says. “Imagine coming out of anaesthesia from a surgical procedure groggy. Imagine you never exit that state.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For her, the cognitive and physical fatigue can be hard to separate. Any cognitively demanding task can make her physically drained, she says. And anything physically demanding can leave her mentally spent. Tamariz says she is constantly doing the calculation: “Is this worth my energy?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research supports the idea that some shared mechanisms might drive both physical and cognitive fatigue, and that the two interact7. “If you run a marathon, yes, there is physical fatigue in your body,” says Apps. “But by God, you’re going to feel all kinds of cognitive fatigue as well from the strain and the concentration that’s required to maintain your performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reverse also seems to be true. In a preprint from last year, Chib’s team found that otherwise healthy participants were less willing to exert physical effort after performing a mentally taxing task8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other researchers are studying the roles of stress, sleep, circadian rhythms and inflammation in cognitive fatigue, as well as the consequences. When the brain doesn’t get restorative sleep, small clusters of neurons can go briefly offline. These local sleep-like episodes can cause momentary lapses in attention and other slips in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Useful patterns for building HTML tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10th December 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve started using the term HTML tools to refer to HTML applications that I’ve been building which combine HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in a single file and use them to provide useful functionality. I have built over 150 of these in the past two years, almost all of them written by LLMs. This article presents a collection of useful patterns I’ve discovered along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, some examples to show the kind of thing I’m talking about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;svg-render renders SVG code to downloadable JPEGs or PNGs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pypi-changelog lets you generate (and copy to clipboard) diffs between different PyPI package releases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bluesky-thread provides a nested view of a discussion thread on Bluesky.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are some of my recent favorites. I have dozens more like this that I use on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can explore my collection on tools.simonwillison.net—the by month view is useful for browsing the entire collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to see the code and prompts, almost all of the examples in this post include a link in their footer to “view source” on GitHub. The GitHub commits usually contain either the prompt itself or a link to the transcript used to create the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The anatomy of an HTML tool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prototype with Artifacts or Canvas&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Switch to a coding agent for more complex projects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Load dependencies from CDNs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Host them somewhere else&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Take advantage of copy and paste&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build debugging tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persist state in the URL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use localStorage for secrets or larger state&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collect CORS-enabled APIs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLMs can be called directly via CORS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t be afraid of opening files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can offer downloadable files too&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pyodide can run Python code in the browser&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WebAssembly opens more possibilities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remix your previous tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Record the prompt and transcript&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go forth and build&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The anatomy of an HTML tool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the characteristics I have found to be most productive in building tools of this nature:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A single file: inline JavaScript and CSS in a single HTML file means the least hassle in hosting or distributing them, and crucially means you can copy and paste them out of an LLM response.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avoid React, or anything with a build step. The problem with React is that JSX requires a build step, which makes everything massively less convenient. I prompt “no react” and skip that whole rabbit hole entirely.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Load dependencies from a CDN. The fewer dependencies the better, but if there’s a well known library that helps solve a problem I’m happy to load it from CDNjs or jsdelivr or similar.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep them small. A few hundred lines means the maintainability of the code doesn’t matter too much: any good LLM can read them and understand what they’re doing, and rewriting them from scratch with help from an LLM takes just a few minutes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end result is a few hundred lines of code that can be cleanly copied and pasted into a GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Prototype with Artifacts or Canvas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easiest way to build one of these tools is to start in ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini. All three have features where they can write a simple HTML+JavaScript application and show it to you directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude calls this “Artifacts”, ChatGPT and Gemini both call it “Canvas”. Claude has the feature enabled by default, ChatGPT and Gemini may require you to toggle it on in their “tools” menus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try this prompt in Gemini or ChatGPT:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Build a canvas that lets me paste in JSON and converts it to YAML. No React.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or this prompt in Claude:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Build an artifact that lets me paste in JSON and converts it to YAML. No React.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I always add “No React” to these prompts, because otherwise they tend to build with React, resulting in a file that is harder to copy and paste out of the LLM and use elsewhere. I find that attempts which use React take longer to display (since they need to run a build step) and are more likely to contain crashing bugs for some reason, especially in ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All three tools have “share” links that provide a URL to the finished application. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ChatGPT JSON to YAML Canvas made with GPT-5.1 Thinking—here’s the full ChatGPT transcript&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude JSON to YAML Artifact made with Claude Opus 4.5—here’s the full Claude transcript&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gemini JSON to YAML Canvas made with Gemini 3 Pro—here’s the full Gemini transcript&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Switch to a coding agent for more complex projects&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding agents such as Claude Code and Codex CLI have the advantage that they can test the code themselves while they work on it using tools like Playwright. I often upgrade to one of those when I’m working on something more complicated, like my Bluesky thread viewer tool shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also frequently use asynchronous coding agents like Claude Code for web to make changes to existing tools. I shared a video about that in Building a tool to copy-paste share terminal sessions using Claude Code for web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code for web and Codex Cloud run directly against my simonw/tools repo, which means they can publish or upgrade tools via Pull Requests (here are dozens of examples) without me needing to copy and paste anything myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Load dependencies from CDNs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any time I use an additional JavaScript library as part of my tool I like to load it from a CDN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three major LLM platforms support specific CDNs as part of their Artifacts or Canvas features, so often if you tell them “Use PDF.js” or similar they’ll be able to compose a URL to a CDN that’s on their allow-list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you’ll need to go and look up the URL on cdnjs or jsDelivr and paste it into the chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CDNs like these have been around for long enough that I’ve grown to trust them, especially for URLs that include the package version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternative to CDNs is to use npm and have a build step for your projects. I find this reduces my productivity at hacking on individual tools and makes it harder to self-host them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Host them somewhere else&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t like leaving my HTML tools hosted by the LLM platforms themselves for a couple of reasons. First, LLM platforms tend to run the tools inside a tight sandbox with a lot of restrictions. They’re often unable to load data or images from external URLs, and sometimes even features like linking out to other sites are disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end-user experience often isn’t great either. They show warning messages to new users, often take additional time to load and delight in showing promotions for the platform that was used to create the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re also not as reliable as other forms of static hosting. If ChatGPT or Claude are having an outage I’d like to still be able to access the tools I’ve created in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being able to easily self-host is the main reason I like insisting on “no React” and using CDNs for dependencies—the absence of a build step makes hosting tools elsewhere a simple case of copying and pasting them out to some other provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My preferred provider here is GitHub Pages because I can paste a block of HTML into a file on github.com and have it hosted on a permanent URL a few seconds later. Most of my tools end up in my simonw/tools repository which is configured to serve static files at tools.simonwillison.net.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Take advantage of copy and paste&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most useful input/output mechanisms for HTML tools comes in the form of copy and paste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I frequently build tools that accept pasted content, transform it in some way and let the user copy it back to their clipboard to paste somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy and paste on mobile phones is fiddly, so I frequently include “Copy to clipboard” buttons that populate the clipboard with a single touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most operating system clipboards can carry multiple formats of the same copied data. That’s why you can paste content from a word processor in a way that preserves formatting, but if you paste the same thing into a text editor you’ll get the content with formatting stripped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These rich copy operations are available in JavaScript paste events as well, which opens up all sorts of opportunities for HTML tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hacker-news-thread-export lets you paste in a URL to a Hacker News thread and gives you a copyable condensed version of the entire thread, suitable for pasting into an LLM to get a useful summary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;paste-rich-text lets you copy from a page and paste to get the HTML—particularly useful on mobile where view-source isn’t available.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;alt-text-extractor lets you paste in images and then copy out their alt text.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Build debugging tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key to building interesting HTML tools is understanding what’s possible. Building custom debugging tools is a great way to explore these options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clipboard-viewer is one of my most useful. You can paste anything into it (text, rich text, images, files) and it will loop through and show you every type of paste data that’s available on the clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was key to building many of my other tools, because it showed me the invisible data that I could use to bootstrap other interesting pieces of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More debugging examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; keyboard-debug shows the keys (and &lt;code&gt;KeyCode&lt;/code&gt;values) currently being held down.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;cors-fetch reveals if a URL can be accessed via CORS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;exif displays EXIF data for a selected photo.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Persist state in the URL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTML tools may not have access to server-side databases for storage but it turns out you can store a lot of state directly in the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like this for tools I may want to bookmark or share with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;icon-editor is a custom 24x24 icon editor I built to help hack on icons for the GitHub Universe badge. It persists your in-progress icon design in the URL so you can easily bookmark and share it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Use localStorage for secrets or larger state&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The localStorage browser API lets HTML tools store data persistently on the user’s device, without exposing that data to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use this for larger pieces of state that don’t fit comfortably in a URL, or for secrets like API keys which I really don’t want anywhere near my server —even static hosts might have server logs that are outside of my influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;word-counter is a simple tool I built to help me write to specific word counts, for things like conference abstract submissions. It uses localStorage to save as you type, so your work isn’t lost if you accidentally close the tab.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;render-markdown uses the same trick—I sometimes use this one to craft blog posts and I don’t want to lose them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; haiku is one of a number of LLM demos I’ve built that request an API key from the user (via the &lt;code&gt;prompt()&lt;/code&gt;function) and then store that in&lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt;. This one uses Claude Haiku to write haikus about what it can see through the user’s webcam.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Collect CORS-enabled APIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CORS stands for Cross-origin resource sharing. It’s a relatively low-level detail which controls if JavaScript running on one site is able to fetch data from APIs hosted on other domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;APIs that provide open CORS headers are a goldmine for HTML tools. It’s worth building a collection of these over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some I like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;iNaturalist for fetching sightings of animals, including URLs to photos&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PyPI for fetching details of Python packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GitHub because anything in a public repository in GitHub has a CORS-enabled anonymous API for fetching that content from the raw.githubusercontent.com domain, which is behind a caching CDN so you don’t need to worry too much about rate limits or feel guilty about adding load to their infrastructure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bluesky for all sorts of operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mastodon has generous CORS policies too, as used by applications like phanpy.social&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub Gists are a personal favorite here, because they let you build apps that can persist state to a permanent Gist through making a cross-origin API call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;species-observation-map uses iNaturalist to show a map of recent sightings of a particular species.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; zip-wheel-explorer fetches a &lt;code&gt;.whl&lt;/code&gt;file for a Python package from PyPI, unzips it (in browser memory) and lets you navigate the files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;github-issue-to-markdown fetches issue details and comments from the GitHub API (including expanding any permanent code links) and turns them into copyable Markdown.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;terminal-to-html can optionally save the user’s converted terminal session to a Gist.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bluesky-quote-finder displays quotes of a specified Bluesky post, which can then be sorted by likes or by time.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;LLMs can be called directly via CORS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All three of OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini offer JSON APIs that can be accessed via CORS directly from HTML tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately you still need an API key, and if you bake that key into your visible HTML anyone can steal it and use to rack up charges on your account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; secrets pattern to store API keys for these services. This sucks from a user experience perspective—telling users to go and create an API key and paste it into a tool is a lot of friction—but it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;haiku uses the Claude API to write a haiku about an image from the user’s webcam.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;openai-audio-output generates audio speech using OpenAI’s GPT-4o audio API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;gemini-bbox demonstrates Gemini 2.5’s ability to return complex shaped image masks for objects in images, see Image segmentation using Gemini 2.5.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Don’t be afraid of opening files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need to upload a file to a server in order to make use of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type="file"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. JavaScript can access the content of that file directly, which opens up a wealth of opportunities for useful functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; ocr is the first tool I built for my collection, described in Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser. It uses &lt;code&gt;PDF.js&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Tesseract.js&lt;/code&gt;to allow users to open a PDF in their browser which it then converts to an image-per-page and runs through OCR.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;social-media-cropper lets you open (or paste in) an existing image and then crop it to common dimensions needed for different social media platforms—2:1 for Twitter and LinkedIn, 1.4:1 for Substack etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; ffmpeg-crop lets you open and preview a video file in your browser, drag a crop box within it and then copy out the &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;command needed to produce a cropped copy on your own machine.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;You can offer downloadable files too&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An HTML tool can generate a file for download without needing help from a server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JavaScript library ecosystem has a huge range of packages for generating files in all kinds of useful formats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;svg-render lets the user download the PNG or JPEG rendered from an SVG.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;social-media-cropper does the same for cropped images.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;open-sauce-2025 is my alternative schedule for a conference that includes a downloadable ICS file for adding the schedule to your calendar. See Vibe scraping and vibe coding a schedule app for Open Sauce 2025 entirely on my phone for more on that project.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Pyodide can run Python code in the browser&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pyodide is a distribution of Python that’s compiled to WebAssembly and designed to run directly in browsers. It’s an engineering marvel and one of the most underrated corners of the Python world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also cleanly loads from a CDN, which means there’s no reason not to use it in HTML tools!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even better, the Pyodide project includes micropip—a mechanism that can load extra pure-Python packages from PyPI via CORS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pyodide-bar-chart demonstrates running Pyodide, Pandas and matplotlib to render a bar chart directly in the browser.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;numpy-pyodide-lab is an experimental interactive tutorial for Numpy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;apsw-query demonstrates the APSW SQLite library running in a browser, using it to show EXPLAIN QUERY plans for SQLite queries.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;WebAssembly opens more possibilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pyodide is possible thanks to WebAssembly. WebAssembly means that a vast collection of software originally written in other languages can now be loaded in HTML tools as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Squoosh.app was the first example I saw that convinced me of the power of this pattern—it makes several best-in-class image compression libraries available directly in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve used WebAssembly for a few of my own tools:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ocr uses the pre-existing Tesseract.js WebAssembly port of the Tesseract OCR engine.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sloccount is a port of David Wheeler’s Perl and C SLOCCount utility to the browser, using a big ball of WebAssembly duct tape. More details here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;micropython is my experiment using @micropython/micropython-webassembly-pyscript from NPM to run Python code with a smaller initial download than Pyodide.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Remix your previous tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage of having a single public collection of 100+ tools is that it’s easy for my LLM assistants to recombine them in interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I’ll copy and paste a previous tool into the context, but when I’m working with a coding agent I can reference them by name—or tell the agent to search for relevant examples before it starts work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source code of any working tool doubles as clear documentation of how something can be done, including patterns for using editing libraries. An LLM with one or two existing tools in their context is much more likely to produce working code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built pypi-changelog by telling Claude Code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Look at the pypi package explorer tool&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, after it had found and read the source code for zip-wheel-explorer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Build a new tool pypi-changelog.html which uses the PyPI API to get the wheel URLs of all available versions of a package, then it displays them in a list where each pair has a "Show changes" clickable in between them - clicking on that fetches the full contents of the wheels and displays a nicely rendered diff representing the difference between the two, as close to a standard diff format as you can get with JS libraries from CDNs, and when that is displayed there is a "Copy" button which copies that diff to the clipboard&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the full transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser for another detailed example of remixing tools to create something new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Record the prompt and transcript&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like keeping (and publishing) records of everything I do with LLMs, to help me grow my skills at using them over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For HTML tools I built by chatting with an LLM platform directly I use the “share” feature for those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Claude Code or Codex CLI or other coding agents I copy and paste the full transcript from the terminal into my terminal-to-html tool and share that using a Gist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In either case I include links to those transcripts in the commit message when I save the finished tool to my repository. You can see those in my tools.simonwillison.net colophon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Go forth and build&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve had so much fun exploring the capabilities of LLMs in this way over the past year and a half, and building tools in this way has been invaluable in helping me understand both the potential for building tools with HTML and the capabilities of the LLMs that I’m building them with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in starting your own collection I highly recommend it! All you need to get started is a free GitHub repository with GitHub Pages enabled (Settings -&amp;gt; Pages -&amp;gt; Source -&amp;gt; Deploy from a branch -&amp;gt; main) and you can start copying in &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; pages generated in whatever manner you like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonus transcript: Here’s how I used Claude Code and shot-scraper to add the screenshots to this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More recent articles&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46223882</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 21:08:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Show HN: I made a spreadsheet where formulas also update backwards</title><link>https://victorpoughon.github.io/bidicalc/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="fd158142d221db5"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;bidicalc&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any normal spreadsheet, when you change values that are the input to some formulas, the outputs are automatically updated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could it also work the other way? What if you could also change the output, and have the inputs be updated to match the formula?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past few months I've been &lt;del&gt;obsessed&lt;/del&gt; really curious about this idea. But there were so many questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Would it even be possible at all?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Could it work with very complex formulas? With exponents? With advanced math functions like &lt;code&gt;log()&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;abs()&lt;/code&gt;, etc?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How would the UX work? In a normal spreadsheet, when you click on a cell that has a formula, you get to change the formula's expression. I would need a way to let the user change either the formula's expression or the cell's numeric value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What should happen if there are multiple possible solutions? Like in the example above, if you set &lt;code&gt;A3&lt;/code&gt;to 100, should the result be 50/50, 20/80, -10000/10100? When there is a infinite number of possible solutions, how to pick one?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Could it work with chained formulas? Could I build a long chain of formulas, update the final value and find the matching inputs all the way backwards?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, now let's just skip to the good part! Today I'm happy to introduce:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;User guide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Type of cells&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variables&lt;lb/&gt; A simple number entered in a cell is a variable: &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt;. It may be changed by the solver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constant&lt;lb/&gt; A number prefixed by a hash &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; is a constant. It will not be changed by the solver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text&lt;lb/&gt; Cells can be in text mode. To input text, wrap in double quotes: &lt;code&gt;"Distance (km)"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Formula&lt;lb/&gt; Formulas can be entered in a cell (the traditional &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; prefix is optional), for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A1 + A2
A1 + A2*(A3 - A1)^2
exp(A1)
#A1 + H5 * #H6
cos(2*pi())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result of formulas will be automatically updated when an input they depend on changes. This is the usual forward update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The magic of bidicalc is that once a formula has been computed, you can change the result. Bidicalc will walk "upstream" to change variable cells so that the formula's result matches the change you made. This is the backward update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TIP&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To change a cell formula's expression instead of its result, click on the F icon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Supported functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arithmetic operators: addition &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, subtraction&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, multiplication&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, division&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, exponentiation&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqrt(x)&lt;/code&gt;: square root of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pow(a, b)&lt;/code&gt;: exponentiation,&lt;mjx-container&gt;raised to the power of&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pi()&lt;/code&gt;: the&lt;mjx-container&gt;constant&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;abs(x)&lt;/code&gt;: absolute value of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;log(x)&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ln(x)&lt;/code&gt;: natural logarithm of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;exp(x)&lt;/code&gt;: exponential, the value of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;cos(x)&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;sin(x)&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;tan(x)&lt;/code&gt;: cosine / sine / tangent&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + &amp;lt;arrows&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Navigate the grid&lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; - Move down&lt;code&gt;Shift-Enter&lt;/code&gt; - Move up&lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; - Move right&lt;code&gt;Shift-Tab&lt;/code&gt; - Move left&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The backwards solver&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solver will try its best to find a solution. However it can fail in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This is a bug and should not happen: please report it on GitHub, thank you!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The solver reports "no solution", but there is one. This could be a bug in the solver, or you have found a particularly difficult root finding problem that has solutions that are very difficult to find using floating point arithmetic. Please report it on GitHub so I can use it to improve the solver 😃&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is technically correct but unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This can happen for a large class of problems, typically when there are a lot of free variables (the problem is heavily underdetermined) and the solution manifold is weird. For example, try to solve&lt;code&gt;a*b*c = 1&lt;/code&gt;to see this in action. To combat this, you can:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Set some variables to constants using the hash syntax, i.e.: &lt;code&gt;#50&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Reformulate the problem with fewer free variables.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Wait for me to implement more features like domain restrictions of variables.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Suggest improvements to the open-source solver on GitHub.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set some variables to constants using the hash syntax, i.e.: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DANGER&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind this is an experiment I made for fun because I like math and spreadsheets. If you need to do root finding to compute the load tolerance of a one milion ton suspended bridge please don't use bidicalc 😄&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How does it work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even a normal spreadsheet is fairly complex beast. But the novel thing about bidicalc is the backwards solver. Mathematically, updating a spreadsheet "backward" is a (potentially underdetermined) root finding problem, because we are trying to find a vector of unknowns &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual root-finding solver is a custom algorithm that I made. It a general purpose algorithm that will find one root of any continuous-almost-everywhere function for which a complete syntactic expression is known. It uses a mix of continuous constraint propagation on interval union arithmetic , directional Newton's method and dichotomic search. It is of course limited by floating point precision and available computation time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bidicalc is written in TypeScript and entirely open-source under the AGPL licence. This means that you can freely reuse, modify, and share bidicalc as long as you make the complete source code of your modified version available under the same licence. If you are interested in buying bidicalc under a different licence please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't taken the time to write a full deep-dive mathematical explanation of how it works, but if you are interested in that please let me know. I might find some time to do it if there is interest from fellow math nerds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I kept improving bidicalc until it was perfect I would have never released it. So currently it is imperfect and could be improved in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Domain restriction for variables. Currently the solver may assign any value in the interval &lt;mjx-container&gt;. I'd like to add special syntax so that variable cells can be restricted by the user to a specific interval. This would allow guiding the solver and saying that you only want this cell to be positive, of to be between 1 and 100, for example.&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solver improvements. The algorithm works well enough for simple problems so I'm happy to publish in this current state, but could always be improved. There are a milion ways to improve it in the future so that it finds better solutions, particularly for highly underdetermined cases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;float64 gradients support. Due to a pretty obscure technical limitation of tensorflowjs (that I use to compute gradients), the backward solver is partially limited to single precision, even though the forward solver uses double precision via native JS numbers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UX improvements. I am not very good at front-end dev 😄. I have learned vuejs to be able to make the UX for bidicalc but I'm not great at it. A spreadsheet interface is actually a massive state machine of complex and subtle behavior, it's a very interesting project and tricky to get right. As you can see, I've decided to skip the usual spreadsheet design principle that cells have two selection states: soft selected which enables dragging, selection, etc. and hard selected which enables changing the content of the cell. bidicalc is simply a CSS grid of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;elements.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Move cell computation off the main thread. The solver is single threaded and happens in the UI thread. It should be moved to a web worker to avoid locking the UI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About me&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My name is Victor Poughon, I enjoy math and open-source software. If you want to see me do more stuff like this consider sponsoring me on GitHub or Buying me a coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Is the Nicest Thing A Stranger Has Ever Done for You?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So there I was, pedaling my bicycle as fast as I could down a long, straight stretch of road, feeling great. I'd just discovered the pleasures of riding a road bike, and I loved every minute that I could get away. Always a data geek, I tracked my mileage, average speed, heart rate, etc. It was a beautiful Indian summer Sunday afternoon in September. I was in my late 30s, still a baby. Out of nowhere, my chain came off right in the middle of the sprint I was timing. In true masculine fashion, I threw a fit, cursing and hitting the brakes as hard as I could. At this point, I found out that experienced riders don't do that because I flew right over the handlebars, landing on the pavement amid speeding cars. I momentarily lost consciousness, and when I regained my senses, I knew I'd screwed up badly. The pain in my shoulder was nauseating. I couldn't move my arm, and I had to just roll off the road onto the shoulder. I just lay there, hurting, unable to think clearly. Within seconds, it seemed, a man materialized beside me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was exceptionally calm. He didn't ask me if I was OK, since I clearly wasn't. It was obvious that he knew what he was doing. He made certain I could breathe, paused long enough to dial 911, and then started pulling stuff out of a medical bag (WTF?) to clean the extensive road rash I had. In a minute, he asked for my home phone number so he could call my wife to let her know I was going to be riding in an ambulance to the hospital. He told her he was an emergency room doctor who just happened to be right behind me when I crashed. He explained that he would stay with me until the medics arrived and that he would call ahead to make sure one of the doctors on duty would "take good care of me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he hung up, he asked me if I'd heard the conversation. I told him that I had and that I couldn't believe how lucky I was under the circumstances. He agreed. To keep my mind off the pain, he just kept chatting, telling me that because I was arriving by ambulance, I'd be treated immediately. He told me that I'd be getting the "good drugs" to take care of the pain. That sounded awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't remember telling him goodbye. I certainly didn't ask him his name or find out anything about him. He briefed the EMTs when they arrived and stood there until the ambulance doors closed. The ER was indeed ready for me when the ambulance got there. They treated me like a VIP. I got some Dilaudid for the pain, and it was indeed the good stuff. They covered the road rash with Tegaderm and took x-rays, which revealed that I'd torn my collarbone away from my shoulder blade. That was going to require a couple of surgeries and lots of physical therapy. I had a concussion and was glad that I had a helmet on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this happened almost 25 years ago. I've had plenty of other bike wrecks, but that remains the worst one. My daughter is a nurse, and she's like a magnet for car crashes, having stopped multiple times to render aid. She doesn't do it with a smile on her face, though; emergency medicine isn't her gig, and if anyone asks her if she's a doctor, her stock answer is "I'm a YMCA member."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The guy who helped me that day was an absolute angel. I have no idea what I would have done without him. I didn't even have a cell phone at the time. But he was there at a time when I couldn't have needed him any more badly. He helped me and then got in his car and completed his trip. I think of that day often, especially when the American medical system makes me mad, which happens regularly these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed the kindness of a lot of strangers over the years, particularly during the long hike my wife and I did for our honeymoon (2,186 miles) when we hitchhiked to a town in NJ in the rain and got a ride from the first car to pass. Another time, in Connecticut, a man gave us a $100 bill and told us to have a nice dinner at the restaurant atop Mt. Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts. In Virginia, a moth flew into my wife's ear, and I mean all the way into her ear until it was bumping into her eardrum. We hiked several miles to the road and weren't there for a minute before a man stopped and took us to urgent care, 30 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you get down in the dumps, I hope you have some memories like that to look back on, to restore your faith in humanity. There are a lot of really good people in the world.&lt;lb/&gt;Enjoyed it? Please upvote 👇&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Robots designed for the era of AI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our mission is to free humans from physical labor with robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We imagine a future where robots handle the essential, repetitive work and humans are free to create, connect, and pursue what truly matters to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build that future we’re starting from the ground up with hardware. Our first product is a California-designed and assembled humanoid arm. Surrounding it, we’re developing advanced controls, intuitive data collection, and a full AI stack that makes deployment effortless in real industrial environments. We’re proving it on our own assembly line first.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are your best options</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/the-ars-technica-guide-to-dumb-tvs/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="a7ccd93c51a39178"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smart TVs can feel like a dumb choice if you’re looking for privacy, reliability, and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s TVs and streaming sticks are usually loaded up with advertisements and user tracking, making offline TVs seem very attractive. But ever since smart TV operating systems began making money, “dumb” TVs have been hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response, we created this non-smart TV guide that includes much more than dumb TVs. Since non-smart TVs are so rare, this guide also breaks down additional ways to watch TV and movies online and locally without dealing with smart TVs’ evolution toward software-centric features and snooping. We’ll discuss a range of options suitable for various budgets, different experience levels, and different rooms in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our best recommendation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a dumb TV guide, but first, let’s briefly highlight the best recommendation for most people: Take your TV offline and plug in an Apple TV box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Apple TV lets you replace smart TV software with Apple’s cleaner tvOS, and it’s more intuitive than using most smart TVs and other streaming devices. Apple’s tvOS usually runs faster and more reliably, and it isn’t riddled with distracting ads or recommendations. And there’s virtually no learning curve for family members or visitors, something that can’t always be said for DIY alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critically, Apple TV boxes are also an easy recommendation on the privacy front. The setup process makes it simple for anyone to ensure that the device is using relatively minimal user tracking. You’re likely to use an Apple TV box with the Apple TV app or with an Apple account, which means sending some data to Apple. But Apple has a better reputation for keeping user information in-house, and Apple TV boxes don’t have automatic content recognition (ACR).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a complete VR setup from scratch to let rats play DOOM. The system includes a motion-tracked treadmill ball, a panoramic headset, an input trigger, and a reward circuit. All hardware and software components are open sourced, including 3D-printable designs, circuit diagrams, firmware, and control software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first version (v1) was built in New York by Viktor, who trained rats to walk through a corridor in DOOM using a simpler rig. That version was featured on Vice and PC Gamer. After moving back home, the project was paused. Public interest reignited development, leading to v2, a more advanced and modular version built in collaboration with electrical engineer Sándor Makra. Akos Blaschek later assisted significantly in documenting the project for open-sourcing, aiming to enable others to replicate and build upon this work. Key metallic components were designed and sourced in collaboration with SZURWIN KFT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic ball setup&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rats trained to run forward&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimal sensors and mechanics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No panoramic screen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New ball driver mechanism for smoother movement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foldable AMOLED screen with 180° horizontal and 80° vertical FOV, Full HD resolution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgraded sensors for movement tracking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforced feeder system with mixing motor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modular 3D-printable components&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improved electronics reliability and safety&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We reached the point of rat habituation but didn’t start training. Our rats (Todd, Kojima, Gabe) aged out before full testing. The setup works, but behavioral validation is pending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware is a comprehensive VR rig designed for rodents. It consists of a motion-tracked sphere that captures the rat's movements, a custom-built trigger for in-game actions, a curved panoramic screen for visual immersion, and an automated reward system that dispenses sugar water to reinforce behavior. All these components are mounted on a modular aluminum frame, creating a complete, self-contained environment for the rat to interact with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headset wraps around the rat’s head with a foldable AMOLED screen. It maximizes immersion without obstructing whisker space. The screen supports Full HD resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headset frame also integrates several sensory components: two small air nozzles are positioned near the left and right whiskers, capable of delivering targeted air puffs on command (e.g., signaling wall collisions in-game). The frame provides a secure mounting point for the reward system's dispenser tube, placing it near the rat's mouth. Additionally, the design includes placeholders for miniature speakers near each ear, intended for future implementation of stereo audio cues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Headset&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locomotion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Movement is captured via a free-spinning ball under the rat. Rotary sensors track displacement and convert it into game motion. The ball can also be driven by motors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These motors are used during training to roll the ball and simulate movement paths before a reward. This guides the rat on where to go, helping form movement-action associations. Like the trigger, this allows for programmatic training sequences with minimal initial input from the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Stand/Ball&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigger Input&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shooting input is a custom-built hand-operated lever. Rats pull it with their paws to fire. The lever is held in place by small springs, encased in a 3D-printed housing. It includes a rotary encoder to detect motion and a stepper motor to actuate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The motor allows programmatic control—pulling the lever to demonstrate shooting. This enables training by pairing visual cues with mechanical motion, reinforcing the association before the rat initiates the action on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Trigger&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward System&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Positive in-game actions trigger a liquid reward: sugar water delivered through a precise dispensing mechanism. The system consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mixer: Continuously stirs the sugar solution to maintain even concentration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pump + Pressure Sensor: Keeps the line under constant pressure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solenoid Valve: Magnetic valve that opens to release exact 10 µL doses&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispenser: Positioned near the mouth for easy access&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This setup ensures accurate, repeatable reward delivery with minimal delay. The reward is synchronized with game events to reinforce desired behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current system assumes basic rat mobility and grooming behavior. Fine-tuning might be needed for rats of different sizes or temperaments. Trigger placement and reward tube flow may need calibration per subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup is controlled through a modular Python system. The main entry point is arena_scenario.py, which runs the full control loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motion capture: Reads movement from optical flow sensors mounted around the treadmill ball.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locomotion control: Drives the ball motors to guide the rat during training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigger input: Reads lever pulls, detects voluntary shooting actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward delivery: Dispenses precise 10 μL sugar water rewards via a controlled solenoid valve and maintains constant line pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DOOM integration: Interfaces with a modified ViZDoom environment for real-time closed-loop behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training logic: Enforces demonstrations and delivers rewards based on game state and rat behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software runs on a PC and communicates with a Raspberry Pi via TCP sockets. The Pi handles real-time sensor reading, ball actuation, and reward control; the PC processes the sensor data, runs the game, and sends high-level commands to the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All major components—movement tracking, ball driving, trigger detection, and reward control—can be operated manually or in closed-loop mode. All control parameters (e.g., motor speeds, reward volumes) are set in Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no in-built calibration suite. Users must validate sensor alignment and reward timing manually. Some microcontroller firmwares might require tuning based on hardware tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rats successfully learned to navigate the virtual environment and trigger the shooting mechanism. Habituation took approximately two weeks per rat. While advanced training wasn't completed due to time constraints, initial data showed promising engagement with the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full behavioral validation requires longer training periods. Cross-subject variability wasn't extensively studied. The impact of prolonged VR exposure on rat well-being needs further research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Now?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GNU Unifont is part of the GNU Project. This page contains the latest release of GNU Unifont, with glyphs for every printable code point in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). The BMP occupies the first 65,536 code points of the Unicode space, denoted as U+0000..U+FFFF. There is also growing coverage of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP), in the range U+010000..U+01FFFF, and of Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) with Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Commercial Use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A user has asked if GNU Unifont can be used with commercial (non-free) software. The answer is yes. The GNU Font Embedding Exception and the SIL OFL allow for that. See the next section for details. The main purpose of the licensing is to require derivative fonts that others create to be released to the public under the same licensing terms, not to prohibit the use of those fonts with certain software. Thus, preserving the license terms in derivative fonts provides a public benefit. The licenses also provide acknowledgement of previous Unifont contributors for their volunteer work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Copyright, Derivative Works, and License&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of Unifont glyphs are creations of individual Unifont contributors; those glyphs enjoy copyright protections of various degrees. Some of those contributions are letter forms of established alphabets while others are icon (symbol) designs such as the many animal icons which, as artistic designs, have even stronger international protections. See for example this memorandum of applicable laws of Berne Union member country Germany (where Unifont was created): Unifont Copyright Protections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Derivative variants of Unifont are permitted under the terms of the dual license: GNU GPLv2+ with the GNU Font Embedding Exception and the SIL Open Font License version 1.1. These are free licenses. The remainder of this section provides details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These font files are licensed under the GNU General Public License, either Version 2 or (at your option) a later version, with the exception that embedding the font in a document does not in itself constitute a violation of the GNU GPL. The full terms of the license are in LICENSE.txt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of Unifont version 13.0.04, the fonts are dual-licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1 and the GNU GPL 2+ with the GNU font embedding exception. The SIL OFL is available at OFL-1.1.txt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Font Downloads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard font build — with and without the ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) / Under-CSUR Private Use Area (PUA) glyphs. Download in your favorite format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; OpenType: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Standard Unifont OpenType Download: unifont-17.0.03.otf (5 Mbytes)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unifont Japanese OpenType Version: unifont_jp-17.0.03.otf (5 Mbytes)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Glyphs above the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane: unifont_upper-17.0.03.otf (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unicode ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) PUA Glyphs: unifont_csur-17.0.03.otf (0.5 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; BDF: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;unifont-17.0.03.bdf.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unifont Japanese BDF Version: unifont_jp-17.0.03.bdf.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specialized versions — built by request:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PSF: A specialized PSF 1 console frame buffer font consisting of 512 glyphs for use with APL, A Programming Language, in console mode (single-user mode on GNU/Linux, etc.), mainly to support GNU APL: Unifont-APL8x16-17.0.03.psf.gz (4 kbytes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HEX: All the Plane 0 glyphs in Roman's .hex format, for those who wish to experiment: unifont-17.0.03.hex.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HEX: The above .hex file with combining circles added: unifont_sample-17.0.03.hex.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Windows or Mac OS X, unzip the .ttf.zip file or download the uncompressed .ttf file and copy the font to your Fonts folder. On Microsoft Windows, this folder is located under the Windows folder on your main disk. On a Mac, this is located under the Library folder on your main disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For best appearance on a Mac in a Terminal window, select Terminal from the menu, then Preferences. A Settings window will appear. Make sure that you're on the Text tab in that window. Then make sure that the "Antialias text" box is checked. The OpenType version of the font should then look fine at point sizes of 12pt and larger. The font won't look very legible in a Mac Terminal window unless you select this antialias option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: BDF, PCF, and OpenType files contain dimension and spacing information for each glyph in a font. Some font rendering engines ignore this glyph information that the font file provides. This is especially true of rendering engines designed to handle monospace fonts. Unifont will not display all glyphs correctly with such software. The BDF font follows BDF version 2.1 (not version 2.2) because the the X Window System standardized on version 2.1. The PSF 1 version of Unifont is a monospace font but is limited to 512 glyphs, and is only of use with font rendering engines that support more than 256 glyphs in a console frame buffer font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All unifont.hex sources are in the full Unifont Utilities download page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unifont Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifont only stores one glyph per printable Unicode code point. This means that complex scripts with special forms for letter combinations including consonant combinations and floating vowel marks such as with Indic scripts (Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, etc.) or letters that change shape depending upon their position in a word (Indic and Arabic scripts) will not render well in Unifont. In those cases, Unifont is only suitable as a font of last resort. Users wishing to properly render such complex scripts should use full OpenType fonts that faithfully display such alternate forms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drawing New Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute glyphs, please email unifoundry at gmail in advance (not spelled out because of spammers). Several contributors are working on new glyphs, and it would be unfortunate to have multiple persons drawing the same glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Special Note: New Plane 2 and Plane 3 CJK Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The People's Republic of China (PRC) has a set of 15-by-16 pixel Chinese glyphs for Unicode Plane 2 and Plane 3. However, those glyphs are copyrighted and licensed for sale by the Government of the PRC, and thus they cannot be used in a free font. If you happen to have any of those copyrighted 15-by-16 pixel glyphs, please do not send them for inclusion. Unifont includes many glyphs in this range, drawn by Chinese and Japanese volunteers. More are planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Release Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This latest release is part of the GNU Project. You can view the GNU Project Unifont Page on Savannah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the Unicode Plane 0 range is 65,536 code points minus the 2,048 surrogate pair code points, minus the 6,400 Private Use Area code points, minus the two noncharacters (U+FFFE and U+FFFF). This amounts to 57,086 assignable code points apart from the Private Use Area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the higher Unicode planes is 65,534; the last two code points in each plane are reserved as noncharacters.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; 12 September 2023 (Unifont 15.1.01) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;As mentioned during the year leading up to this release, TrueType fonts are no longer produced by the default build; OpenType fonts have taken their place. This change has been driven by the diminishing support for TrueType fonts in the Pango font rendering engine. TrueType fonts can still be built from the distribution tarball using the command "make truetype" in the font directory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ho-Seok Ee proposed a new Johab encoding for algorithmic Hangul Syllables generation. The resulting scheme uses 6 variations of initial consonants (choseong), 3 of medial vowels and diphthongs (jungseong), and 1 of final consonants (jongseong). The image on the left is partial output from a new supporting Unifont utility,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;unijohab2html&lt;/code&gt;, which gives an overview of how the three components of a Hangul syllable combine with each other and outputs any overlaps for a font designer's analysis. A full discussion of this new Johab 6/3/1 encoding appears on the Unifont Hangul Syllables Generation web page. Minseo Lee (ì´ë¯¼ì) provided feedback on the glyphs prior to their release.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Following a suggestion by Ho-Seok Ee, the &lt;code&gt;hangul-base.hex&lt;/code&gt;file that contains the Johab 6/3/1 glyphs for Hangul syllable formation now begins at code point U+E000. This allows building a Unifont variant with that entire Hangul johab glyph set in the Uniode Plane 0 Private Use Area (PUA) using the command "&lt;code&gt;make PUA=plane00/hangul/hangul-base.hex&lt;/code&gt;". in the font directory. Unifont builds have traditionally left the PUA available for CSUR/UCSUR glyphs, which is still the default; see below for a discussion of the CSUR/UCSUR glyphs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Johnnie Weaver modified "IJ" ligature glyphs U+0132 and U+0133. He also modified U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Paul Hardy: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified U+2CC2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER CROSSED SHEI and U+2CC3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER CROSSED SHEI for consistency with the redrawn U+03E2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER SHEI and U+03E3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER SHEI.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Redrew Ideographic Description Characters (U+2FF0..U+2FFB) for consistency and added new glyphs (U+2FFC..U+2FFF). Also added CJK Strokes glyph U+31EF IDEOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION CHARACTER SUBTRACTION.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified star glyphs U+2605, U+2606, and U+2BE8 for consistency.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified several Chinese ideographs and Korean ideographs in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A (U+3400..U+4DBF) per the Unicode Standard version 15.1.0.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Wen Quan Yi Glyphs: Made modifications to Korean ideographs in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A (U+3400..U+4DBF) per Unicode 15.1.0 changes. Modified CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A U+3B9D, U+454E, U+49C8 (from æ¹ è¿æ) and U+56B8. Modified CJK Unified Ideographs Extension U+809E and U+891D.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified Alchemical Symbols (U+1F700..U+1F77F) per Unicode 15.1.0 changes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Added three hexadecimal digit notations to the Plane 0 UCSUR: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+EBE0..U+EBEF: Boby Lapointe's "bibi-binary" notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+EBF0..U+EBFF: Bruce Alan Martin's bit location notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+ECF0..U+ECFF: Ronald O. Whitaker's triangular notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Implemented other glyph changes per the Unicode Standard version 15.1.0.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Several other minor changes; see the ChangeLog file in the main tarball for details.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;1PCF fonts can only include glyphs in Plane 0.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2Only a subset of Plane 2 and Plane 3 CJK glyphs plus the Plane 1 Copyleft glyph (U+1F12F) are included, to stay within the OpenType limit of 65,536 glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The table below links to the Japanese glyphs in Plane 2 (Supplementary Ideographic Plane) contained in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
      Note: These Plane 2 glyphs along with the Plane 0 glyphs in 
      &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt; font files provide complete coverage of the JIS X 0213
      standard.  Only 303 glyphs appear in the files below.  Files with no glyphs appear
      with a gray background.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This next table links to the Chinese glyphs in Plane 2 (Supplementary Ideographic Plane) contained in &lt;code&gt;unifont&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
      Note: These Plane 2 glyphs along with the default Plane 0 glyphs
      in Unifont provide complete coverage of the Table of General Standard Chinese
      Characters (éç¨è§èæ±åè¡¨).  Only 232 glyphs appear in the files below.
      Files with no glyphs appear with a gray background.

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 3 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plane 3 begins with the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G block, from U+30000 through U+3134A. This includes the highly complex biang Chinese ideograph and taito Japanese ideograph:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 14 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This table links to the two ranges of 256 assigned code points in Plane 14 (Tags and Variation Selector Supplement) that appear in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_upper&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 0 and Plane 15 Private Use Area Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Finally, this last glyph table shows ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) and Under CSUR glyphs that appear in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_csur&lt;/code&gt; OpenType
      and TrueType font files.  Not all of the Plane 0 CSUR and UCSUR scripts
      have been drawn, but given the esoteric nature of some CSUR and UCSUR scripts
      (including the unavailability of glyph samples for many of the more obscure
      constructed scripts), the boxes in the table all have a green background color
      even if not at 100% coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Contributing Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute glyphs to the GNU Unifont effort, you can download the associated PNG file from the tables above (SMP and CSUR need additions). Then draw new glyphs in the 16-by-16 pixel area that is inside the inner box you see in the image on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When done, erase the surrounding inner box and ruler lines around the inner box. You can then save the file as a monochrome bitmap image. Then convert the .png file into a .hex file with the unipng2hex utility in the source tarball. Or you can just email the .png file to me as a contribution to this effort and I will do the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Why is the outer grid so much larger than the 16-by-16 pixel inner box?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A: Because in a future version, unipng2hex, unihex2png, and other utilities should be able to handle larger glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table below shows the current state of completion of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (Plane 1). Any range in the table that doesn't have a green background has missing glyphs. To see which scripts are in a particular range, consult the "Supplementary Multilingual Plane" list in the Current Coverage section below. The more red a range appears in the table below, the more glyphs are missing from that range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Current Coverage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Links in this section reference the first block of 256 glyphs where a script begins.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Note: Scripts such as Cuneiform, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, and Bamum Supplement will not be drawn on a 16-by-16 pixel grid. There are plans to draw these scripts on a 32-by-32 pixel grid in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plane 14 has two scripts, both of which Unifont covers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt; GNU Unifont Glyphs &lt;p&gt;Plane 14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Range&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Script&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;U+0E0000..U+0E007F&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tags&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;U+0E0100..U+0E01EF&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Variations Selectors Supplement&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list below shows the scripts that are in Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) and Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR that have coverage in this release of Unifont:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially I just posted my additions to Roman Czyborra's original unifont.hex file. Then in mid-January 2008, his website went down. So I started posting font updates here. Roman has encouraged me to continue with my additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roman's website is now back online, and you can read his Unifont description and motivation for its creation on his website, along with his archive of Unifont's changes: http://czyborra.com/unifont.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TrueType Font Generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis Alejandro González Miranda wrote a cool combination of scripts to convert GNU Unifont from .hex format into FontForge .sfd format, then to have FontForge convert this to a TrueType outline font (see the Unicode Utilities web page on this site for more information). Pixels are drawn as outlined squares, so they scale to all point sizes. This works well with GNOME; I haven't tried it with any other Unix windowing environment. I've removed the OpenType SBIT font link from this page because the outline font is much more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis has given me permission to modify his scripts to convert the latest GNU Unifont versions to TrueType. I've modified his original scripts to handle Unicode combining characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JIS X 0213 Kanji&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Jiskan16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Unifont 12.1.02 added Japanese BDF and TrueType versions, &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt;.  This replaced over 10,000 ideographs
    in the default Unifont font with Japanese kanji from the 16 × 16
    pixel Jiskan 16 font.  The font is available in two files,
    corresponding to the two planes in JIS X 0213.  Both files are
    in the public domain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comments in the BDF source font files (downloadable from the Japanese Fonts page) credit the following contributors (in order): Toshiyuki Imamura, HANATAKA Shinya, Taichi Kawabata, Koichi Yasuoka, TOYOSHIMA Masayuki, Kazuo Koike, and SATO Yasunao.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Unifont release, the glyphs from the two JIS X 0213 planes were converted into Unifont .hex files and mapped to code points in Unicode's Plane 0 and Plane 2 for Unifont. The result provides complete representation of the kanji in JIS X 0213 in a free Unicode font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Izumi16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifont 12.1.03 replaced the Jiskan16 glyphs with the public domain Izumi16 glyphs. These provide improvements on the earlier Jiskan16 glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wen Quan Yi: Spring of Letters (文泉驛 / 文泉驿)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Unifont CJK glyphs were replaced by new CJK glyphs from version 1.1 of Qianqian Fang's Unibit font. The Unibit font began as a combination of the original GNU Unifont glyphs and a basic CJK bitmap font placed in the public domain by the People's Republic of China. It adopted GNU Unifont's scheme of 8x16 and 16x16 glyphs. Qianqian Fang and many others then added about 10,000 more glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qianqian states in the Unibit distribution: "The entire CJK Unified Ideographics (U4E00-U9FA5) and CJK Unified Ideographics Extension A(U3400-U4DB5) blocks were replaced by high-quality glyphs from China National Standard GB19966-2005 (public domain)." Wen Quan Yi volunteeers then edited thousands of these characters. Qianqian also drew the new 22 CJK ideographs in the range U+9FA6..U+9FBB that appear in GNU Unifont.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wen Quan Yi (WQY) means "spring of letters," as in a spring of water. This is an interesting choice of words, as the British spelling of "font" is "fount" (but still pronounced "font"). See his website for more details: http://wqy.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/enindex.cgi, or in Chinese at http://wenq.org/wqy2/index.cgi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following code points in the latest unifont.hex file are taken from the WQY Unibit font (with my additions to complete the U+3000..U+33FF range, particularly the missing Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji), including glyphs updated by the Wen Quan Yi volunteers and other modifications as part of the Unifont font:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2E80..U+2EFF: CJK Radicals Supplement&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2F00..U+2FDF: Kangxi Radicals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2FF0..U+2FFF: Ideographic Description Characters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3000..U+303F: CJK Symbols and Punctuation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+31C0..U+31EF: CJK Strokes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3200..U+32FF: Enclosed CJK Letters and Months&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3300..U+33FF: CJK Compatibility&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3400..U+4DBF: CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+4E00..U+9FBF: CJK Unified Ideographs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+F900..U+FAFF: CJK Compatibility Ideographs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+FF00..U+FF60: Fullwidth Forms of Roman Letters&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qianqian has given his okay to add these CJK glyphs from the Wen Quan Yi project into GNU Unifont. Likewise, I've told him to incorporate any glyphs he wants from my contributions to GNU Unifont into his Unibit font. In October 2020, Qianqian Fang also granted permission to apply the SIL Open Font License version 1.1 to Wen Quan Yi glyphs in Unifont as a dual license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What's Next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the glyphs in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane that could easily be drawn in a 16-by-16 pixel grid have been drawn as of the Unifont 9.0.01 release. There are no plans to draw Tangut. A number of ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) scripts remain to be drawn. If you are interested in contributing glyphs to this effort, please contact me. All new contributions must be licensed under the same license as the rest of Unifont (in a nutshell, GPL 2+ with the GNU font embedding exception and the SIL OFL 1.1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the great work done by contributors in providing ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) glyphs, they are available in font files that have "_csur" in their name.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 is a minimalist, dependency-free virtual machine sandbox designed for microcontrollers and other resource-constrained devices. Single C file, no dynamic memory allocations, asynchronous design, pure C99.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On an STM32L0 (ARM Cortex-M0+) the required footprint is under 4KB flash/1KB RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 is a RISC-V emulator, wrapped in a management interface and provided with tools to build efficient code to run in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a no-frills alternative to embedded script engines (Lua, Duktape, MicroPython, etc)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a sandbox to isolate untrusted or unreliable elements of a system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a way to allow development in modern systems programming languages where a compiler for the target may not be available (rust-hello)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a way to write once, run anywhere and avoid maintaining multiple software variants&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bytecode example apps written in C, Zig, Rust and assembly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-blocking design, preventing misbehaving bytecode from stalling the host&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No assumptions about host IO capabilities (no stdio)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple, opinionated execution model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Safe minimally typed FFI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small enough for "if this then that" scripts/plugins, capable enough for much more&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aims for safety over speed, bad code running in the VM should never be able to crash the host&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although based on a fully fledged CPU emulator, uvm32 is intended for executing custom script like logic, not for simulating hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many scripting languages and virtual machines are available for embedding in small systems and they all make tradeoffs in different dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 aims for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small footprint (suitable for embedded devices, games and apps)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support well-known programming languages for VM code (with high quality dev tools)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ease of integration into existing software&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexibility of paradigm (event driven, polling, multi-processor)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Robustness against misbehaving VM code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 does not aim for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frictionless FFI (no direct function calls between host and VM code)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum possible efficiency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The simplest scripting experience for VM code (a develop-compile-run cycle is expected)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Batteries included" libraries to do stdio, networking, etc&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 is a tiny virtual machine, all of the code is in uvm32.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A minimal example of a host to run code in is at host-mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything else is a more advanced host example, or a sample application which could be run in a host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple VM host from host-mini&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OpenAI are quietly adopting skills, now available in ChatGPT and Codex CLI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;12th December 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the things that most excited me about Anthropic’s new Skills mechanism back in October is how easy it looked for other platforms to implement. A skill is just a folder with a Markdown file and some optional extra resources and scripts, so any LLM tool with the ability to navigate and read from a filesystem should be capable of using them. It turns out OpenAI are doing exactly that, with skills support quietly showing up in both their Codex CLI tool and now also in ChatGPT itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Skills in ChatGPT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learned about this from Elias Judin this morning. It turns out the Code Interpreter feature of ChatGPT now has a new &lt;code&gt;/home/oai/skills&lt;/code&gt; folder which you can access simply by prompting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Create a zip file of /home/oai/skills&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried that myself and got back this zip file. Here’s a UI for exploring its content (more about that tool).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far they cover spreadsheets, docx and PDFs. Interestingly their chosen approach for PDFs and documents is to convert them to rendered per-page PNGs and then pass those through their vision-enabled GPT models, presumably to maintain information from layout and graphics that would be lost if they just ran text extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elias shared copies in a GitHub repo. They look very similar to Anthropic’s implementation of the same kind of idea, currently published in their anthropics/skills repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried it out by prompting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Create a PDF with a summary of the rimu tree situation right now and what it means for kakapo breeding season&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure enough, GPT-5.2 Thinking started with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reading skill.md for PDF creation guidelines&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Searching rimu mast and Kākāpō 2025 breeding status&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took just over eleven minutes to produce this PDF, which was long enough that I had Claude Code for web build me a custom PDF viewing tool while I waited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s ChatGPT’s PDF in that tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I am very excited about Kākāpō breeding season this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason it took so long is that it was fastidious about looking at and tweaking its own work. I appreciated that at one point it tried rendering the PDF and noticed that the macrons in kākāpō were not supported by the chosen font, so it switched to something else:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Skills in Codex CLI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, two weeks ago OpenAI’s open source Codex CLI tool landed a PR titled feat: experimental support for skills.md. The most recent docs for that are in docs/skills.md.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The documentation suggests that any folder in &lt;code&gt;~/.codex/skills&lt;/code&gt; will be treated as a skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dug around and found the code that generates the prompt that drives the skill system in codex-rs/core/src/skills/render.rs—here’s a Gist with a more readable version of that prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used Claude Opus 4.5’s skill authoring skill to create this skill for creating Datasette plugins, then installed it into my Codex CLI skills folder like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/datasette/skill \
  ~/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to run Codex with the &lt;code&gt;--enable skills&lt;/code&gt; option. I ran this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd /tmp
mkdir datasette-cowsay
cd datasette-cowsay
codex --enable skills -m gpt-5.2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then prompted:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;list skills&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Codex replied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;- datasette-plugins — Writing Datasette plugins using Python + pluggy (file: /Users/simon/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin/SKILL.md)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;- Discovery — How to find/identify available skills (no SKILL.md path provided in the list)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Write a Datasette plugin in this folder adding a /-/cowsay?text=hello page that displays a pre with cowsay from PyPI saying that text&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It worked perfectly! Here’s the plugin code it wrote and here’s a copy of the full Codex CLI transcript, generated with my terminal-to-html tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try that out yourself if you have &lt;code&gt;uvx&lt;/code&gt; installed like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uvx --with https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cowsay/archive/refs/heads/main.zip \
  datasette&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then visit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/cowsay?text=This+is+pretty+fun
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Skills are a keeper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first wrote about skills in October I said Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP. The fact that it’s just turned December and OpenAI have already leaned into them in a big way reinforces to me that I called that one correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are based on a very light specification, if you could even call it that, but I still think it would be good for these to be formally documented somewhere. This could be a good initiative for the new Agentic AI Foundation (previously) to take on.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Lisp Interpreter Implemented in Conway's Game of Life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisp in Life is a Lisp interpreter implemented in Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entire pattern is viewable on the browser here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a high-level programming language was interpreted in Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Running Lisp on the Game of Life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisp is a language with a simple and elegant design, having an extensive ability to express sophisticated ideas as simple programs. Notably, the powerful feature of macros could be used to modify the language’s syntax to write programs in a highly flexible way. For example, macros can be used to introduce new programming paradigms to the language, as demonstrated in object-oriented-like.lisp (which can actually be evaluated by the interpreter, although complex programs take quite a long time to finish running), where a structure and syntax similar to classes in Object Oriented Programming is constructed. Despite the expressibility of Lisp, it is the world’s second oldest high-level programming language introduced in 1958, only to be preceded by Fortran.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automaton proposed in 1970. Despite it having a very simple set of rules, it is known to be Turing Complete. Lisp in Life demonstrates this fact in a rather straightforward way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can simple systems allow human thoughts to be articulated and be expanded? With the expressibility of Lisp and the basis of Conway’s Game of Life, Lisp in Life provides an answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Input and Output&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lisp program is provided by editing certain cells within the pattern to represent the ASCII-encoding of the Lisp program. The pattern directly reads this text and evaluates the results. You can also load your own Lisp program into the pattern and run it. The standard output is written at the bottom end of the RAM module, which can be easily located and directly examined in a Game of Life viewer. The Lisp implementation supports lexical closures and macros, allowing one to write Lisp programs in a Lisp-like taste, as far as the memory limit allows you to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lisp interpreter is written in C. Using the build system for this project, you can also compile your own C11-compatible C code and run in on Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Previous Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a high-level programming language was interpreted in Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entry featuring Universal Computers in LifeWiki has a list of computers created in the Game of Life. Two important instances not mentioned in this entry are the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project created by the authors of the QFT project, and APGsembly created by Adam P. Goucher. All of these work are designed to run an assembly language and are not designed to interpret a high-level language per se.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An example of a compiled high-level language targeted for the Game of Life is Cogol by the QFT project. Cogol is compiled to the assembly language QFTASM, targeted for the QFT architecture. Although Cogol is targeted for the QFT architecture, it requires compilation to QFTASM for the code to be run in the QFT architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Lisp in Life, a modified version of the QFT architecture is first created for improving the pattern’s runtime. Modifications include introducing a new cascaded storage architecture for the ROM, new opcodes, extending the ROM and RAM address space, etc. The Lisp source code is then written into the computer’s RAM module as its raw binary ASCII format. The Conway’s Game of Life pattern directly reads, parses, and evaluates this Lisp source code to produce its output. This feature of allowing a Conway’s Game of Life pattern to evaluate a high-level programming language expressed as a string of text is a novel feature that was newly achieved in this project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Video&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a YouTube video showing Lisp in Life in action:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Screenshots&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An overview of the entire architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An overview of the CPU and its surrounding modules. On the top are the ROM modules, with the lookup module on the right, and the value modules on the left. On the bottom left is the CPU. On the bottom right is the RAM module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern is the VarLife version of the architecture. VarLife is an 8-state cellular automaton defined in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project, which is used as an intermediate layer to create the final Conway’s Game of Life pattern. The colors of the cells indicate the 8 distinct states of the VarLife rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The architecture is based on Tetris8.mc in the original QFT repository. Various modifications were made to make the pattern compact, such as introducing a new lookup table architecture for the ROM, removing and adding new opcodes, expanding the ROM and RAM address space, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Conway’s Game of Life version of the architecture, converted from the VarLife pattern. What appears to be a single cell in this image is actually an OTCA metapixel zoomed away to be shown 2048 times smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A close-up view of a part of the ROM module in the Conway’s Game of Life version. Each pixel in the previous image is actually this square-shaped structure shown in this image. These structures are OTCA metapixels, which can be seen to be in the On and Off meta-states in this image. The OTCA Metapixel is a special Conway’s Game of Life pattern that can emulate cellular automatons with customized rules. The original VarLife pattern is simulated this way so that it can run in Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OTCA Metapixel simulating Life in Life can be seen in this wonderful video by Phillip Bradbury: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A video of the RAM module in the VarLife rule in action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The computer showing the results of the following Lisp program:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(define mult (lambda (m n)
  (* m n)))

(print (mult 3 14))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;, shown in binary ascii format (&lt;code&gt;0b110100&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0b110010&lt;/code&gt;), read in bottom-to-up order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As shown in this image, the standard output of the Lisp program gets written at the bottom end of the RAM module, and can be directly viewed in a Game of Life viewer. This repository also contains scripts that run on Golly to decode and view the contents of the output as strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How is it Done?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lisp interpreter, written in C, is compiled to an assembly language for a CPU architecture implemented in the Game of Life, which is a modification of the computer used in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) project. The compilation is done using an extended version of ELVM (the Esoteric Language Virtual Machine). The Game of Life backend for ELVM was implemented by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generating a small enough pattern that runs in a reasonable amount of time required a lot of effort. This required optimizations and improvements in every layer of the project; a brief summary would be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The C Compiler layer - adding the computed goto feature to the C compiler, preserving variable symbols to be used after compilation, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The C layer (the Lisp interpreter) - using a string hashtable and binary search for Lisp symbol lookup, minimization of stack region usage with union memory structures, careful memory region map design, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The QFTASM layer - writing a compiler optimizer to optimize the length of the assembly code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The VarLife layer (the CPU architecture) - creating a lookup table architecture for faster ROM access, expanding the size and length of the RAM module, adding new opcodes, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Game of Life layer - Hashlife-specific optimization&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more detailed description of the optimizations done in this project is available in the Implementation Details section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conversion from VarLife to Conway’s Game of Life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VarLife is an 8-state cellular automaton defined in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project. It is used as an intermediate layer to generate the final Conway’s Game of Life pattern; the computer is first created in VarLife, and then converted to a Game of Life pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When converting VarLife to Conway’s Game of Life, each VarLife cell is mapped to an OTCA Metapixel (OTCAMP). The conversion from VarLife to the Game of Life is done in a way so that the behavior of the states of the VarLife pattern matches exactly with the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels in the converted Game of Life pattern. Therefore, it is enough to verify the behavior of the VarLife pattern to verify the behavior of the Game of Life pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the use of OTCA Metapixels, each VarLife cell becomes extended to a 2048x2048 Game of Life cell, and 1 VarLife generation requires 35328 Game of Life generations. Therefore, the VarLife patterns run significantly faster than the Game of Life (GoL) version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional details on VarLife are available in the Miscellaneous section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pattern Files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pattern files preloaded with various Lisp programs are available here. Detailed statistics such as the running time and the memory consumption are available in the Running Times and Statistics section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The patterns can be simulated on the Game of Life simulator Golly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VarLife patterns can be simulated on Golly as well. To run the VarLife patterns, open Golly and see File -&amp;gt; Preferences -&amp;gt; Control, and Check the “Your Rules” directory. Open the directory, and copy https://github.com/woodrush/QFT-devkit/blob/main/QFT-devkit/Varlife.rule to the directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Descriptions of the Lisp Programs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;object-oriented-like.lisp: This example creates a structure similar to classes in Object-Oriented Programming, using closures.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The class has methods and field variables, where each instance carries distinct and persistent memory locations of their own. The example instantiates two counters and concurrently modifies the value held by each instance.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;New syntaxes for instantiation and method access, &lt;code&gt;(new classname)&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;(. instance methodname)&lt;/code&gt;, are introduced using macros and functions.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Lisp interpreter’s variable scope and the macro feature is powerful enough to manage complex memory management, and even providing a new syntax to support the target paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;printquote.lisp: A simple demonstration of macros.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;factorial.lisp: A simple demonstration of recursion with the factorial function.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;z-combinator.lisp: Demonstration of the Z Combinator to implement a factorial function using anonymous recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;backquote-splice.lisp: Implements the backquote macro used commonly in Lisp to construct macros. It also supports the unquote and unquote-splice operations, each written as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;~@&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;primes.lisp: Prints a list of prime numbers up to 20. This example highlights the use of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;syntax.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contents of print.lisp is quite straightforward - it calculates and prints the result of &lt;code&gt;3 * 14&lt;/code&gt;.
backquote.lisp and primes-print.lisp are similar to backquote-splice.lisp and primes.lisp, mainly included for performance comparisons.
backquote.lisp doesn’t implement the unquote-splice operation, and demonstrates some more examples.
primes-print.lisp reduces the number of list operations to save memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Details of the Lisp Interpreter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Special Forms and Builtin Functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;define&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;quote&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;car, cdr&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;cons&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;list&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;atom&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;progn&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;while&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lambda, macro&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;eval&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;eq&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;+, -, *, /, mod, &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lexical Closures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Lisp interpreter supports lexical closures. The implementation of lexical closures is powerful enough to write an object-oriented-like code as shown in object-oriented-like.lisp, where classes are represented as lexical closures over the field variables and the class methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Macros&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Lisp interpreter supports macros. Lisp macros can be thought as a function that receives code and returns code. Following this design, macros are treated exacly the same as lambdas, except that it takes the arguments as raw S-expressions, and evaluates the result twice (the first time to build the expression, and the second time to actually evaluate the builded expression).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The running times for each program are shown above. The Hashlife algorithm used for the simulation requires a lot of memory in exchange of speedups. The simulations were run on a 32GB-RAM computer, with Golly’s memory usage limit set to 28000 MB, and the default base step to 2 (configurable from the preferences). The memory usage was measured by Ubuntu’s activity monitor. “(max.)” shows where the maximum permitted memory was used. The number of CPU cycles and the QFT memory usage was obtained by running the QFTASM interpreter on the host PC. The QFT memory usage shows the number of RAM addresses that were written at least once. The memory usage is measured in words, which is 16 bits in this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the VarLife patterns can actually be run on a computer. The shortest running time is about 1 minute for print.lisp. A sophisticated program such as object-oriented-like.lisp can even run in about 22 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Game of Life patterns take significantly more time than the VarLife patterns, but for short programs it can be run in a moderately reasonable amount of time. For example, print.lisp finishes running in about 6 hours in the Game of Life pattern. As mentioned in the “Conversion from VarLife to Conway’s Game of Life” section, since the Game of Life pattern emulates the behavior of the VarLife pattern using OTCA Metapixels, the behavior of the Game of Life patterns can be verified by running the VarLife patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are tests to check the behavior of the Lisp interpreter. There is a test for checking the QFTASM-compiled Lisp interpreter using the QFTASM interpreter, and a test for checking the GCC-compiled Lisp interpreter on the host pc. To run these tests, use the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git submodule update --init --recursive # Required for building the source

make test             # Run the tests for the QFTASM-compiled Lisp interpreter, using the QFTASM interpreter
make test_executable  # Run the tests for the executable compiled by GCC
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;make test&lt;/code&gt; requires Hy, a Clojure-like Lisp implemented in Python available via &lt;code&gt;pip install hy&lt;/code&gt;.
Some of the tests compare the output results of Hy and the output of the QFTASM Lisp interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tests were run on Ubuntu and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building from Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section explains how to load the Lisp interpreter (written in C) to the Game of Life pattern, and also how to load a custom Lisp program into the pattern to run it on Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section describes the implementation details for the various optimizations for the QFT assembly and the resulting Game of Life pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The C Compiler layer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added the computed goto feature to ELVM &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This was merged into the original ELVM project.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modified the compiler to preserve and output memory address symbols and program address symbols, for their usage in the compiler optimization tool in the QFTASM layer &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This allows to use memheader.eir, so that symbols used in the C source can be referenced in the ELVM assembly layer using the same variable symbols.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The ELVM Assembly layer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wrote the QFTASM backend for ELVM &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This was merged into the original ELVM project.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added further improvements to the QFTASM backend: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Let the ELVM assembly’s memory address space match QFT’s native memory address space &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Originally, the ELVM assembly had to convert its memory address every time when a memory access occurs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support new opcodes added in the improved QFT architecture&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Let the ELVM assembly’s memory address space match QFT’s native memory address space &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The C layer (the implementation of the Lisp interpreter)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Usage of binary search and hashtables for string representations and comparisons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By profiling the GCC-compiled version of the Lisp interpreter, it was found that the string table lookup process was a large performance bottleneck. This was a large room for optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The optimized string lookup process is as follows. First, when the Lisp parser accepts a symbol token, it creates a 4-bit hash of the string with the checksum of the ASCII representation of the string. The hash points to a hashtable that holds the root of a binary search tree for string comparison. Each node in the tree holds the string of the symbol token, and two nodes that are before and after the token in alphabetical order. When a query symbol token arrives in the parsing phase, a node with a matching token is returned, or a new node for the token is added into this binary tree if the token does not exist yet. This allows for each distinct symbol in the S-expression to have a distinct memory address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the interpretation phase, since each distinct symbol has a distinct memory address, and every string required for the Lisp program has already been parsed, string comparison can be done by simply comparing the memory address of the tokens. Since the interpreter only uses string equality operations for string comparison, simply checking for integer equality suffices for string comparison, speeding up the interpretation phase. Since the hash key is 4 bits long, this allows for reducing 4 searches in the binary tree compared to using a single binary tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Usage of jump hash tables for the special form evaluation procedure searches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 17 distinct procedures for evaluating the special forms in the Lisp interpreter, &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;quote&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cdr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cons&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;atom&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;progn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, {&lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;macro&lt;/code&gt;}, &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt;, {&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mod&lt;/code&gt;}, {&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;}, &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;, and lambda/macro invocations (when if the token is not a special form). Using an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement to find the corresponding procedure for a given token becomes a linear search for the token comparisons. To speed up this search process, a hash table is created for jumping to the corresponding procedures. Since the memory addresses for the special forms can be determined before parsing the Lisp program, all of the symbols for the special forms have a fixed memory address. Therefore, the hash key can be created by subtracting an offset to the symbol’s memory address, to point to a hashtable that is created near the register locations. This hashtable is provided in memheader.eir. When the hash key is larger than the regions of this hashtable, it means that the symbol is not a special form, so the evaluation jumps to the lambda/macro invocation procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Usage of 2-bit headers to represent value types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lisp implementation has 3 distinct value types, &lt;code&gt;ATOM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INT&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;LAMBDA&lt;/code&gt;. Each value only consumes one QFT byte of memory; the &lt;code&gt;ATOM&lt;/code&gt; value holds the pointer to the symbol’s string hashtable, the &lt;code&gt;INT&lt;/code&gt; value holds the signed integer value, and &lt;code&gt;LAMBDA&lt;/code&gt; holds a pointer to the &lt;code&gt;Lambda&lt;/code&gt; struct, as well as its subtype information, of either &lt;code&gt;LAMBDA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MACRO&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TEMPLAMBDA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TEMPMACRO&lt;/code&gt;. (The &lt;code&gt;TEMPLAMBDA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TEMPMACRO&lt;/code&gt; subtypes are lambda and macro types that recycles its argument value memory space every time it is called, but is unused in the final lisp programs.) Since the RAM’s address space is only 10 bits, there are 6 free bits that can be used for addresses holding pointers. Therefore, the value type and subtype information is held in these free bits. This makes the integer in the Lisp implementation to be a 14-bit signed integer, ranging from -8192 to 8191.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Minimization of Stack Region Usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the C compiler used in this project does not have memory optimization features, this has to be done manually within the C source code. This led to the largest reason why the interpreter’s source code seems to be obfuscated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the largest bottlenecks for memory access was stack region usage. Every time a stack region memory access occurs, the assembly code performs memory address offset operations to access the stack region. This does not happen when accessing the heap memory, since there is only one heap region used in the entire program, so the pointers for global variables can be hard-coded by the assembler. Therefore, it is favorable optimization-wise to use the heap memory as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to make use of this fact is to use as much global variables as possible. Since registers and common RAM memory share the same memory space, global variables can be accessed with a speed comparable to registers (However, since the physical location of the RAM memory slot within the pattern affects the I/O signal arrival time, and the registers have the most smallest RAM addresses, i.e. they are the closest to the CPU unit, the registers have the fastest memory access time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another method of saving memory was to use union memory structures to minimize the stack region usage. In the C compiler used in this project, every time a new variable is introduced in a function, the function’s stack region usage (used per call) is increased to fit all of the variables. This happens even when two variables never appear at the same time. Therefore, using the fact that some variables never appear simultaneously, unions are used for every occurence of such variables, so that they can use a shared region within the stack space. This led to minimization of the stack region usage. Since the stack region is only 233 hextets (1 byte in the QFT RAM is 16 bits) large, this allowed to increase the number of nested function calls, especially the nested calls of &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; which evaluates the S-expressions. Since the S-expressions have a list structure, and &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; becomes nested when lambdas are called in the Lisp program, this optimization was significant for allowing more sophisticated Lisp programs to be run in the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The QFTASM layer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The QFT assembly generated by the C compiler has a lot of room for optimization. I therefore created a compiler optimization tool to reduce the QFTASM assembly size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Constant folding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediate constant expressions such as &lt;code&gt;ADD 1 2 destination&lt;/code&gt; is folded to a &lt;code&gt;MOV&lt;/code&gt; operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;&lt;code&gt;MOV&lt;/code&gt; folding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The QFT assembly code can be splitted into subregions by jump operations, such that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each subregion doesn’t contain any jump operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each subregion ends with a jump operation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every jump operation in the assembly is guaranteed to jump to the beginning of a subregion, and never to the middle of any subregion&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last guarantee where jumps never occur in the middle of a subregion is provided by the C compiler. The ELVM assembly’s program counter is designed so that it increases only when a jump instruction appears. This makes an ELVM program counter to point to a sequence of multiple instructions, instead of a single instruction. Since the ELVM assembly uses the ELVM program counter for its jump instructions, it is guaranteed that the jump instructions in the QFT assembly never jump to the middle of any subregion, and always jumps to a beginning of a subregion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In each subregion, the dependency graph for the memory address is created. If a memory address becomes written but is later overwritten without becoming used in that subregion at all, the instruction to write to that memory address is removed. Since it is guaranteed that jump operations never jump to the middle of any subregion, it is guaranteed that the overwritten values can be safely removed without affecting the outcome of the program. The &lt;code&gt;MOV&lt;/code&gt; folding optimization makes use of this fact to remove unnecessary instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This folding process is also done with dereferences; if a dereferenced memory address is written, and the address is overwritten without being used at all, and the dereference source is unoverwritten at all during this process, the instruction for writingto the dereferenced memory address is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Jump folding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the destination of a conditional or fixed-destination jump instruction points to another jump instruction with a fixed destination, the jump destination is folded to the latter jump instruction’s destination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar folding is done when a fixed jump instruction points to a conditional jump instruction, where the fixed jump instruction is replaced by the latter conditional jump instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Varlife layer (the computer architecture)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Created the with a lookup table structure for the ROM module&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this image of the CPU and its surrounding modules, the two modules on the top are the ROM modules. The original ROM module had one table, with the memory address as the key and the instruction as the value. I recreated the ROM module to add a lookup table layer, where each distinct instruction (not the opcodes, but the entire instruction including the values used within) holds a distinct serial integer key. The ROM module on the right accepts a program counter address and returns the instruction key for the program counter. The module on the left accepts the instruction key and returns the actual bits of the instruction as the output. This allows for dictionary compression to be performed to the ROM data, saving a lot of space. Since the instructions are 45 bits and the instruction keys are only 10 bits, the instruction key table is 1/4 the size of the original ROM module. Although the ROM size is 3223 for the entire Lisp interpreter, there were only 616 distinct instructions in the Lisp interpreter, making the size of the instruction table be 616 ROM units high, effectively reducing the ROM module size altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ROM module features another form of compression, where absence of cells are used to represent 0-valued bits within the instruction. Below is a close-up look of the ROM value module:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that some cells on the left are absent, despite the table being expected to be a rectangular shape. This is because absent cells do not emit any signals, hence effectively emitting 0-valued bits as the output. To use this fact, all of the instructions are first alphabetically ordered at table creation time, so that instructions that start with trailing zeroes become located higher in the table (further from the signal source). This allows for a maximum number of cells to be replaced with absent units to represent 0-valued bits. In fact, the instruction for no-ops is represented as all zeroes, so all of the units in the value module are replaced by absent cells. The no-op instruction appears a lot of times immediately after the jump operation, due to the fact that the QFT architecture has a branch delay when invoking a jump instruction, requiring a no-op instruction to be present to compensate for the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Added new optimized instructions to the ALU, and removed unused ones&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I removed the &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SL&lt;/code&gt; (shift left), &lt;code&gt;SRL&lt;/code&gt; (shift right logical), and the &lt;code&gt;SRA&lt;/code&gt; (shift right arithmetical) opcodes, and added the &lt;code&gt;SRU&lt;/code&gt; (shift right unit) and &lt;code&gt;SRE&lt;/code&gt; (shift right eight) opcodes to the architecture. Since there already were opcodes for &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt; (bitwise-xor) and &lt;code&gt;ANT&lt;/code&gt; (bitwise-and-not), &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;, which were not used much in the interpreter, could be replaced by these opcodes. The bitshift operations had significantly larger patterns than the other opcodes, being more than 10 times larger than the other opcodes. These were reduced to a fixed-size shift operations which could be implemented in the same sizes as the other opcodes. Since the shift left opcode can be replaced by consecutively adding its own value, effectively multiplying by powers of 2, the opcode was safely removed. The main reason for the original bitshift units being large was due to the shift amounts being dependent on the values of the RAM. Converting a binary value to a physical (in-pattern) shift amount required a large pattern. On the other hand, shifting a fixed value could be implemented by a significantly more simpler pattern. The shift right eight instruction is mainly used for reading out the standard input, where each ASCII character in the input string is packed into one 16-bit RAM memory address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This resulted in a total of exactly 8 opcodes, &lt;code&gt;ANT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SRE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SRU&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SUB&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MLZ&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;MNZ&lt;/code&gt;. Since this can fit in 3 bits, the opcode region for the instruction value was reduced by 1 bit. Since the RAM module is 10 bits, and the third value of the instruction is always the writing destination of the RAM, and the first instruction can also be made so that it becomes the reading source address of the RAM, this allows for an additional 6*2=12 bits to be reduced from the instruction length. These altogether has reduced the ROM word size from 58 to 45 bits, reducing nearly 1/4 of the original instruction size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Extended the ROM and RAM address space from 9,7-bit to 12,10-bit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original QFT architecture had a ROM and RAM address space of 9 and 7 bits. I extended the ROM and RAM address space to 12 and 10 bits, respectively. This was not a straightforward task as it first seemed, since the signal arrival timings between the modules had to be carefully adjusted in order for the signals to line up correctly. This involved reverse-engineering and experimenting undocumented VarLife pattern units used in the original QFT architecture. The same held for when redesigning other parts of the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Reducing the Standard Input Size&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since each byte of the RAM module can be ordered arbitrarily in the CPU’s architecture, the RAM is arranged so that the standard output is written at the very bottom of the RAM module, and proceeds upwards. Therefore, the contents of the RAM can easily be observed in a Game of Life viewer by directly examining the bottom of the RAM module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since RAM has 16 bits of memory per memory address, it allows to fit two ASCII-encoded characters per one address. Therefore, the standard input is read out by reading two characters per address. For the standard output, one character is written to one address for aesthetic reasons, so that the characters can be directly observed in a Game of Life viewer the pattern more easily. Also, for the standard output to proceed upwards within the RAM module pattern, the memory pointer for the standard output proceeds backwards in the memory space, while the pointer for the standard input proceeds forwards in the memory space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Game of Life layer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optimizing the Game of Life layer mainly revolved around understanding the Macrocell format for representing and saving Game of Life patterns, and the Hashlife algorithm. The Macrocell format uses quadtrees and memoization for compressing repeated patterns. Since the final Game of Life pattern is an array of OTCA metapixels which are 2048x2048 large, and even has repeated patterns in the VarLife layer (meaning that there are repeated configurations of OTCA metapixels), this compression reduces the file size for the QFT pattern significantly. The best example that let me understand the Macrocell format was an example provided by Adam P. Goucher in this thread in Golly’s mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hashlife algorithm also uses quadtrees and memoization to speed up the Game of Life simulations. This algorithm makes use of the fact that the same pattern in a same time frame influences only a fixed extent of its surrounding regions, hence allowing for memoization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for optimization, I first noticed that the QFT pattern had a 1-pixel high pattern concatenated to the entire pattern. The original QFT pattern in the original QFT repository was carefully designed so that it is composed of 8x8-sized pattern units. Therefore, most of the patterns can be represented by 8x8 tiles. However, since the 1-pixel high pattern at the top creates an offset that shifts away the pattern from this 8x8 grid, it causes the pattern to have fewer repeated patterns if interpreted from the corner of its bounding box, causing the memoization to work inefficiently. I therefore tried putting a redundant cell (which does not interfere with the rest of the pattern) to realign the entire pattern to its 8x8 grid, which actually slightly reduced the resulting Macrocell file size from the original one. Although I didn’t compare the running times, since the Hashlife algorithm uses memoization over repeated patterns as well, I expect this optimization to at least slightly contribute to the performance of the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another optimization was improving the metafier script used to convert VarLife patterns to Game of Life (MetafierV3.py). The original script used a square region to fit the entire pattern to create the quadtree representation. However, since the Lisp in Life VarLife pattern is 968 pixels wide but 42354 pixels high, it tried to allocate a 65536x65536-sized integer array, which was prohibitively large to run. I modified the script so that it uses a rectangular region, where absent regions of the quadtree are represented as absent cells. Although this is very straightforward with the knowledge of the Macrocell format, it was difficult at first until I became fond of the algorithms surrounding the Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Memory Region Map and the Phases of Operation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memory region map is carefully designed to save space. This is best described with the operation phases of the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Phase 0: Precalculations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Various precalculations are done after the interpreter starts running. The construction of the string interning hashtable for reserved atoms such as &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;quote&lt;/code&gt;, etc. are done in this phase. For the GCC-compiled interpreter, some variables that are defined in the QFT memory header are defined in the C source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the outcome of these precalculations are always the same for any incoming Lisp program, this phase is done on the host PC, and the results are saved as ramdump.csv during the QFTASM compile time. The results are then pre-loaded into the RAM when the VarLife and Game of Life patterns are created. This allows to saves some CPU cycles when running the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As explained earlier, the QFT architecture holds register values in the RAM. There are 11 registers, which are placed in the addresses from 0 to 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reserved values in the image include strings such as reserved atoms and the destinations of the jump hashtable used for evaluation. The rest of the region is used for storing global variables in the interpreter’s C source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Phase 1: Parsing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lisp program provided from the standard input is parsed into S-expressions, which is written into the heap region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that the string interning hashtables are created in the later end of the stack region. This is because these hashtables are only used during the parsing phase, and can be overwritten during the evaluation phase. For most Lisp programs including the ones in this repository, the stack region does not grow far enough to overwrite these values. This allows to place 3 growing memory regions during the parsing phase, the stack region used for nested S-expressions, the heap region which stores the parsed S-expressions, and the string interning hashtables when new strings are detected within the Lisp program. Newly detected strings such as variable names in the Lisp program are also written into the heap region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The heap region is also designed so that it overwrites the standard input as it parses the program. Since older parts of the program can be discarded once it is parsed, this allows to naturally free the standard input region which save a lot of space after parsing. The standard input also gets overwritten by the Standard output if the output is long enough. However, due to this design, long programs may have trouble at parsing, since the input may be overwritten too far and get deleted before it is parsed. A workaround for this is to use indentation which places the program further ahead into the memory, which will prevent the program from being overwritten from the growing heap region. For all of the programs included in this repository, this is not an issue and the programs become successfully parsed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Phase 2: Evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By this time, all of the contents of the stack region and what is ahead of the head of the heap region can be overwritten in the further steps. Note that a similar issue with the standard input happens with the standard output - when too many Lisp objects are created during runtime, it may overwrite the existing standard output, or may simply exceed the heap region and proceed into the stack region. Since the heap region is connected to the later end of the stack region, this may be safe if the standard output is carefully handled, but the interpreter will eventually start overwriting values of the stack region if the heap continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How can a 2-state OTCA Metapixel emulate the behavior of an 8-state VarLife pattern?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is one of the most interesting ideas in the original QFT project to make the QFT architecture possible. As explained in the original QFT post, the 8 states of VarLife are actually a mixture of 4 different birth/survival rules with binary states. This means that each VarLife cell can only transition between two fixed states, and the birth/survival rule for that cell does not change at any point in time. Moreover, the OTCA Metapixel is designed so that each metapixel can carry its own birth/survival rules. Therefore, each VarLife cell can be enoded into an OTCA Metapixel by specifying its birth/survival rule and the binary state. This means that the array of OTCA Metapixels in the metafied pattern is actually a mixture of metapixels with different birth/survival rules, arranged in a way so that it makes the computation possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Halting Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the program counter is set to 65535 and the program exits, no more ROM and RAM I/O signals become apparent in the entire module. This makes the VarLife pattern becomes completely stationary, where every pattern henceforth becomes completely identical. Defining this as the halting time for the calculation, the pattern for print.lisp halts at exactly 105,413,068 VarLife generations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The halting time for the Game of Life patterns are defined similarly for the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels. Since OTCA Metapixels never become stationary, the Game of Life states do not become stationary after the halting time, but the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels will become stationary after the halting time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the VarLife pattern of print.lisp, by generation 105,387,540, the value 65535 gets written to the program counter. At generation 105,413,067, the last signal becomes just one step from disappearing, and at generation 105,413,068 and onwards, the pattern becomes completely stationary and every pattern becomes identical to each other. In the Game of Life version, since the OTCA Metapixel continues running indefinitely, the pattern does not become completly stationary, but the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels will become completely stationary, since it is an emulation of the VarLife pattern. Note that the halting times for programs other than print.lisp is just a sufficient number of generations, and not the exact values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The required number of generations per CPU cycle depends on many factors such as the ROM and RAM addresses and the types of opcodes, since the arriving times of the I/O signals depend on factors such as these as well. This makes the number of generations required for the program to halt become different between each program. For example, print.lisp has a rate of 23822.16 generations per CPU cycle (GpC), but z-combinator.lisp has a rate of 28870.81 GpC, and primes-print.lisp has 31502.43 GpC. 23822.16 GpC is in fact insufficient for z-combinator.lisp to finish running, and 28870.81 is also insufficient for primes-print.lisp to finish running.&lt;/p&gt;

From the left are the modules for the &lt;code&gt;ANT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SRE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SRU&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SUB&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MLZ&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;MNZ&lt;/code&gt; opcodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;SRE&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;SRU&lt;/code&gt; opcodes were newly added for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The CPU architecture used in this project was originally created by the members of the Quest For Tetris (QFT) project, and was later optimized and modified by Hikaru Ikuta for the Lisp in Life project. The VarLife cellular automaton rule was also defined by the members of the QFT project. The metafier for converting VarLife patterns to Conway’s Game of Life patterns was written by the members of the QFT project, and was later modified by Hikaru Ikuta to support the pattern size of the Lisp in Life architecture. The assembly language for the QFT architecture, QFTASM, was also originally designed by the members of the QFT project, and was later modified by Hikaru Ikuta for this project for achieving a feasible running time. The Lisp interpreter was written by Hikaru Ikuta. The compilation of the interpreter’s C source code to the ELVM assembly is done using an extended version of 8cc written by Rui Ueyama from Google. The compilation from the ELVM assembly to QFTASM is done by an extended version of ELVM (the Esoteric Language Virtual Machine), a project by Shinichiro Hamaji from Preferred Networks, Inc. The Game of Life backend for ELVM was written by Hikaru Ikuta, and was later further extended by Hikaru for the Lisp in Life project.&lt;/p&gt;

A plea for help</title><link>https://hey.paris/posts/appleid/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="adccd91d0b62015c"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summary: A major brick-and-mortar store sold an Apple Gift Card that Apple seemingly took offence to, and locked out my entire Apple ID, effectively bricking my devices and my iCloud Account, Apple Developer ID, and everything associated with it, and I have no recourse. Can you help? Email paris AT paris.id.au (and read on for the details). ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how Apple “Permanently” locked my Apple ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am writing this as a desperate measure. After nearly 30 years as a loyal customer, authoring technical books on Apple’s own programming languages (Objective-C and Swift), and spending tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of dollars on devices, apps, conferences, and services, I have been locked out of my personal and professional digital life with no explanation and no recourse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Situation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Apple ID, which I have held for around 25 years (it was originally a username, before they had to be email addresses; it’s from the iTools era), has been permanently disabled. This isn’t just an email address; it is my core digital identity. It holds terabytes of family photos, my entire message history, and is the key to syncing my work across the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Trigger: The only recent activity on my account was a recent attempt to redeem a $500 Apple Gift Card to pay for my 6TB iCloud+ storage plan. The code failed. The vendor suggested that the card number was likely compromised and agreed to reissue it. Shortly after, my account was locked.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;An Apple Support representative suggested that this was the cause of the issue: indicating that something was likely untoward about this card.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The card was purchased from a major brick-and-mortar retailer (Australians, think Woolworths scale; Americans, think Walmart scale), so if I cannot rely on the provenance of that, and have no recourse, what am I meant to do? We have even sent the receipt, indicating the card’s serial number and purchase location to Apple.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Consequence: My account is flagged as “closed in accordance with the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Damage: I effectively have over $30,000 worth of previously-active “bricked" hardware. My iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Macs cannot sync, update, or function properly. I have lost access to thousands of dollars in purchased software and media.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Apple representatives claim that only the “Media and Services” side of my account is blocked, but now my devices have signed me out of iMessage (and I can’t sign back in), and I can’t even sign out of the blocked iCloud account because… it’s barred from the sign-out API, as far as I can tell.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I can’t even login to the “Secure File Transfer” system Apple uses to exchange information, because it relies on an Apple ID. Most of the ways Apple has suggested seeking help from them involve signing in to an Apple service to upload something, or communicate with them. This doesn’t work as the account is locked.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I can’t even download my iCloud Photos, as:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;There are repeated auth-errors on my account, so I can’t make Photos work;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I don’t have a 6TB device to sync them to, even if I could.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Support Nightmare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I contacted Apple Support immediately (Case ID: 102774292094). The experience was terrifyingly dismissive:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No Information: Support staff refused to tell me why the account was banned or provide specific details on the decision.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No Escalation: When I begged for an escalation to Executive Customer Relations (ECR), noting that I would lose the ability to do my job and that my devices were useless, I was told that “an additional escalation won’t lead to a different outcome”.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Many of the reps I’ve spoken to have suggested strange things, one of the strangest was telling me that I could physically go to Apple’s Australian HQ at Level 3, 20 Martin Place, Sydney, and plead my case. They even put me on hold for 5 minutes while they looked up the address.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The “New Account” Trap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most insultingly, the official advice from the Senior Advisor was to “create a new Apple account… and update the payment information”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This advice is technically disastrous:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Legal Catch: Apple’s Terms and Conditions rely on “Termination of Access.” By closing my account, they have revoked my license to use their services.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Technical Trap: If I follow their advice and create a new account on my current devices (which are likely hardware-flagged due to the gift card error), the new account will likely be linked to the banned one and disabled for circumventing security measures.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Developer Risk: As a professional Apple Developer, attempting to “dodge” a ban by creating a new ID could lead to my Developer Program membership being permanently blacklisted, amongst other things.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who I Am&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not a casual user. I have literally written the book on Apple development (taking over the Learning Cocoa with Objective-C series, which Apple themselves used to write, for O’Reilly Media, and then 20+ books following that). I help run the longest-running Apple developer event not run by Apple themselves, /dev/world. I have effectively been an evangelist for this company’s technology for my entire professional life. We had an app on the App Store on Day 1 in every sense of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Plea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am asking for a human at Apple to review this case. I suspect an automated fraud flag regarding the bad gift card triggered a nuclear response that frontline support cannot override. I have escalated this through my many friends in WWDR and SRE at Apple, with no success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am desperate to resolve this and restore my digital life. If you can help, please email paris AT paris.id.au&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In my 30’s, I exercised to look good. In my 50’s, to stay fit. In my 70’s, to stay ambulatory. In my 80’s, to avoid assisted living. Now in my 90’s, I’m just doing it out of pure defiance&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago I found The Dick Van Dyke Show free to watch on Youtube. I had seen a number of the episodes in passing over the years, but never really watched it. It's really quite a good show. Highly recommended, even if YouTube's viewing experience for TV series is sub-par.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE Dick van Dyke, from Mary Poppins, Diagnosis: Murder, ans so many more?! I always thought it was just a coincidental same name as I never saw videos about this. Oh my! This guy is amazing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no idea he's an animator, that's so cool! In that video he says "Lightwave is so deep, I won't live long enough to see everything that's in it". I'm glad he's proven wrong there!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know his son Barry. He said his first memory he has was his Dad doing real time drawings for people telling stories. He was behind the story teller on stage on giant pads of paper as a comedy bit at night clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He also remembers having giant bags of toys dumped on the floor of the hotel rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many A-listers are polymaths. For example, Phil Hartman, used to be Phil Hartmann (extra "n"), and designed some of the most iconic album covers of the 1970s, and Steve Martin is one of the best banjo players out there. It used to be part of his standup bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dick Van Dyke came from the tail end of Vaudeville, where performers had to have a whole variety of skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: Every one of these folks that hits the limelight, beat out thousands of others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We think our vocation is competitive? Showbiz says "Hold my beer."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just looked it up and saw he did an album cover for Steely Dan. It reminded me that Chevy Chase was an early drummer for Steely Dan (well, before they became "Steely Dan")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hedy Lamarr was a prolific inventor. Among other things, she developed a frequency-hopping spread spectrum radio transmission technique for torpedo guidance and donated the patent to the US Navy during WW2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Steve Martin is one of the best banjo players out there&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he’s great with a lasso!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love his albums with Edie Brickell, he’s good with Steep Canyon Rangers, and more recently have heard him shine with Alison Brown (banjo), Sierra Hull (mandolin), and others in his latest tour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the top banjo players technically, you might check out Béla Fleck, Jens Kruger, Noam Pikelny, Tony Trischka, Bill Keith, Don Reno, and Earl Scruggs. I’ve personally heard superhuman performances by Jens Kruger in-person and I grew up on Scruggs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Makes sense. My grandpa is one year his junior and you would never see him react too strongly to anything, even though grandma (also still alive) always had an, ahem, fiery personality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also he refuses to sit and moves around all the time, venturing outside every day from their apartment four floors above ground without a lift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly his own father didn't make it to his 60s, so there's certainly a lifestyle component to this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why We Built Another Object Storage (And Why It's Different)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-performance object storage exists, but the economics make it unusable at scale. FractalBits breaks out of the high-performance trap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Crowded Market, But An Unsolved Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Object storage is the backbone of modern data infrastructure. AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO, Ceph, newer players like Tigris Data—the market is saturated. So why build another one?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the fundamental assumptions behind these systems are shifting. High performance is no longer optional—but having high performance available isn’t the same as being able to afford using it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Beyond “Cold Storage”: Why Performance Matters Now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional object storage had a clear priority order: cost first, performance later. This worked fine for archiving backups and storing large, rarely accessed files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But today, object storage is increasingly the primary data layer for AI, analytics, and cloud-native applications. Latency directly translates to compute costs—stalled GPUs waiting on I/O are expensive GPUs doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-performance object storage exists now. S3 Express One Zone, for example, delivers single-digit millisecond latency. But there’s a catch: the per-request pricing makes it prohibitively expensive to actually use at high IOPS. As one analysis put it, it’s “the right technology, at the right time with the wrong price” [1]. You have the performance on paper, but you can’t afford to run your workload at full speed. That’s the high-performance trap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The New Challenge: AI and Analytical Workloads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern workloads, especially in AI, impose demands that strain traditional designs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small Objects at Scale: AI training datasets often consist of millions of small files (images, text snippets, feature vectors). A study of typical AI training workloads found over 60% of objects are 512KB or smaller [2]. This shifts the bottleneck from bandwidth to metadata performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency Sensitivity: Training loops and inference pipelines are bottlenecked by I/O. When fetching thousands of small objects per batch, per-object latency compounds quickly, stalling expensive GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Need for Directories: S3’s flat namespace is a mismatch for many workflows. Data scientists expect atomic renames and efficient directory listings—operations that are either slow or missing in classic object stores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;”Why Not Just Use a Filesystem?”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reasonable question: if you want directories and atomic rename, why not just use a filesystem like AWS EFS? Object stores and filesystems are different concepts—why blur the line?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is that the line is already blurring, driven by real workload demands. AWS themselves recognized this when they introduced S3 Express One Zone with explicit “directory bucket” semantics and atomic rename support (currently single-object) [3]. Google Cloud has made similar moves toward hierarchical namespace support [4]. The industry is converging on this because the clean separation between “object storage for scale” and “filesystem for semantics” doesn’t match how modern applications actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re not trying to build a POSIX filesystem. But the subset of filesystem semantics that matter for data workflows—efficient directory listings, atomic rename for safe data handoffs—these belong in object storage. The alternative is forcing every application to build fragile workarounds on top of a flat namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where Current Solutions Hit a Wall&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing systems struggle with these patterns in predictable ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The High-Performance Trap: High-performance tiers like S3 Express One Zone solve the latency problem, but the per-request cost means you can’t actually use that performance at scale. At 10K PUT/s, you’re looking at ~$29K/month in request fees alone. The performance is there; the economics aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Small Object Tax: With cloud object storage, you pay per request. Storing billions of 4KB objects means your API request costs can exceed your storage costs. The more objects you have, the worse it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing Directory Semantics: The lack of atomic rename forces complex workarounds in applications, limiting what you can build directly on object storage. Most systems with rename support rely on inode-like structures that struggle with scalability and performance—adding to the per-IOPS cost burden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introducing FractalBits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built FractalBits to break out of the high-performance trap: delivering performance you can actually afford to use at scale. In our benchmarks, we achieved nearly 1M GET/s on 4KB objects with a cluster totaling 64 cores across all data and metadata nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our focus:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High IOPS at a cost that makes sense—so you can actually run your workload at full speed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native directory semantics, including atomic rename.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Strong consistency—no eventual consistency surprises.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Cost Difference&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what the gap looks like for a small-object intensive workload (4KB objects, 10K IOPS):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Metric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;S3 Express One Zone&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;FractalBits&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Reduction&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Monthly Cost for 10K PUT/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~$29,290&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~$166&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~150×&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Monthly Cost for 10K GET/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~$778&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~$42&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~15×&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Storage (1 TB Per Month)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~$110&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$0 (included)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;—&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;S3 costs based on public pricing ($0.00113/1K PUTs, $0.00003/1K GETs, $0.11/GB/Month). FractalBits estimated using 1-year reserved instance pricing for required compute (e.g., i8g.2xlarge for data, m7g.4xlarge for metadata). Your savings will vary based on workload, but the magnitude is indicative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Key: Our Metadata Engine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At our core is a metadata engine built on an on-disk radix tree, optimized for path-like keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most object stores use LSM-trees (good for writes, variable read latency) or B+ trees (predictable reads, write amplification). We chose a radix tree because it naturally mirrors a filesystem hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prefix Sharing: Common path segments (e.g., &lt;code&gt;/datasets/cifar10/&lt;/code&gt;) are stored once, saving memory and speeding up traversal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efficient Directory Operations: Listing a directory becomes a subtree scan. Atomic rename is essentially updating a pointer at the branch point, not copying data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crash Consistency: We use physiological logging to ensure metadata integrity and fast recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike most systems that use inode-based (or inode-like) structures to support directory features, we use a full-path approach for better scalability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, we implemented the core engine in Zig for control and predictable performance.&lt;lb/&gt; Why Zig?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;comptime&lt;/code&gt;metaprogramming generates optimized code paths for different node types at compile time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manual memory management means no GC pauses and predictable latency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct SIMD access for parallel key comparisons within tree nodes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;io_uring in std library, so that we can easily try more recent io_uring kernel features (registered buffers, nvme IOPoll etc).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Gateway: Rust-Based S3-Compatible API server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our S3-compatible API server, built in Rust, manages the data path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safety &amp;amp; Concurrency: Rust’s ownership model gives us thread safety without a garbage collector—important for high-concurrency request handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Async I/O: Built on Tokio for handling thousands of concurrent connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Production-Ready Frameworks: We support both axum and actix-web, defaulting to actix-web. Its thread-per-core architecture aligns with our design for maximum performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Model: Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FractalBits deploys as a managed software layer within your own cloud account (currently AWS only).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cost transparency—you pay the cloud provider’s raw costs for VMs and disks, no egress fees to us&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data sovereignty—your data never leaves your cloud tenant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low latency—deploy in the same region/VPC as your compute&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For us: We leverage the cloud’s proven infrastructure instead of building it from scratch, letting us focus on the storage engine itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The object storage market has high-performance options, but the economics often make that performance unusable at scale. And systems that do offer directory semantics often struggle with performance or scalability. Getting both at a reasonable cost is still rare. We think there’s room for a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FractalBits is our answer. We’re early in this journey and learning from users who are pushing these limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hitting the performance or cost wall with your current object storage? We’d be interested to hear about your use case.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a personal project recently, rewriting an old jQuery + Django project into SvelteKit. The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I've had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure I'm not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but I've failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isn't able to get AI's code quality within 90% of what I'd write by hand. Ideally, AI could get it's code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Press Release&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Multiple Chinese Nationals Indicted on Charges Related to Theft and Re-Sale of Restaurant Cooking Oil&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; For Immediate Release &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of Iowa &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DES MOINES, Iowa – A federal grand jury in Des Moines returned a nine-count indictment on December 9, 2025, charging multiple individuals with charges related to a racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to commit the offense of interstate transportation of stolen property, and money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As alleged in the Indictment, the charged Defendants committed thefts of used cooking oil, which can be refined into biodiesel fuel and re-sold. Defendants drove trucks to restaurants and stole and attempted to steal cooking oil from oil collection tanks located at restaurants throughout Iowa, and in Tennessee, Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Alabama, Illinois, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kentucky. Defendants then transported the stolen cooking oil to warehouses in Nevada and Ankeny, Iowa; Lewisburg, Tennessee; Dora, Alabama; and Tipp City, Ohio. Defendants subsequently sold the stolen cooking oil and laundered the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following individuals are charged in the Indictment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tianzhu Chen, 33, of Flushing, New York, is charged with racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate, two counts of interstate transportation of stolen property, and two counts of money laundering.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jingliu Chen, 55, of Flushing, New York, is charged with conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yong Chen, 32, of Brooklyn, New York, is charged with racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate, and two counts of interstate transportation of stolen property.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Xian Quan Guo, 48, of Des Moines, Iowa, is charged with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jianfa Huang, 40, of Des Moines, Iowa, is charged with racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate, and interstate transportation of stolen property.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fukang Wang, 37, of Staten Island, New York, is charged with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Futao Wang, 36, of Des Moines, Iowa, is charged with racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate, and interstate transportation of stolen property.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jie Wang, 30, of Dayton, Ohio, is charged with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Xiangjing Wang, 34, of Des Moines, Iowa, is charged with racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate, and two counts of interstate transportation of stolen property.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Danrong Zhang, 38, of Flushing, New York, is charged with conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate and money laundering.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Changxu Zou, 41, of Tulia, Texas, is charged with conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Changyu Zou, 38, of Edmond, Oklahoma, is charged with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wenrong Zou, 32, of Edmond, Oklahoma, is charged with conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In connection with the case, federal search warrants and arrest warrants were executed today in Iowa, Ohio, New York, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xian Quan Guo, Jianfa Huang, Futao Wang, and Xiangjing Wang made their initial court appearances today before a United States Magistrate Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Trial was set for February 2, 2026. The remaining defendants will make their initial court appearances in the Southern District of Iowa on later dates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;United States Attorney David C. Waterman of the Southern District of Iowa made the announcement.
