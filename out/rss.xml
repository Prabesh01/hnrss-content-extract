  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2023, Apple sunsetted (pun intended) the Dark Sky mobile app on iOS. Apple purchased the company behind the popular weather application in early 2020, then announced that it would be shutting down the Dark Sky applications (first on Android, then on iOS and web), and finally stated in 2022 that the forecast technology would be integrated into the Apple Weather app with iOS 16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dark Sky was much more than just an API or a set of “forecast technologies.” The design of the Dark Sky mobile application represented a hallmark of information design because the team clearly obsessed over how people would actually use the app on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a gallery of screenshots I personally took in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of Dark Sky was so wonderful that I could understand the shape of the weather at a glance, even from a zoomed out view of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Common use cases for a weather app&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we can dissect what makes the design of this app so special, let’s define the most common use cases for a weather app. A good weather app attempts to address a range of use cases in a person’s life. Here are some common use cases for a weather app, starting with the contextual goals first:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the questions I want to answer vary based on the context and situation I’m in. This is the perfect situation for software that embraces good information design principles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Magic Ink, Bret Victor defined information design “as the design of context-sensitive information graphics.” Unlike static graphics, like a weather map in a newspaper, information graphics in software can be highly dynamic and can incorporate context from the user’s environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark Sky aggressively leaned into these ideas, and the team worked hard to turn nearly everything in the application into a context-sensitive information graphic. Let’s dive deeper into some examples where this notion is in full display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weather forecast for the day at a precise location&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll start by listing my goals when trying to understand the upcoming weather for the day:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default experience for the Dark Sky application is to show weather for the next 12 hours at my precise location. Here are three screenshots from the app, from different days and locations. What do you notice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app contextualizes the information that’s presented based on what’s most relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the left-most screenshot, the context of the weather storm that’s passing by my location and some potential light rain is emphasized to the user. The wind advisory and dip in the “feels like” temperature also make honorable mentions. In combination with the clickable Wind Advisory warning, I can quickly understand that the storm has passed my specific location but I should still be mindful of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the middle screenshot, the storm front heading my direction, the imminent rain starting within the hour, and the hours of rain later in the day are emphasized front and center. Based on my interest in the rain, I scrolled down (not shown in screenshot) to switch from temperature to rain probability for the main weather view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the right-most screenshot, the temperature distribution throughout the day is emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of little details that are easy to miss, as well. For example, all three screenshots above start showing weather information starting at the current moment (“now”) and onwards. This is brilliant, because I only occasionally care about weather from a few hours or days ago. (To accommodate those situations, the app did have a unique Time Machine view to explore past weather data.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weather forecast for the week&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit our goals when trying to understand the weather for the week:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While many other weather apps focus on helping me understand the weather at the city level, the Dark Sky app differentiates itself by enabling me to understand the weather with a hyperlocal view. I can view the weather at specific addresses and landmarks and understand how the weather might be different in a city center compared to the towns around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, the Dark Sky app shows the weekly weather summary at my current location (screenshot on the left). I can contextualize the weekly weather view by clicking the search icon and typing in the alternative location I’m interested in (screenshot on the right).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a glance, I can quickly understand:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which days are likely to rain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which days have wide temperature ranges (low lows and high highs).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The general shape of the weather (micro-trends).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gallery of subtle design elements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first few sections, I laid the groundwork by diving a bit more deeply into specific aspects of Dark Sky. Now that I’ve hopefully engaged your critical design eye, I’d like to elevate other elements in the app’s design in a more rapid-fire fashion. I hope that this section will provide some ideas and inspiration for people designing their own data-rich applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preserving temperature magnitudes in ranges&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To represent data visually, the data needs to be mapped from “data space” to “pixel space”. In some domains and scenarios, you want to ensure the magnitudes are carried over, and in others you want to rescale the values to a fixed scale so the resulting charts are more consistent in the space and pixels they take up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Dark Sky app, the “temperature pills” representing the forecasted temperatures for the upcoming week preserve their existing magnitude more effectively in the visualization. The temperature values are more tightly integrated with the visual representation, making the combined experience more amenable to quick comparison across multiple days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many weather apps opt for the design pattern on the right, where all temperature ranges are rescaled to take up the same amount of space in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacing numbers with rough categories&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interpreting hourly distributions of rainfall or snowfall can be difficult. Is 0.25 inches of rain a lot over the next hour? What about 0.2 inches of snow per hour for the next hour, then 0.15 for the hour after that? How do I prepare for these circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help users stay informed and take action, the app will often replace precise forecast distributions of rainfall and snowfall with rough categories instead. This design choice has two positive effects on users:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It contextualizes the forecast to simpler categories that can help us quickly make changes in our life if needed. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Light snow that starts and stops means that my snow shoveling company won’t come out, but heavy snow means they likely will.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Heavy snow means I should probably make sure my outdoor furniture is better covered and ready to take the snow.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It removes a sense of artificial precision that doesn’t really exist because weather forecasts fundamentally have very high uncertainty and error bands.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contextualized storm map&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple color scales combined with arrows go a very long way to conveying relevant storm information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wind direction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of conveying wind direction using text (“NW” or “Northwest”), the app uses arrows! If the wind shifts directions throughout the day, I can feel the wind direction changing using my body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Complaints from former Dark Sky users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I could probably write an entire book about the design of Dark Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I want to share some passionate comments from other Dark Sky fans. While most of them aren’t data viz or design nerds, they feel that the Apple Weather app is not a sufficient replacement. These people relied on Dark Sky to make decisions and grew very attached to an application that integrated deeply into their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;0000GKP on Reddit: “I have already made the transition to the Weather app. The information is presented in a much less efficient manner than Dark Sky so it takes more effort to get it, but it is all there (except for cloud cover).”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TheGeckoDude on Reddit: “Is there anything that has the precipitation graph similar to dark sky? The biggest thing I will miss from dark sky is that graph. I’m outside a lot and it is super helpful for knowing when to take cover or when it might rain. I need to find a feature like that because the vague weather precipitation info will not cut it for me.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s make data shine!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark Sky started with publicly available data, augmented it with contextualized predictions, rigorously iterated on data visualization design, and packaged all of this into a contextualized experience to make weather data useful for me in my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the availability of data has never been higher, we’re still missing software experiences that contextualize that data to make our lives better. Data alone isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world needs more Dark Sky-like experiences to help us improve our spending habits, help us sleep better, and more. If you’re working on information software, I hope you can be inspired by the body of design and engineering work that Dark Sky pioneered.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greetings from the year of Linux on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I replaced Windows with Linux and everything’s going great&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux diary, chapter one: winging it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux diary, chapter one: winging it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In November, I got fed up and said screw it, I’m installing Linux. Since that article was published, I have dealt with one minor catastrophe after another. None of that has anything to do with Linux, mind you. It just meant I didn’t install it on my desktop until Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goal here is to see how far I can get using Linux as my main OS without spending a ton of time futzing with it — or even much time researching beforehand. I am not looking for more high-maintenance hobbies at this stage. I want to see if Linux is a wingable alternative to Microsoft’s increasingly annoying OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly? So far it’s been fine. Many things I expected to be difficult — like getting my Nvidia graphics card working properly — were perfectly straightforward. A few things I thought would be simple weren’t. And I’ve run into one very funny issue with a gaming mouse that only works in games. But I’ve been able to use my Linux setup for work this week, I played exactly one video game, and I even printed something from my accursed printer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Day one&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I picked CachyOS rather than a better-known distro like Ubuntu because it’s optimized for modern hardware, and I had heard that it’s easy to install and set up for gaming, which is one of the reasons I’d stuck with Windows for this long. After backing up my Windows image sometime in December (close enough), I follow the installation instructions in the Cachy wiki and download the CachyOS live image to a Ventoy USB drive, plug it into my PC, reboot into the BIOS to disable Secure Boot, reboot again into the Ventoy bootloader, and launch the CachyOS disk image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First challenge: My mouse buttons don’t work. I can move the cursor, but can’t click on anything. I try plugging in a mouse (without unplugging the first one), same deal. Not a major issue; I can get around fine with just the keyboard. Maybe this is just an issue with the live image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I launch the installer and am thrust into analysis paralysis. An operating system needs lots of little pieces to work — stuff you don’t even think of as individual components if you use Mac or Windows. How do you boot into the OS? What runs the desktop environment? How are windows drawn? What’s the file system? Where do you get software updates? In Mac and Windows, all those decisions are made for you. But Linux is fundamentally different: The core of the OS is the kernel, and everything else is kind of up to you. A distro is just somebody’s idea of what pieces to use. Some, like Pop_OS! and Mint, aim for simplicity and make all those choices for you (though you can still change them if you want). But Cachy is based on Arch, a notoriously DIY distro, and before I do anything else, I have to pick one of four bootloaders. I pick Limine, for reasons I can’t recall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I need to figure out where to install it. On the recommendation of Will Smith from the Dual Boot Diaries podcast — from whom the “an operating system is a bunch of pieces” thing above is largely cribbed — I install Cachy on a different physical drive from Windows, since Windows updates tend not to care if they overwrite other bootloaders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a 4TB storage drive with just over a terabyte of data on it, so I shrink that partition down to 2TB using the installer’s manual partitioning interface, then (following the guide) make a 2GB boot partition and a root partition using the btrfs file system. The guide says it needs at least 20GB, so I go big and make it 100GB. This will cause a minor problem later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I have to pick one of thirteen different desktop environments. This is too many options. KDE and Gnome seem to be the best-supported for gaming, so I pick KDE. I could rabbit-hole on this, but I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then I just have to pick a username and password and name the computer. After some thought, I go with Maggie, after my in-laws’ cat, who half the family calls Linux. She doesn’t answer to either name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installation takes six minutes. I reboot the computer, and it loads into the Limine bootloader, which has also found my Windows install, so I can choose between Cachy and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I’m on the Cachy desktop, and my mouse buttons still aren’t working. Swapping USB ports doesn’t do anything. Plugging in my trackball doesn’t fix it either. I finally try unplugging the mouse, which makes the trackball work normally. My gaming mouse is an ancient Mad Catz Cyborg RAT 7; it turns out this is a known issue. I defer editing configuration files for now and just keep the mouse unplugged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stuff that works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That weird mouse aside, all of the hardware I’ve tried so far has just worked. Cachy automatically installed the correct GPU drivers; my monitor, speakers, and Logitech webcam work fine with no effort. Even my printer prints, with only a tweak to my firewall settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to install apps on Linux. Sometimes you can just download them from a company’s website, or you get them from your distro’s official repositories, or GitHub, or wherever. There’s no official app store for Linux, but there are at least three projects aiming to provide universal Linux apps: Flatpak, AppImage, and Snap. Neat! Commence hodgepodging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grab Chromium, Discord, Slack, and Audacity using the “Install Apps” button on Cachy’s welcome screen. Slack I get from the Arch User Repository. Twenty minutes later, I try to install 1Password from the same location, but the repository is down. I pick up my kid from a playdate and try again. It works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s missing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I prefer the Arc browser, which doesn’t have a Linux build, but there are plenty of browsers. Firefox and Chromium will do. I can’t find official apps for Airtable (which I use for work), Spotify, or Apple Music, but they all work fine in the browser in the short term, and I’ll revisit this later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Shall we play a game?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cachy has a one-click gaming package install that includes the Proton compatibility layer, Steam, and Heroic (a launcher for Epic, GOG, and Amazon). I figure I ought to try one game. Then I remember that my root partition is only 100GB. I reboot back into the Cachy live image and use the Parted utility to increase it to 1TB, then make a second btrfs partition in the remaining space. I reboot, log into Epic and GOG, and start downloading The Outer Worlds, a game from 2019 I’ve been playing a bit lately. It runs fine with Proton, and I can even sync my saves from the cloud. I play it for a few minutes with my trackball, remember I hate gaming on a trackball, and plug my gaming mouse back in. It works fine as long as I’m in the game, but outside the game, mouse clicks stop working again. It makes sense — the bug is on the desktop, not in games — but it’s very funny to have a gaming mouse that only works for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The children yearn for the mines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I’ve had so far is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. For some reason, Microsoft hasn’t prioritized making a Linux version of Bedrock. Java Edition works fine in Linux, but I play Minecraft with my kids, and they’re on Bedrock Edition on their iPads. There’s supposed to be a way to run the Android app with MCPE Launcher, but I couldn’t get it to work. There’s also a project to get the Windows version running on Proton, which will be my next step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stuff I haven’t tried yet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear good things about howdy, a Linux equivalent to Windows Hello face authentication, but I haven’t installed it yet. I hear the Zen browser is a good Arc alternative. I also haven’t gotten my cloud storage synced, configured git so I can compile programs from scratch, figured out a backup strategy, or tried much other hardware beyond what’s currently plugged into my computer. There’s a command-line Spotify player I want to try. I’ve only scratched the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did take the time to install a KDE Plasma theme that makes it look like Windows XP, though. Just because.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Regret level: none&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m well aware this is the honeymoon phase. And using Linux for less than a week isn’t exactly a flex. Many people use Linux. And I haven’t even tried doing anything particularly difficult, or playing a game that came out this decade. But so far it’s been a much easier transition than expected, and a quieter experience overall. My OS isn’t trying to change my browser or search engine to make some shareholder happy somewhere. It’s not nudging me to try some bullshit AI feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will I go crawling back to macOS or Windows the first time I have to edit a batch of photos? Possibly! I’ll definitely boot back into Windows — or pull out a Chromebook — to play Minecraft with my kids, if I can’t get it running on Linux. And I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use Linux exclusively; my job as a reviews editor means I have to stay familiar with as many operating systems as possible. (This is a good way to drive yourself nuts.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll run into plenty of fun problems soon enough. But the first few days have been great.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI is a business model stress test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI commoditizes anything you can specify. It can't commoditize what you have to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind Labs laid off 75% of its engineering team last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adam Wathan, CEO of Tailwind Labs, spent the holidays running revenue forecasts. In a GitHub comment, he explained what happened:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business. Traffic to our docs is down about 40% from early 2023 despite Tailwind being more popular than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story circulating is that AI is killing Open Source businesses. I don't think that is quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI didn't kill Tailwind's business. It stress tested it. Their business model failed the test, but that is not an indictment of all Open Source business models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind's business model worked for years. It relied on developers visiting their documentation, discovering Tailwind Plus while browsing, and buying it. Tailwind Plus is a $299 collection of pre-built UI components. Traffic led to discovery, and discovery drove sales. It was a reasonable business model, but always fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last year, more and more developers started asking AI for code instead of reading documentation, and their sales and marketing funnel broke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a fairness issue here that I don't want to skip past. AI companies trained their models on Tailwind's documentation and everything the community wrote about it. And now those models generate Tailwind code and answer Tailwind questions without sending anyone to Tailwind's website. The value got extracted, but compensation isn't flowing back. That bothers me, and it deserves a broader policy conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I keep coming back to is this: AI commoditizes anything you can fully specify. Documentation, pre-built card components, a CSS library, Open Source plugins. Tailwind's commercial offering was built on "specifications". AI made those things trivial to generate. AI can ship a specification but it can't run a business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does value live now? In what requires showing up, not just specifying. Not what you can specify once, but what requires showing up again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Value is shifting to operations: deployment, testing, rollbacks, observability. You can't prompt 99.95% uptime on Black Friday. Neither can you prompt your way to keeping a site secure, updated, and running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why Vercel created Next.js and gives it away for free. The Open Source framework is the conduit; the hosting is the product. Same with Acquia, my own company. A big part of Acquia's business model is selling products around Drupal: hosting, search, CI/CD pipelines, digital asset management, and more. We don't sell describable things; we sell operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open Source was never the commercial product. It's the conduit to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked what to pivot to, Wathan was candid: "Still to this day, I don't know what we should be pivoting to". I've written about how digital agencies might evolve, but CSS frameworks and component libraries are a harder case. Some Open Source projects make for great features, but not great businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind CSS powers millions of sites. The framework will survive. Whether the company does is a different question. I'm rooting for them. The world needs more successful Open Source businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In northern Germany, researchers have filmed brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) leaping from cave ledges to catch bats mid-flight — the first evidence that rodents can intercept flying mammals. The finding, published in Global Ecology and Conservation, turns one of ecology’s everyday characters into an unexpectedly agile predator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The behavior was recorded at Segeberg Kalkberg, a limestone cave that shelters around 30,000 hibernating bats each winter. Using infrared video over five weeks in autumn 2020 and thermal cameras from 2021 to 2024, a team led by Florian Gloza-Rausch in Bad Segeberg captured footage that’s unusual, for sure: a rat balancing on its hind legs at the cave entrance, sensing the movement of wings in the dark, then springing up to seize a bat from the air.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across five weeks of monitoring, the researchers confirmed 13 kills and found a hidden cache of 52 bat carcasses — clear signs that the rats weren’t scavenging leftovers but hunting deliberately. At that rate, a small group of rats could wipe out about 7% of the bat population in a single season.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s remarkable for an animal not built for flight or pursuit. Brown rats are omnivores that typically scavenge or prey on slow-moving targets. Yet here, they appear to have developed two hunting strategies: aerial interception at the cave mouth and ground attacks on bats crawling to roost. How the rats locate their targets in near-darkness isn’t fully clear, but researchers suspect they use whisker and hearing cues rather than sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar: Brain-Wide Map Shows How Prior Knowledge Guides Mouse Decisions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study describes this as unexpected behavioral plasticity in brown rats. The researchers believe the dense streams of bats and the narrow cave geometry created the perfect ambush zone — a place where a patient predator could learn a new trick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery also adds a new stressor to European bat populations, which are already under pressure from habitat loss and disease. Because brown rats are invasive across much of the continent, their access to major hibernation sites could have lasting ecological effects. The authors suggest managing rat presence near large roosts as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the most compelling part of the finding lies not in its numbers but in its image: a common city rat, usually seen raiding bins, now standing alert in a cave mouth, hunting with precision that blurs the line between scavenger and specialist. It’s a reminder that adaptation doesn’t always unfold in distant rainforests — sometimes it happens under our own streetlights, in ways no one thought to look for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Finding and Fixing Ghostty's Largest Memory Leak&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, users started reporting that Ghostty was consuming absurd amounts of memory, with one user reporting 37 GB after 10 days of uptime. Today, I'm happy to say the fix has been found and merged. This post is an overview of what caused the leak, a look at some of Ghostty's internals, and some brief descriptions of how we tracked it down.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leak was present since at least Ghostty 1.0, but it is only recently that popular CLI applications (particularly Claude Code) started producing the correct conditions to trigger it at scale. The limited conditions that triggered the leak are what made it particularly tricky to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix is merged and is available in tip/nightly releases, and will be part of the tagged 1.3 release in March.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The PageList&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand the bug, we first need to understand how Ghostty manages terminal memory. Ghostty uses a data structure called the &lt;code&gt;PageList&lt;/code&gt;
to store terminal content. PageList is a doubly-linked list of
memory pages that store the terminal content (characters, styles, hyperlinks,
etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The underlying "pages" are not single virtual memory pages but they are a contiguous block of memory aligned to page boundaries and composed of an even multiple of system pages.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These pages are allocated using &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; isn't particularly fast,
so to avoid constant syscalls, we use a memory pool. When we need
a new page, we pull from the pool. When we're done with a page, we return
it to the pool for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pool uses a standard size for pages. Think of it like buying standard-sized shipping boxes: most things people ship fit in a standard box, and having a standard box comes with various efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But sometimes terminals need more memory than a standard page provides. If a set of lines has many emoji, styles, or hyperlinks, we need a larger page. In these cases, we allocate a non-standard page directly with &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, bypassing the pool entirely. This is typically a
rare scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we "free" a page, we apply some simple logic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the page is &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= standard size&lt;/code&gt;: return it to the pool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the page is &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; standard size&lt;/code&gt;: call&lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;to free it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the core background for terminal memory management in Ghostty, and the idea itself is sound. A logic bug around an optimization is what produced the leak, as we'll see next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Scrollback Optimization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's one more background detail we need to cover to understand the bug: scrollback pruning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ghostty has a &lt;code&gt;scrollback-limit&lt;/code&gt; configuration that caps how much history
is retained. When you hit this limit, we delete the oldest pages in
the scrollback buffer to free up memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this often happens in a super hot path (e.g. when outputting large amounts of data quickly), and allocating and freeing memory pages is expensive, even with the pool. Therefore, we have an optimization: reuse the oldest page as the newest page when we reach the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This optimization works great. It requires zero allocations and uses only some quick pointer manipulations to move the page from the front to the back of the list. We do some metadata cleanup to "clear" the page but otherwise leave the previous memory intact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fast and empirically speeds up scrollback-heavy workloads significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Bug&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the scrollback pruning optimization, we always resized our page back to standard size. But we didn't resize the underlying memory allocation itself, we only noted the resize in the metadata. The underlying memory was still the large non-standard &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; allocation, but now the PageList thought it was standard
sized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, we'd free the page under various circumstances (e.g. when the user closes the terminal, but also other times). At that point, we'd see the page memory was within the standard size, assume it was part of the pool, and we would never call &lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt; on it.
A classic leak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all seems pretty obvious, but the issue is that non-standard pages are rare by design. The goal of our design and optimizations is that standard pages are the common case and provide a fast-path. Only very specific scenarios produce non-standard pages and they're usually not produced in large quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the rise of Claude Code changed this. For some reason, Claude Code's CLI produces a lot of multi-codepoint grapheme outputs which force Ghostty to regularly use non-standard pages. Additionally, Claude Code uses the primary screen and produces a significant amount of scrollback output. These things combined together created the perfect storm to trigger the leak in huge quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to be explicit that this bug is not Claude Code's fault. Claude Code is simply exercising Ghostty in a way that exposes this long-standing bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Fix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix is conceptually simple: never reuse non-standard pages. If we encounter a non-standard page during scrollback pruning, we destroy it properly (calling &lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;) and allocate a fresh
standard-sized page from the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of the fix is in the snippet below, but some extra work was needed to fix up some other bits of accounting we have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (first.data.memory.len &amp;gt; std_size) {
    self.destroyNode(first);
    break :prune;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could've also reused the non-standard page and just retained the large memory size, but until we have data that shows otherwise, we're still operating under the assumption that standard pages are the common case and it makes sense to reset back to a standard pooled page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other users have recommended more complex strategies (e.g. maintaining some metrics on how often non-standard pages are used and adjusting our assumptions accordingly), but more research is needed before making those changes. This change is simple, fixes the bug, and aligns with our current assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Finding the Leak with VM Tags&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the fix, I added support for virtual memory tags on macOS provided by the Mach kernel. This lets us tag our PageList memory allocations with a specific identifier that shows up in various tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;inline fn pageAllocator() Allocator {
    // In tests we use our testing allocator so we can detect leaks.
    if (builtin.is_test) return std.testing.allocator;

    // On non-macOS we use our standard Zig page allocator.
    if (!builtin.target.os.tag.isDarwin()) return std.heap.page_allocator;

    // On macOS we want to tag our memory so we can assign it to our
    // core terminal usage.
    const mach = @import("../os/mach.zig");
    return mach.taggedPageAllocator(.application_specific_1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now when debugging memory on macOS, Ghostty's PageList memory shows up with a specific tag instead of being lumped in with everything else. This made it trivial to identify the leak, associate it with the PageList, and also verify that the fix worked by observing the tagged memory being properly freed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preventing Leaks in Ghostty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do a lot of work in the Ghostty project to find and prevent memory leaks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In debug builds and unit tests, we use leak-detecting Zig allocators.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CI runs &lt;code&gt;valgrind&lt;/code&gt;on our full unit test suite on every commit to find more than just leaks, such as undefined memory usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We regularly run the macOS GUI via macOS Instruments to look for leaks particularly in the Swift codebase.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We run every GTK-related PR using Valgrind (the full GUI) to look for leaks in the GTK codepath that isn't unit tested.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has worked really well to date, but unfortunately it didn't catch this particular leak because it only triggers under very specific conditions that our tests didn't reproduce. The merged PR includes a test that does reproduce the leak to prevent regressions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the largest known memory leak in Ghostty to date, and the only reported leak that has been confirmed by more than a single user. We'll continue to monitor and address memory reports as they come in, but remember that reproduction is the key to diagnosing and fixing memory leaks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big thanks to @grishy who finally got me a reliable reproduction so I could analyze the issue myself. Their own analysis reached the same conclusion as mine, and the reproduction let me verify both our understandings independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks also to everyone who reported this issue with detailed diagnostics. The community's analysis, especially around the &lt;code&gt;footprint&lt;/code&gt; output and
VM region counting, gave me important clues that pointed toward the PageList
as the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code is Clay&lt;/head&gt;January 10, 2026&lt;p&gt;Kerri and I took a ceramics class recently!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made a hypercube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My instructor was... disappointed. The class was supposed to make a mug, or a bowl, something functional. But I had this idea in my head and couldn't shake it. The glaze turned out amazing (this iridescent blue that shifts in the light). I've been wondering if it would look even cooler painted in Vantablack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I've been noticing parallels between code and clay. They're both mediums. Vessels for ideas. You weren't thinking about hypercubes until you saw one on the coffee table, and now you might be picturing what a ceramic tesseract would even look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are malleable. When you're centering the clay, it's constantly moving, constantly responding. You push a little too hard and the whole thing wobbles off center. Same with code. You add a feature, refactor something, introduce a bug, fix three more. It's never static. It's never done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clay breaks. A lot. My first few attempts collapsed on the wheel. One piece cracked in the kiln. I dropped another walking to my car. But nobody cries about it, you just start over. The clay doesn't care. It's just material waiting for the next idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're gonna have a really bad time if you get too attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code is the same way. We're so precious about it sometimes, like every line is sacred. But it's not. It's just text. Delete it. Rewrite it. Start fresh. The idea survives even when the implementation doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before AI, we had to make every plate and coffee mug by hand. Every line of code, carefully typed. Every function, crafted manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now? We've hit the industrial revolution of code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the industrial revolution came for pottery, factories started pumping out ceramics. Plates got cheap. Mugs became disposable. You'd think clay would have disappeared. Why bother with the slow, messy, manual process when machines could do it faster?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But clay didn't go away. Ceramics studios are everywhere now. People pay good money to throw pots on weekends. Kerri and I are proof. The craft got more valuable once it wasn't necessary anymore. When you don't have to make something by hand, choosing to makes it mean something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software engineers love to joke about automating themselves out of a job. Well, we're finally getting there. LLMs can write code. A lot of it, fast. The industrial revolution is here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happens to us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the same thing that happened to potters. The production work gets automated. The commodity code writes itself. But the craft remains. The weird ideas, the hypercubes, the things that don't fit in templates: that's still us. That's still human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly I think I'm going to like it more. I got into programming because I liked building things, not because I wanted to type boilerplate for the rest of my life. If AI handles the mugs, I can focus on the hypercubes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medium isn't going anywhere. It's just getting more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i never said it was good)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — Private equity firms acquired more than 500 autism therapy centers across the U.S. over the past decade, with nearly 80% of acquisitions occurring over a four-year span.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s according to a new study from researchers at Brown University’s Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Study author Yashaswini Singh, a health economist at Brown’s School of Public Health, said the work highlights how financial firms are rapidly moving into a sensitive area of health care with little public scrutiny or data on where this is happening or why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The big takeaway is that there is yet another segment of health care that has emerged as potentially profitable to private equity investors, and it is very distinct from where we have traditionally known investors to go, so the potential for harm can be a lot more serious,” Singh said. “We're also dealing with children who are largely insured by Medicaid programs, so if private equity increases the intensity of care, what we're looking at are impacts to state Medicaid budgets down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings were published in JAMA Pediatrics and offer one of the first national assessments of private equity’s growing role in autism therapies and services. Autism diagnoses among U.S. children have risen sharply in recent years, nearly tripling between 2011 and 2022, and autism has been in the national spotlight amid political debate claiming links between autism and childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that investment has been concentrated in states with higher rates of autism diagnoses among children and states that have fewer limits on insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers identified a total of 574 autism therapy centers owned by private equity firms as of 2024, spanning 42 states. Most of those centers were acquired between 2018 and 2022, the result of 142 separate deals. The largest concentrations of centers were in California (97), Texas (81), Colorado (38), Illinois (36) and Florida (36). Sixteen states had one or no private equity-owned clinics at the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;States in the top third for childhood autism prevalence were 24% more likely to have private equity–owned clinics than others, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scale and speed of acquisitions underscore the growing trend of private equity’s entry into the market, the researchers say. According to Singh, the team was prompted to investigate that trend after hearing anecdotal reports from families and health providers about changes following private equity takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The primary concern is that private equity firms may prioritize financial gains over families, said Daniel Arnold, a senior research scientist at the School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It's all about the financial incentives,” Arnold said. “I worry about the same types of revenue-generating strategies seen in other private equity-backed settings. I worry about children receiving more than the clinically appropriate amount of services and worsening disparities in terms of which children have access to services.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To establish a baseline of where private equity firms are investing and why, the team used a mix of proprietary databases, public press releases and manual verification of archived websites to track changes in ownership. Unlike public companies, private equity firms and private practices are not required to disclose acquisitions, making data collection challenging and labor-intensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team is now seeking federal funding to examine how private equity ownership affects outcomes, including changes in therapy intensity, medication use, diagnosis age or how long children stay in treatment. They seek to determine whether these investments are helping to meet real needs or are primarily a way to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Private investors making a little bit of money while expanding access is not a bad thing, per se,” Singh said. “But we need to understand how much of a bad thing this is and how much of a good thing this is. This is a first step in that direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study received funding from the National Institute on Aging (R01AG073286) and the National Institute on Mental Health (R01MH132128).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;TLDR:&lt;p&gt; Librario is a book metadata API that aggregates data from Google Books, ISBNDB, and Hardcover into a single response, solving the problem of no single source having complete book information. It's currently pre-alpha, AGPL-licensed, and available to try now[0].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have a personal library with around 1,800 books. I started working on a library management tool for us, but I quickly realized I needed a source of data for book information, and none of the solutions available provided all the data I needed. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and another might provide a good cover, but none provided everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I started working on Librario, a book metadata aggregation API written in Go. It fetches information about books from multiple sources (Google Books, ISBNDB, Hardcover. Working on Goodreads and Anna's Archive next.), merges everything, and saves it all to a PostgreSQL database for future lookups. The idea is that the database gets stronger over time as more books are queried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see an example response here[1], or try it yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;  curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer librario_ARbmrp1fjBpDywzhvrQcByA4sZ9pn7D5HEk0kmS34eqRcaujyt0enCZ' \
  'https://api.librario.dev/v1/book/9781328879943' | jq .
  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is pre-alpha and runs on a small VPS, so keep that in mind. I never hit the limits in the third-party services, so depending on how this post goes, I’ll or will not find out if the code handles that well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The merger is the heart of the service, and figuring out how to combine conflicting data from different sources was the hardest part. In the end I decided to use field-specific strategies which are quite naive, but work for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each extractor has a priority, and results are sorted by that priority before merging. But priority alone isn't enough, so different fields need different treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Titles use a scoring system. I penalize titles containing parentheses or brackets because sources sometimes shove subtitles into the main title field. Overly long titles (80+ chars) also get penalized since they often contain edition information or other metadata that belongs elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Covers collect all candidate URLs, then a separate fetcher downloads and scores them by dimensions and quality. The best one gets stored locally and served from the server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most other fields (publisher, language, page count), I just take the first non-empty value by priority. Simple, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently added a caching layer[2] which sped things up nicely. I considered migrating from net/http to fiber at some point[3], but decided against it. Going outside the standard library felt wrong, and the migration didn't provide much in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database layer is being rewritten before v1.0[4]. I'll be honest: the original schema was written by AI, and while I tried to guide it in the right direction with SQLC[5] and good documentation, database design isn't my strong suit and I couldn't confidently vouch for the code. Rather than ship something I don't fully understand, I hired the developers from SourceHut[6] to rewrite it properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've got a 5-month-old and we're still adjusting to their schedule, so development is slow. I've mentioned this project in a few HN threads before[7], so I’m pretty happy to finally have something people can try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code is AGPL and on SourceHut[8].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback and patches[9] are very welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[0]: https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1]: https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/a6c3b1130133f384cffd25b3...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2]: https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[3]: https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[4]: https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[5]: https://sqlc.dev&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[6]: https://sourcehut.org/consultancy/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[7]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45419234&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[8]: https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[9]: https://git.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/tree/trunk/item/CONTRI...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bob Weir, Grateful Dead Co-Founder and Guitarist, Dead at 78&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Bob Weir, the singer, songwriter, guitarist, and co-founder of the Grateful Dead, whose songs about sunshine daydreams and truckin’ helped turn the jam band into a 60-year musical empire, has died at age 78.&lt;lb/&gt;“It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,” Weir’s family wrote in a statement. A date of death was not immediately available. “He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music,” the statement added. “His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them. Every chord he played, every word he sang was an integral part of the stories he wove. There was an invitation: to feel, to question, to wander, and to belong.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the band’s co-lead singer, writer, and guitarist beside Jerry Garcia, his elliptical riffs, eccentric song structures, and slightly off-kilter stage presence made him an intrinsic ingredient to the Dead, up to and beyond its demise following Garcia’s death in 1995. Weir often went under-recognized compared to the larger-than-life Garcia (one of the first songs he wrote in the Dead was called “The Other One”). Yet, the band’s bassist Phil Lesh characterized Weir’s contribution as that of “a stealth machine.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robert Hall Weir was born in San Francisco on October 16, 1947, to a college student who gave him up for adoption. He was raised in an affluent Bay Area suburb, where he managed to get kicked out of both preschool and the Cub Scouts, and suffered from undiagnosed dyslexia. At Fountain Valley, a Colorado school for boys with behavioral problems, he met John Perry Barlow, who would become his most frequent lyricist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weir began playing guitar at 13 and was soon hanging out at the Tangent, a Palo Alto folk club, where he performed bluegrass numbers with the Uncalled Four and first saw Garcia playing banjo during a “hoot” night. Weir picked up his first guitar licks from David Nelson and future Jefferson Airplane member Jorma Kaukonen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On New Year’s Eve, 1965, Weir and his friends heard banjo music emerging from Dana Morgan’s Music Store. He went in and found Garcia, and the two decided to form a band. The acoustic Mother McCree’s Uptown Jug Champions evolved into the electric Warlocks, who changed their name to the Grateful Dead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the youngest and best-looking member of the Dead, Weir had to pay some dues. Weir admitted that too much LSD during the group’s stint as house band for Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests made him withdrawn, especially as Garcia and bassist Phil Lesh were uniting more musically. “I was definitely low man on the totem pole,” he told Rolling Stone in 1989, “especially at the beginning. And for a long time I had to just shut up and take it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lyrics to “The Other One” described Weir’s introduction to both LSD and Neal Cassady, the trickster hero of Jack Kerouac’s beat-generation masterpiece On the Road, with whom Weir shared a room in the Dead’s infamous 710 Ashbury Street house. In 1968, Weir and fellow founding member Ron “Pigpen” McKernan were booted from the band for their musical deficiencies, though both returned within months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout the Seventies, Weir thrived as a member of a band that could deliver music of nearly ineffable warmth and country-rock majesty – as on their pair of 1970 masterpieces, Workingman’s Dead and American Beauty – while also playing more freely improvised music to countless listeners. Weir sang the band’s country covers and his own material, and played rhythm guitar in a brilliantly eccentric manner that belied the job’s second-string implications – even while soundman Dan Healy was turning him down in the mix. Lesh described Weir’s technique as “quirky, whimsical and goofy,” while Weir claimed jazz pianist McCoy Tyner’s left hand as his greatest influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Pigpen’s death in 1972, Weir stepped into the second-vocalist role smoothly. Ace, his first solo album, established him as the band’s second most fruitful songwriting source with solo songs-turned-Dead standards like “Playing in the Band,” “One More Saturday Night,” and “Cassidy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually alternating lead vocals with Garcia, he developed a repertoire that ranged from country-rock originals and rhythmically unorthodox tunes to his ambitious and gorgeous “Weather Report Suite.” He also began gigging outside the Dead with a vatiety of acts: First with Kingfish in 1974, then forming the Bob Weir Band with keyboardist Brent Mydland – who later joined the Dead – in the late Seventies. (They’d go on to release two albums with Bobby and the Midnites in the Eighties.) His second solo album, 1978’s Heaven Help the Fool, proved he could sound as slick as any other California rocker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of the Eighties, Weir would have to compensate onstage as Garcia sank into drug addiction – and later admitted that he also sometimes served as “bag man” for the guitarist’s drugs. Garcia temporarily recovered toward the end of the decade, an era Weir lauded as the Dead’s finest. “For me, that was our peak,” he told Rolling Stone in 2013. “We could hear and feel each other thinking, and we could intuit each other’s moves. Jerry, Brent, and I reached new plateaus as singers. We packed a punch.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though hit hard by Garcia’s August 1995 death, Weir continued to perform; as he famously sang in one Dead classic, “The Music Never Stopped.” His band RatDog played his Dead material and originals, and Weir eventually began singing Garcia’s own material in various 21st-century configurations of former Grateful Dead members, including the Other Ones, the Dead, and Furthur. After collapsing onstage with Furthur in 2013 and canceling RatDog performances in 2014, Weir admitted that he struggled with his own addiction to painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the remaining Grateful Dead members approached their golden anniversary in 2015, Weir was the first to support a reunion, telling Rolling Stone, “If there are issues we have to get past, I think that we owe it to ourselves to man up and get past them. If there are hatchets to be buried, then let’s get to work. Let’s start digging.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the surviving members’ Fare Thee Well concerts celebrating the Grateful Dead’s 50th anniversary in 2015, Weir enlisted one of the gig’s guests, John Mayer, to join him, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and other Dead associates in the new offshoot Dead &amp;amp; Company. That group would keep the spirit of the Dead alive for another decade, culminating in a 2023 “Final Tour” and two stints at Las Vegas’ Sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We speak a language that nobody else speaks,” Weir told Rolling Stone last March. “We communicate, we kick stuff back and forth, and then make our little statement in a more universal language. For us, it’s a look or a motion with one shoulder, or the way you reflect a phrase or something that tips off the other guys where you’re going with this. And then they work on being where you’re headed, getting there with a little surprise for you. That’s a formula that’s worked real well for us over the years, and there just aren’t enough of us left now to do that anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weir’s third and final solo studio album, Blue Mountain, arrived in 2016. Two years later, the guitarist embarked on yet another musical project as Bobby Weir and Wolf Bros, alongside bassist/producer Don Was and drummer Jay Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2024, shortly after the death of Dead bassist Phil Lesh, the Grateful Dead’s surviving members were recipients of the Kennedy Center honors. Dead &amp;amp; Company marked the Grateful Dead’s 60th anniversary with a three-night stand at San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park in August. Those concerts marked Weir’s final performances, ending his “long strange trip” onstage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Bobby’s final months reflected the same spirit that defined his life. Diagnosed in July, he began treatment only weeks before returning to his hometown stage for a three-night celebration of 60 years of music at Golden Gate Park. Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts. Another act of resilience,” Weir’s family added in their statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There is no final curtain here, not really. Only the sense of someone setting off again. He often spoke of a 300-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him. May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads. And so we send him off the way he sent so many of us on our way: with a farewell that isn’t an ending, but a blessing. A reward for a life worth livin’.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fast, lightweight text editor for Markdown, JSON, YAML, and TOML files. Built with Rust and egui for a native, responsive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;Platform Note: Ferrite has been primarily developed and tested on Windows. While it should work on Linux and macOS, these platforms have not been extensively tested. If you encounter issues, please report them.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Raw Editor&lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Split View&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Zen Mode&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Auto-Save - Configurable auto-save with temp-file safety&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line Numbers - Optional line number gutter&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Multi-agent orchestration system for Claude Code&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Sisyphus, these agents persist until every task is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install • Usage • Agents • Architecture • Website&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Day 0: oh-my-opencode was born. A multi-agent orchestration system. Beautiful. Powerful. Perhaps too powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Day ???: THE BANNING. They pulled the plug. They thought it was over.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Day ??? + 1: RESURRECTION. From the ashes rose oh-my-claude-sisyphus. Eleven agents. One mission.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today: The boulder rolls. The agents orchestrate. The chaos continues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Port of oh-my-opencode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claude-sisyphus/main/scripts/install.sh | bash&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install -g oh-my-claude-sisyphus&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Windows Users: This is the only supported installation method. Requires Node.js 18+.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claude-sisyphus.git
cd oh-my-claude-sisyphus
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The installer adds to your Claude Code config (&lt;code&gt;~/.claude/&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Check for and install updates&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# In Claude Code:

# Activate Sisyphus for a task
/sisyphus refactor the authentication module

# Set as default mode (persistent)
/sisyphus-default

# Use ultrawork for maximum performance
/ultrawork implement user dashboard with charts

# Deep search
/deepsearch API endpoints that handle user data

# Deep analysis
/analyze performance bottleneck in the database layer&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just include these words anywhere in your prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Activates parallel agent orchestration&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Deep analysis mode&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# These work in normal prompts too:
&amp;gt; ultrawork implement user authentication with OAuth

&amp;gt; find all files that import the utils module

&amp;gt; analyze why the tests are failing&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh-my-claude-sisyphus includes a silent auto-update system that checks for updates in the background. Updates are applied automatically without interrupting your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To manually check for updates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/update&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh-my-claude-sisyphus includes 18 lifecycle hooks that enhance Claude Code's behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Hook&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Magic keyword detection (ultrawork, search, analyze)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;ralph-loop&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Ensures todo list completion&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Background task completion notifications&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six builtin skills provide specialized capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Skill&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ultrawork&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Maximum performance with parallel agents&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ralph-loop&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Self-referential development until completion&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;frontend-ui-ux&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Designer-turned-developer UI/UX expertise&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Git expert for atomic commits and history&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are automatically activated via slash commands or magic keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;New in v1.8.0: Skills are no longer mutually exclusive. Claude automatically combines skills based on task requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills work in three composable layers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Layer&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Skills&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Purpose&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Execution&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;sisyphus, orchestrator, prometheus&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;HOW you work (pick primary)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Enhancement&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ultrawork, git-master, frontend-ui-ux&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ADD capabilities (stack multiple)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Guarantee&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ralph-loop&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ENSURE completion&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combination Formula: &lt;code&gt;[Execution] + [0-N Enhancements] + [Optional Guarantee]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude uses judgment to detect task type and activate appropriate skill combinations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Task Type&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sisyphus + ralph-loop&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;User emphasizes completion&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Components, styling&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complex debugging&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;oracle&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;sisyphus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Root cause → fix&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;Use the oracle agent to debug the memory leak in the worker process

Have the librarian find all documentation about the API

Ask explore to find all TypeScript files that import React

    &lt;p&gt;This is a port of oh-my-opencode adapted for Claude Code and the Claude Agent SDK. Here's what's different:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original oh-my-opencode used multiple AI providers. This port uses Claude models exclusively:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Agent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Original Model&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Ported Model&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Notes&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Was OpenAI's flagship for deep reasoning&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Claude-only? The Claude Agent SDK is designed for Claude models. Using Claude throughout provides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consistent behavior and capabilities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simpler authentication (single API key)&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Get details of a code action&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;lsp_servers&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Implemented&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;List available language servers&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: LSP tools require language servers to be installed (typescript-language-server, pylsp, rust-analyzer, gopls, etc.). Use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lsp_servers&lt;/code&gt;to check installation status.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Tool&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Pattern-based code search using AST matching&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ast_grep_replace&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Implemented&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Pattern-based code transformation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: AST tools use @ast-grep/napi for structural code matching. Supports meta-variables like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$VAR&lt;/code&gt;(single node) and&lt;code&gt;$$$&lt;/code&gt;(multiple nodes).&lt;/quote&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Architectural Changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plugin → Native Integration: Original was an OpenCode plugin; this uses Claude Code's native agent/command system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Provider → Single Provider: Simplified to Claude-only for consistency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom Runtime → Claude Code Runtime: Leverages Claude Code's built-in capabilities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Programmatic Config → Markdown Files: Agents defined as &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;files in&lt;code&gt;~/.claude/agents/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simpler Setup: One curl command vs. multi-step plugin installation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native Integration: Works directly with Claude Code, no plugin layer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consistent Behavior: All agents use Claude, no cross-model quirks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easier Customization: Edit markdown files to customize agents&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Model Diversity: Can't use GPT-5.2 for Oracle's deep reasoning&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Advanced Hooks: Fewer lifecycle interception points (22 hooks → system prompt enforcement)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're coming from oh-my-opencode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Oracle Tasks: Claude Opus handles architecture/debugging well, but differently than GPT-5.2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LSP Workflows: All LSP tools are available! Use &lt;code&gt;lsp_servers&lt;/code&gt;to check which servers are installed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AST Searches: Use &lt;code&gt;ast_grep_search&lt;/code&gt;with pattern syntax (e.g.,&lt;code&gt;function $NAME($$$)&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Background Tasks: Claude Code's &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt;tool with&lt;code&gt;run_in_background&lt;/code&gt;works similarly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Planning: Use &lt;code&gt;/plan&lt;/code&gt;command to start a planning session with Prometheus&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Code installed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic API key (&lt;code&gt;ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt;environment variable)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows: Node.js 18+ (for npm installation)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS/Linux: Bash shell (default) or Node.js 18+ (optional)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Bash (.sh)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced: Set&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SISYPHUS_USE_NODE_HOOKS=1&lt;/code&gt;to use Node.js hooks on macOS/Linux.&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A year of work on the ALPM project&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024 the Sovereign Tech Fund (STF) started funding work on the ALPM project, which provides a Rust-based framework for Arch Linux Package Management. Refer to the project's FAQ and mission statement to learn more about the relation to the tooling currently in use on Arch Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The funding has now concluded, but over the time of 15 months allowed us to create various tools and integrations that we will highlight in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have worked on six milestones with focus on various aspects of the package management ecosystem, ranging from formalizing, parsing and writing of file formats, over cryptographic verification of distribution artifacts, to package file and system package management handling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Formal specifications for packaging data formats"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Basic OpenPGP verification of artifacts"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Rust library for handling of individual packages"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Python bindings for alpm-srcinfo"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Distribution-agnostic OpenPGP stack for the verification of distribution artifacts"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Rust library for system package management"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are considering ourselves as part of a larger free software ecosystem. We believe that it makes sense to create value not only for our own niche, but for the greater good. As such, we focused on finding generic solutions to the technological problems we are facing as a distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are incredibly grateful for the support from STF without which this type of extensive ground work would not have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ALPM stats 📊&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of work has been done over the time of the STF funding. Below are a few statistics about the work done on the ALPM project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Specifications 📝&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Already in July we reported on the state of the specifications on the devblog and how they enable a deeper, shared view onto our current package management stack in Arch Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of custom file formats are in use in our ecosystem. Understanding how to use them is key to maintaining existing and envisioning new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interested developers and package maintainers are encouraged to browse them by file formats or concepts. Meanwhile, the alpm(7) specification provides a good high-level entry-point to the entire topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We hope this empowers a much larger group of contributors to participate in discussions about the concepts behind Arch Linux's package management. Additionally, we want to enable interested developers to participate in hacking both on the ALPM project itself, as well as make it much easier to experiment with new applications that are built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Foundational libraries 📚️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the ALPM project we chose a bottom-up, library first approach, in which libraries for basic tasks have been created iteratively in a workspace. As more libraries for specific use-cases emerge, it becomes possible to build more elaborate or special purpose tools with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We invite interested Rust developers to have a look at the dedicated API documentation to gain a better understanding and overview of the available libraries and their dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The central alpm-types library provides shared low-level types, which are used in some or all file formats used by the Arch Linux package management stack. These common types make it easy to build other, interoperable libraries on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In alpm-common, central traits and utility functionality are made available to other libraries in the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some consideration and research, we chose the winnow parser combinator library to create parsers for the various custom file formats. Shared functionality for parsers is made available in the alpm-parsers library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Package management systems usually revolve around central dependency resolver functionality. With alpm-solve we have created a new approach to this for Arch Linux, which is based on the generic resolvo library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compression is an integral part of the packaging workflow. It ensures that an alpm-package(7) or alpm-repo-db(7) file can be transferred over the network as fast as possible by reducing its size. With the alpm-compress library we have implemented extensible (de)compression for these files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To allow extraction of metadata and data files from an alpm-package(7) file, as well as (rudimentary) package creation, we have created the alpm-package crate. With it, it is possible to create package files from prepared input directories (which already contain relevant metadata and data files). In addition, it is possible to effortlessly iterate over the data files contained in a package file and to extract validated metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The creation process of an alpm-package(7) file requires to add root-owned files to a directory (e.g. as part of the installation process of an upstream project's build system). However, one does not want to run the package build process as root, but as an unprivileged user. For this purpose we have created the rootless-run library, which generically abstracts running commands "as root" with the help of different backends (e.g. &lt;code&gt;fakeroot(1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rootlesskit&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Libraries and command line interfaces 💻️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on specifications of file formats currently used in Arch Linux, we have created libraries that allow their parsing, validation and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, we distinguish between:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File formats used in an alpm-source-repo(7) (i.e. SRCINFO(5), PKGBUILD(5)),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;those in an alpm-repo-db(7) (i.e. alpm-repo-desc(5) and alpm-repo-files(5)),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;those in an alpm-db(7) (i.e. ALPM-MTREE(5), alpm-db-desc(5) and alpm-db-files(5)) and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;those in an alpm-package(7) (i.e. ALPM-MTREE(5), BUILDINFO(5) and PKGINFO(5)).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alpm-srcinfo crate provides a library and command line interface for the parsing, validation and creation of SRCINFO(5) files from PKGBUILD(5) scripts. Due to the dynamic nature of the PKGBUILD(5) scripts, the SRCINFO(5) format is surprisingly complex (both to create and to evaluate). The creation of SRCINFO(5) files from PKGBUILD(5) scripts is enabled via the alpm-pkgbuild-bridge project, the alpm-pkgbuild crate and a translation layer in alpm-srcinfo. We have created dedicated documentation for the aspects of parsing and providing its data from different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alpm-buildinfo crate provides a library and command line interface for the parsing, validation and creation of BUILDINFO(5) files. This file format is contained in an alpm-package(7) and describes its build environment. In the context of reproducible builds it is used to recreate the build environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alpm-mtree crate provides a library and command line interface that allows parsing, validation and creation of ALPM-MTREE(5) files. This file format is a subset of the mtree(5) file format, provided by libarchive. As it can be considered more of a meta language than a data format, we rely on &lt;code&gt;bsdtar(1)&lt;/code&gt; to write that file format.
An ALPM-MTREE(5) file is contained in an alpm-package(7), as well as an entry of an alpm-db(7) and represents a record of all files contained in the package during package creation time.
After installing a package to a system, this file can be used to verify ownership and mode of files installed by the package and detect any missing files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alpm-pkginfo crate offers a library and command line interface for the parsing, validation and creation of PKGINFO(5) files. This file format is contained in an alpm-package(7) and describes all relevant metadata of a package (e.g. alpm-package-relation(7), alpm-package-name(7), alpm-package-version(7)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each system based on alpm(7) maintains its state using an alpm-db(7). This state encompasses information on each package:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the contained files (see alpm-db-files(5))&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;general metadata (see alpm-db-desc(5))&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a record that can be used to validate files of a package (see ALPM-MTREE(5))&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the alpm-db crate, it is possible to parse, validate and create the alpm-db-desc(5) and alpm-db-files(5) file formats. Additionally, we have worked on database access for the alpm-db(7) structure following the ACID characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Packages for compiled languages (e.g. C or C++) usually contain files in the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF). These files may expose soname information which may be used as alpm-package-relation(7) (see alpm-sonamev1(7) and alpm-sonamev2(7) for the two currently understood formats). With the alpm-soname crate we have focused on the handling and extraction of information for the more modern alpm-sonamev2(7) format as well as plain soname information. As a library and CLI, this crate offers easy access to this ELF data, which plays an important role in figuring out the run-time dependencies of packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each alpm-repo(7) contains a set of alpm-package(7) files, digital signatures and a package repository database (see alpm-repo-db(7)). An alpm-repo-db(7) tracks information on particular, unique packages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the contained files (see alpm-repo-files(5))&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;general metadata (see alpm-repo-desc(5))&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the alpm-repo-db crate, it is possible to parse, validate and write alpm-repo-desc(5) and alpm-repo-files(5) files. This crate provides both a library and CLI tool. In the future, it will be extended to allow the creation, reading and writing of alpm-repo-db(7) files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Development integration 👷&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test integration of our libraries against real world data, we have created the dev-scripts crate. It lives in the context of the ALPM project, and is intended as development testbed for assumptions of the various libraries. As such, the crate does not get any releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test integration makes it easy to download and prepare live data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;package source repositories (official and all of the AUR)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;official binary package repositories&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, it is possible to verify&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SRCINFO(5) files in package source repositories of the official repositories and all of the AUR&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ALPM-MTREE(5), BUILDINFO(5) and PKGINFO(5) files in binary packages in the official repositories&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the OpenPGP signatures of all packages in the official repositories&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;alpm-db-desc(5) and alpm-db-files(5) files in the entries of a local alpm-db&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;alpm-repo-desc(5) and alpm-repo-files(5) files in the entries of the alpm-repo-db(7) files of the official repositories&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Python bindings 🐍&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make our modern Rust-based parsers and verified types available for use from in other languages used by the distribution, we provide Python bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arch Linux's largest Python-based project, with arguably also the largest user-base, is the AURweb, which powers the Arch User Repository (AUR). The web application deals with user input, e.g. via SRCINFO(5) files and currently relies on the native Python library python-srcinfo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(As a sidenote: If you are a Python developer and interested in helping maintain a FastAPI based web application, please reach out to the project! We are always looking for further contributors and maintainers!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Python bindings for the ALPM project are available on PyPI as python-alpm. With them, we have focused on providing SRCINFO(5) support by relying on the alpm-srcinfo library and by proxy expose a lot of types from the alpm-types library as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The integration of the python-alpm library into the AURweb application is currently prepared (see aurweb!876).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are a Python developer and have specific needs for the integration of other libraries of the ALPM project, we would love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linting 🧶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linters are tools that shift some tedious responsibilities (e.g. quality control) from humans to automation. They are used to automatically detect common mistakes and deviations from established best practices. The goal of linting is to support humans in performing a task well, keeping them on a level with changes in best practices, and empowering them to produce better quality results with less manual effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usability and robustness of a distribution like Arch Linux currently relies heavily on the diligence of its package maintainers. Only if package maintainers make an effort to stay up to date with recent developments in packaging (e.g. best practices for languages or PKGBUILD(5) scripts) can the resulting package files maintain a high quality standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relying on the written specifications, foundational libraries, as well as libraries and command line interfaces we decided to create a framework for lints, that centrally exposes its knowledge database and allows to flexibly create new rules for various purposes. As such, another central goal of this framework is to provide a single, central tool that covers all aspects of Arch Linux package management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the alpm-lint crate, a central library and command line interface has been created, that thoroughly documents its architecture and how to add new lint rules. A custom, central website provides details about all currently existing lints, derived from the code documentation of the lint rules: https://alpm.archlinux.page/lints/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;alpm-lint(1)&lt;/code&gt; CLI, package maintainers are enabled to validate various scopes relevant to packaging (e.g. contents of an alpm-source-repo(7) or an alpm-package(7) file).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crate currently only offers a small set of lints and we encourage interested package maintainers with a background in Rust to write further lints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Translations 🌐&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are targeting the English language as first language for the project, but many people that are exposed to its error handling and command line interfaces are not native English speakers, or do not speak the language at all. While writing libraries and command line interfaces for various purposes in the context of the ALPM project we realized that we needed to improve the translation (aka. internationalization or i18n) story of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some research on current technologies used for software translation, we have settled on the fluent framework and created a convenient integration for our purposes with the custom fluent-i18n crate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interested users can now start translating the project on weblate, following our dedicated contributing guidelines on localizations and translations: https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/alpm/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;VOA 🔏&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arch Linux uses OpenPGP for the verification of its packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current OpenPGP integration hinges on a central GnuPG-based keyring. This solution suffers from several shortcomings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The keyring is context-independent. It is not possible to represent different verification contexts with it, e.g. package repository metadata that is signed with a different set of keys than those used for signing packages, or packages in unofficial repositories are signed by a different set of keys than those used for the official repositories.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The keyring and its behavior is specific to the GnuPG tool, and in part unspecified. The setup cannot be reliably used with other OpenPGP implementations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The keyring is stateful, and while its contents are populated by data from the package for archlinux-keyring, the entire mechanism requires a root-run agent service.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The GnuPG upstream has denounced the IETF-driven OpenPGP standardization process and has subsequently been removed from other major package management software such as &lt;code&gt;apt(8)&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;rpm(8)&lt;/code&gt;over the last three years. Compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations is no longer guaranteed (see e.g. the ArchWiki article on GnuPG for details)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Already before 2024, the idea emerged to verify digital signatures not with a stateful keyring mechanism, but to instead use a stateless directory structure containing verifiers (see keyringctl#3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This idea was discussed with a set of cross-distribution developers during Image-based Linux Summit 2024 and extended from the initial idea of a lookup directory only for OpenPGP to a more general, technology-agnostic mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, we set out to create a directory structure containing e.g. OpenPGP certificates, SSH pubkeys or X.509 certificates, which clearly describes in what context such verifiers are used when verifying artifacts of a distribution. A more in-depth discussion and rundown of the topic can be found in the talk "Verification of OS artifacts without stateful keyrings" from All Systems Go! 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;UAPI specification ✍️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2024 we started work on a specification to describe this new, technology-agnostic signature verification mechanism and to collect input from relevant stakeholders in several of the more complex technologies that we wanted to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial version of the specification "File Hierarchy for the Verification of OS Artifacts (VOA)" has been made available in June 2025 and covers the integration of OpenPGP as a first technology backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further technology backend specifications are available as drafts, but need more work to iron out open questions. If you have expertise with the use of SSH, X.509, minisign or signify for the signing of artifacts and have an interest in working on a Rust codebase, please reach out and help stabilize these additional backends!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;VOA reference implementation ⌨️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In July 2025 we started work on the VOA project, as a reference implementation of the UAPI specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Central handling of the VOA hierarchy is implemented in the technology-independent voa-core library. It serves as an abstraction to access verifiers from the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of OpenPGP-specific verifiers has been implemented in the voa-openpgp library. It handles artifact verification based on several different methods:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"plain": Artifacts are verified directly with artifact verifiers, without additional trust anchors. Artifact verifiers can be filtered using OpenPGP fingerprints or domain name matches for OpenPGP User IDs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;simple "trust anchor": Artifacts are verified using artifact verifiers, which in turn must be certified by trust anchors. Artifact verifiers can be filtered using domain name matches for OpenPGP User IDs and trust anchors can be filtered using OpenPGP fingerprints. Additionally, the number of required individual certifications for User IDs on each artifact verifier can be specified.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Web of Trust": Artifacts are verified using artifact verifiers, which must reach a sufficient level of trust according to an OpenPGP "Web of Trust" implementation. Artifact verifiers can be filtered using domain name matches for OpenPGP User IDs and trust anchors can be filtered using OpenPGP fingerprints. Additionally, the target trust amount, the trust amount of trusted introducers and the trust amount of filtered trust anchors can be set to a custom value.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orthogonal to the trust models outlined above, it is possible to specify the required number of independent and valid OpenPGP data signatures per artifact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Arch Linux we are currently using the Web of Trust implementation that GnuPG offers, on the basis of a GnuPG-specific keyring. However, for all intents and purposes, we are not making use of the features that the full "Web of Trust" model provides. Apart from basic temporal OpenPGP semantics and cryptographic validity, the following rules apply in archlinux-keyring:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is a set of three or more certificates that serve as trust anchors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is a set of packager certificates that each must have an OpenPGP User ID with an email that uses the "archlinux.org" domain and has three or more third-party certifications from trust anchors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in practice, Arch Linux relies on a "Web of Trust" with exactly one level of indirection, and manually curated sets of trust anchors and artifact verifiers. With voa-openpgp, Arch's verification requirements are best modeled with the simple “trust anchor” model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an additional feature, we have implemented the import of OpenPGP certificates as verifiers into VOA hierarchies from different sources. The import supports OpenPGP certificates split into OpenPGP packets and the custom directory structure used by archlinux-keyring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the voa-config library we have added support for a central configuration file format with which settings for VOA technology backends can be supplied. The file format (see voa(5)) allows flexible overrides that specify custom rules for any type of context in an OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following configuration describes the current policy for the Arch Linux distribution (see arch.yaml):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;default_technology_settings:

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;VOA high-level API and CLI 🖥️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the voa crate we provide a high-level API for consumers of VOA and a command line interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;voa(1)&lt;/code&gt;, it is possible to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inspect technology backend configuration settings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Import OpenPGP certificates as VOA verifiers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;List all VOA verifiers (by OS or specific context).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify a file using a detached OpenPGP signature and suitable VOA verifiers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All subcommands support JSON output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following example illustrates the semantics of the default VOA technology backend settings for Arch Linux as shown in the previous section:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ voa config show arch
OpenPGP settings

🔏 Each artifact requires 1 valid data signature(s) from artifact verifiers to be successfully verified.

✅ Each artifact is verified using the "trust anchor" verification method.

📧 A valid certificate must have a valid User ID that uses one of the following domains and has 3 certification(s) from individual trust anchors on it for the certificate to be considered as artifact verifier:
⤷ archlinux.org

🐾 A valid certificate must match one of the following OpenPGP fingerprints to be considered as trust anchor:
⤷ 2ac0a42efb0b5cbc7a0402ed4dc95b6d7be9892e

📝 The following sources have been considered for the creation of the settings:
⤷ Config file: /usr/share/voa/arch.yaml
⤷ Built-in defaults
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After installing the voa-verifiers-arch package, which provides the VOA verifiers used by Arch Linux, it is possible to verify Arch Linux artifacts (e.g. package files) using &lt;code&gt;voa(1)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ voa verify arch package default openpgp /var/cache/pacman/pkg/shadow-4.18.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst{,.sig}
✅ /var/cache/pacman/pkg/shadow-4.18.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst.sig 1751009927 991f6e3f0765cf6295888586139b09da5bf0d338 62cc73f884e52957b2fdd8839b7a287d9a2ec608
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Web of Trust and the Berblom algorithm 🕸️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The generalized "Web of Trust" model remains an interesting option in the OpenPGP domain. The "Web of Trust" enables more complex and more nuanced setups than the basic "trust anchor" mode. It also allows for fully decentralized management of trust, without relying on any single authority.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of 2024 and 2025, research has gone into comparing different "Web of Trust" implementations (see wot-observatory). The existing (legacy) implementations have surprising limitations and/or defects when it comes to the calculation of trust. This research led us to the conclusion that instead of relying on existing implementations and designs, a new approach was warranted to overcome the limitations of existing "Web of Trust" subsystems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our design is highly modular and centers around a pathfinding algorithm named "Berblom". Berblom is a novel and well-documented approach, which serves as a robust, general and efficient way of calculating the trust amount for an artifact verifier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are excited to integrate Berblom into the VOA reference implementation in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future work 🚀&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the ALPM project succeeded in the goals it set for itself in the funding period with Sovereign Tech Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While a lot of foundational documentation and central libraries have been written, there is still more work ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More lints 🧶🧶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new lint framework provided by alpm-lint currently only features few lints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going forward, we want to extend this list in the dedicated "Lints" milestone and encourage anyone with Rust experience and an interest in packaging to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to implementing lint rules, we want to explore the inclusion of the &lt;code&gt;alpm-lint(1)&lt;/code&gt; CLI in the canonical package build tooling for Arch Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;C-API 🇨&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our original project plan included potentially emulating the libalpm C-API in the scope of the contracting work. However, during the last months we realized, that for many consumers it would be more useful to rely on the finer grained libraries of the ALPM project directly instead. In addition, not all relevant database handling features are fully implemented yet, which would limit the usefulness of a C wrapper library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the medium term, it is certainly possible for interested developers to create an emulation of the libalpm C library based on ALPM. Reach out in case you are interested in something like this!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Repository database handling 📦️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the alpm-repo-db crate we have added support for the data files in use in an alpm-repo-db(7).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going forward, we want to add full handling of the database format: Creation, reading and compression of alpm-repo-db(7) files and the addition, update and removal of entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Add libkrun support to rootless-run 🏃➡️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code&gt;fakeroot(1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rootlesskit&lt;/code&gt; have their place in certain contexts, but they each also have their weaknesses (e.g. &lt;code&gt;fakeroot(1)&lt;/code&gt; does not provide isolation, &lt;code&gt;rootlesskit&lt;/code&gt; does not work in a containerized context).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going forward, we want to explore adding libkrun support to rootless-run to accommodate stronger isolation on the basis of KVM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Downloading of artifacts ⏬️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alpm-package and alpm-repo-db crates provide integration for handling local package and repository database files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a package management workflow these are usually downloaded from an alpm-repo(7). We want to provide support for securely downloading these artifacts over the network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Verification of artifacts 🔏&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VOA provides a distribution- and technology-agnostic specification for artifact verification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the voa project reference implementation, we want to add OpenPGP based verification for alpm-package(7) and alpm-repo-db(7) files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More VOA technology backends 🔐&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the technology backend for OpenPGP in place, we have ironed out the generic handling of verifiers in the voa reference implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interested parties have already worked on a proof of concept for an x.509 technology backend and provided a ticket for the inclusion of signify as technology backend (see voa#24).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in helping with the specification and implementation of more technology backends, please reach out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Extend Python bindings 🐍🐍&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are very happy with the current feature set of python-alpm. Going forward, we want to extend the API for the Python bindings further to cover even more use-cases of interested projects, such as archinstall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you enjoy hacking on the intersection of Rust and Python, feel free to reach out! We would be excited to collaborate with any interested contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More applications ⌨️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new set of ALPM project libraries enables building robust tools. Users of the libraries can rely on a strongly typed, memory safe language 🦀&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This empowers developers to build new special purpose package management applications with much greater ease. We look forward to building such applications ourselves, as well as seeing other parties building them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, user-facing improvements are our goal, and we think the foundation that we laid over the past year is fertile ground for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;demo-trimmed.mp4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lightweight 2D video seek grid library for video streaming sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate videos visually with a thumbnail grid instead of a 1D seek bar. Client-side frame extraction with smooth marker animation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;🎯 Stop blind scrubbing. See every scene at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Traditional Seek Bar&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;VAM Seek&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1D timeline, trial-and-error&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2D grid, instant visual navigation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Server-generated thumbnails&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Client-side canvas extraction&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Heavy infrastructure&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zero server load, ~15KB JS&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complex integration&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;One-line setup&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- 1. Add the script --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/unhaya/vam-seek/dist/vam-seek.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- 2. Connect to your video --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
  VAMSeek.init({
    video: document.getElementById('myVideo'),
    container: document.getElementById('seekGrid'),
    columns: 5,
    secondsPerCell: 15
  });
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it. See docs/INTEGRATION.md for full documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Client-side frame extraction - No server CPU usage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LRU cache - 200 frames cached in memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smooth marker animation - 60fps with requestAnimationFrame&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VAM algorithm - Precise timestamp calculation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Framework support - React, Vue, vanilla JS examples included&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your video never leaves the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional thumbnail systems upload videos to a server, process with FFmpeg, store thumbnails, and serve via CDN. This costs money, takes time, and raises privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VAM Seek works differently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Traditional&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;VAM Seek&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Video uploaded to server&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Video stays in browser&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Server-side FFmpeg processing&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Client-side Canvas API&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Thumbnails stored on disk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Frames cached in memory&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CDN bandwidth costs&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zero server cost&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Privacy risk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fully private&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All frame extraction happens in the user's browser using the Canvas API. When the page closes, everything is gone. No data is ever sent to any server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long videos are no longer watched from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We search. We go back. We verify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UI for this just didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;80-90%: Passive watching (1D seek bar is perfect)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10-20%: "Where was that scene?" / "I want to see that again" / "Skip this part"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1D seek bar excels at passive viewing. But for active exploration, it fails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Principle&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Implementation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Don't replace, supplement&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1D stays for normal use, 2D appears when needed&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zero learning curve&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;One click to show, click thumbnail to jump&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zero cognitive load&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"Let me check" → Already visible&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Disappears when not needed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Closes naturally, no mode switching&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1D seek bar is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lightweight&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Universally understood&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized for touch/mouse&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perfect for passive viewing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2D doesn't replace 1D. It handles what 1D cannot: exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good UI has these properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Doesn't break existing workflows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Appears only when needed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Understood instantly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Missed when removed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VAM Seek satisfies all four. Once you use it, going back feels incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: This UI is based on a design concept I call "Grid Seek Marker" — a time-exploration interface where video becomes a 2D navigable space. VAM Seek is the implementation; Grid Seek Marker is the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
