    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Guix System First Impressions as a Nix User&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. My Journey to Guix System&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feel free to skip this section if you don't really care about backstories. I just figured it makes sense to recap how and why one might start having an interest in declarative distros before tackling the main topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been a Linux-only1 user for about ten years now and, like many others, I too embarked on the arduous journey of distro-hopping. I started with Mint and when that felt too slow, I switched to Ubuntu. When Ubuntu felt too handholdy2, I switched to Arch, which proved to be my main driver for well over five or so years. And when I couldn't resist the Siren's call, I moved on to Gentoo, thinking surely "harder is better". Which resulted in severe burnout in a few months, so I capitulated and switched to Fedora, which was very stable and honestly an all around excellent system. But once more, my interest was piqued, and (before today's adventure) I finally switched to NixOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've always had a passing interest towards Nix ever since I've first heard about it, but until fairly recently, I always dismissed it as a tool for DevOps guys. The syntax was weird, the need for reproducible environments seemingly irrelevant, and stuff like the oft-recommended Nix Pills seemed anything but newbie-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So then why would someone like me, who's so adamant about not needing Nix eventually choose to go all-in? I guess it was at first less about Nix being better and just the rest being worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Of the two big reasons for the switch, one was that I realized that having per-directory environments for your projects is actually a very handy thing to do when you like to toy around with many technologies. I used to generate my other blog using Jekyll and, no matter which distro I used, it was always a pain in the neck to have a good Ruby environment set up. &lt;code&gt;bundler install&lt;/code&gt; didn't really want to work without privileges and I wasn't really a fan of unleashing &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; on it, but usually that was the only way I could get things to work.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; With Nix, however, it was a matter of just describing a few packages in a shell and boom, Ruby in one folder, no Ruby (and thus no mess) everywhere else. I was hooked! I started adding &lt;code&gt;shell.nix&lt;/code&gt; files to all my little projects, hell, I started planning projects by first adding a &lt;code&gt;shell.nix&lt;/code&gt; with all the dependencies I would reasonably need.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other reason, which ultimately cemented that I need to commit, was that I was getting tired of my installed packages slowly drifting out of control. Sure, every package manager has some method of listing what's installed, but these are usually cumbersome and completely ephemeral (in the sense that any listing becomes invalid the moment you change anything).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With NixOS, the equation is flipped on its head: No longer did I query the system to tell me what's installed and what's not, it was now the system that worked based on files that I edit. The difference sounds small on paper, but for me it was an extremely liberating feeling to know that I could edit my system configuration in a versionable, explicit, and centralized way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But NixOS isn't the only declarative distro out there. In fact GNU forked Nix fairly early and made their own spin called Guix, whose big innovation is that, instead of using the unwieldy Nix-language, it uses Scheme. Specifically Guile Scheme, GNU's sanctioned configuration language. I've been following Guix for a bit, but it never felt quite ready to me with stuff like KDE being only barely supported and a lot of hardware not working out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, now that (after three years) Guix announced its 1.5.0 release with a lot of stuff stabilized and KDE finally a first-party citizen, I figured now is the best time to give it a fresh shot. This post captures my experiences from installation to the first 3-4 days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Installer Impressions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Plug your USB in, &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; the file onto the drive, reboot, nothing unusual. If you've ever installed a Linux system, it's more of the same.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After selecting the pendrive in my BIOS settings, the monitor began to glow in a deep, radiant blue as the Guix System logo appeared on my screen… only to suddenly switch to a menacing red: My CPU's integrated GPU is not supported by free firmware. A helpful popup gave me a gentle nudge about picking free hardware next time (buddy, have you seen the PC part prices these days?) and off I went into the installer proper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 1: Picture of the installer graciously borrowed from the Guix installer manual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The installer itself is refreshingly barebones and I mean this in a positive way. It asks all the necessary questions and provides a nice basic configuration file, all done in a retro Ncurses-based TUI. I was really happy to see that, unlike my last attempt at using Guix System in the early 2020-s, KDE Plasma is now a first-party choice during installation. I never really vibed too much with GNOME and the other options didn't appeal either, so the choice was obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I'm not sure if I just picked the worst possible time or if the Guix servers were facing unusual load or whatever may have happened, but after such a breeze of a setup, the moment I pressed install, my PC became unusable for the next 2.5 hours. Which is unacceptable for an installation process these days in my opinion. I am lucky enough to live in a household with fiber-optic internet, that merely shrugs at bandwidth of up to a gigabyte per second and yet nearly all packages downloaded with a whopping 50 kilobytes per second, meaning even small-ish 5-10 megabyte packages took long minutes to download.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reboot later my issues only got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. I Can't Find my Way-land&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was assuming I'd get SDDM after having chosen KDE Plasma, but (what a later, closer read of the manual made me realize is the expected outcome for a default config) it was GDM that loaded in. I entered my name and password, and I was greeted with the familiar Plasma 6 spinner. The first hint that something might be off was that it loaded a bit longer than usual, but I was not going to get mad at waiting 10 seconds instead of 3. After all, I did just wait magnitudes longer to get here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With practically nothing installed beyond the very basics, I clicked on Konsole, hoping to start prodding around my config and add some of my day to day apps. To my horror, it opened in the top left corner, without a titlebar and without any borders. What's more, no matter what I did, I couldn't move it. It also didn't show up on the menu bar, despite the application launcher still being completely usable. At this point I was fairly exhausted by these antics, but I figured,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Well, it's a brand new release, perhaps this just snuck in. Let's give updating a shot and see if that helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; So I issued &lt;code&gt;guix pull&lt;/code&gt;… The download whizzed by with speed quite unexpected after what I experienced with the installer… Only to crash into the brick wall that's indexing. Okay, whatever, another 10-12 minutes down the drain, at least now I have newest version.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 2: Better than before download speeds&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Except I didn't. Because, unlike Nix, the &lt;code&gt;guix&lt;/code&gt; executable is not an omnipresent, unique thing that anyone and everyone uses on your PC. Not only does every user have their own instance, if you don't issue a certain set of commands, you won't start using the new version, despite updating it.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To Guix's credit, the CLI does scream at you to update your environment or else you'll keep using the old version, but I still find this system very disorientating compared to Nix. I'm certain experienced Guixheads are long past being tripped up by this sort of stuff and might even struggle to remember that there was a time they had to do these special steps too, but as a new user it felt a bit rough, especially consdering this is Guix System, i.e. the system whose whole purpose is to be integrate Guix as much as it can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Back to our issue at hand. I issued &lt;code&gt;sudo -s&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;guix pull&lt;/code&gt;-ed again. Once more 10-12 minutes passed indexing. But at least I could finally call &lt;code&gt;guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm&lt;/code&gt;. Interestingly things are much faster this time around, I saw speeds up to 30-50 Mbps. Before long the system was updated to the newest commit and I rebooted with high hopes.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High hopes, that were immediately dashed when Plasma loaded in the same messed up way. At this point I started to suspect this might be an issue with the GPU driver, so I enabled the LXQT desktop environment and rebooted once more. Thankfully that one worked like a charm and I was able to boot up both Emacs (editing Scheme with GNU Nano is a pain I do not wish on anyone) and LibreWolf (Firefox's de-Mozilla-d variant).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Not having found anything too useful in the docs, I decided to make my problem someone else's so I fired up ERC4 and connected to Libera.chat's &lt;code&gt;#guix&lt;/code&gt; channel. After around half an hour of wait, a user by the name of Rutherther stepped up and offered me some help. We were able to figure it out that Nouveau wasn't able to drive my GPU (an RTX 5070), so his recommendation was that I should try booting with &lt;code&gt;nomodeset&lt;/code&gt;. I did, but it sadly didn't help much either.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Sympathy for the Devil&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I was out of ideas. Ideas of solving this using pure-Guix System, that is. There was still one option I wanted to avoid as long as I could, but alas, it seemed like the only option, that still had a realistic chance of working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 3: Nonguix's official logo, self-described to be "dark and evil".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter Nonguix, the Mr. Hyde to Guix's Dr. Jekyll, the shady guy who offers you a hit and first time's for free, the… Erm, in a nutshell, it's the repository for non-free applications and drivers packages for Guix System, basically. Interestingly enough, by Guix's own findings about 64% of users utilize the Nonguix channel, which is perhaps not "literally everyone", but it does paint a picture that there is still stuff out there that you simply cannot replace with FOSS software yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;1: (cons* (channel 2: (name 'nonguix) 3: (url "https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix") 4: ;; Enable signature verification: 5: (introduction 6: (make-channel-introduction 7: "897c1a470da759236cc11798f4e0a5f7d4d59fbc" 8: (openpgp-fingerprint 9: "2A39 3FFF 68F4 EF7A 3D29 12AF 6F51 20A0 22FB B2D5")))) 10: %default-channels)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Enabling the repo wasn't exactly difficult. You just paste the short excerpt from above (also found in the README) into your &lt;code&gt;~/.config/guix/channels.scm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc/guix/channels.scm&lt;/code&gt; files, &lt;code&gt;guix pull&lt;/code&gt;, let it index to its heart's content again, and then you have access to all that is nasty (yet occasionally useful) in the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured perhaps if Linux-libre and its free firmware couldn't deal with my GPU, then surely Linux proper with its binary blobs could. Hell, for good measure I threw in the NVIDIA transform, which is supposed to automagically translate all dependencies to use the proprietary drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 4: What haste and half-reading manuals gets you…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out my eagerness was a mistake. Not only did the process take yet another half an hour (if not more, I stopped counting), upon reboot all I was met with was a kernel panic about the driver not being able to cope with the GPU it found and a massive spew of FSCK logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 5: 'FSCK' was indeed very close to the first words that came to my mind at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With no better ideas in mind, I took out my pendrive again and burned Nonguix's own pre-built ISO on it using my partner's PC. While it ultimately did get me a working system, this version has three unfortunate hindrances:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It was built in 2022, far before Guix's migration to Codeberg, meaning it still attempts to pull content from the unfathomably slow GNU Savannah mirror. I had to manually override my &lt;code&gt;channels.scm&lt;/code&gt;to point at the Codeberg repo instead, but with no easy means of finding its "channel introduction"5, I had to pass in&lt;code&gt;--disable-authentication&lt;/code&gt;to Guix when updating my system. A bit scary, but I trust the Codeberg repo.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Because of its age, I got a lot of somewhat intimidating errors about hardware not being recognized and other stuff I couldn't even decipher, but ultimately the system booted to the installer without issue.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For some reason while the installer itself does include Nonguix stuff, it actually does not include the repo in the resulting channels files, nor the substitution server for the project. The README has a warning about this, but if you happen to miss it, you could accidentally install a non-Nonguix Guix System (say that three times fast).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; None of these were particularly hard to fix, however, and soon enough I was back where I started. That is to say, in a &lt;code&gt;nomodeset&lt;/code&gt; X11 session, except this time running i3, as LXQT wasn't an available option on an installer this old. There was certainly a bit of a hacker-ish vibe to messing with code files in an environment like that, but I was honestly much more looking forward to finally having a usable desktop.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Having learned from my hastiness, this time I was smarter. I only enabled the full kernel and firmware blobs, without going anywhere near the NVIDIA transform. I issued another &lt;code&gt;guix system reconfigure&lt;/code&gt; and, after having time for another tea session, my update was finally finished.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I rebooted with tentative nervousness and… Success? Huh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Goals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously there is little point in throwing Guix System on my PC and declaring success. I wanted to be able to at least reproduce the kind of workflow I'm used to using NixOS. For that, I need the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A browser: preferably Firefox, as I'm not a huge fan of Chrome / Chromium,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An E-mail client: preferably Thunderbird,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A basic office suite: preferably LibreOffice,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dev environments: for Rust, Zig, Scheme, and TypeScript (with the option for more, if possible),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Emacs: I do almost all my text editing in it these days, falling back to Neovim for quick tasks,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discord: for chatting with friends,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Telegram: for chatting with family,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Steam: for the very rare occasions I want to game,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NVIDIA drivers: I prefer to offload day-to-day usage to my CPU's integrated GPU, as it cuts my energy usage in half.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of these it was obvious that two would be relatively hard and one "outright impossible". The two being Steam and the drivers (as both are non-free and thus not in Guix's default repos) and the "impossible" one being Discord (which not even the non-free repo has packaged). But I was ready to compromise a little bit since I am requesting stuff that's explicitly against Guix's goals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;6. Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 6: My desktop running Wezterm packaged by me and Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While there has been occasional bumps and hitches along the ride, I must say I'm very impressed with Guix System so far. Let's go through this list in order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browser: So far I'm really enjoying LibreWolf. It feels a lot snappier than Firefox and I'm really baffled how much speed I was apparently missing out on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;E-mails: I installed Icedove, which is basically just Thunderbird without Mozilla branding. It works as expected.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Office suite: LibreOffice is available as expected. Not much to say about it. I guess it's interesting that Guix isn't following the usual &lt;code&gt;-stale&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-fresh&lt;/code&gt;packaging schema, but I don't really mind not having cutting edge versions of an office suite :)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dev environments: I've only briefly toyed with development environments so far, but to me it seems like for simple use-cases it might be even easier to use than &lt;code&gt;shell.nix&lt;/code&gt;(you don't need any sort of ceremony, just a&lt;code&gt;manifest.scm&lt;/code&gt;file with a&lt;code&gt;(specifications-&amp;gt;manifest &amp;lt;list of packages&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt;form inside and you have a dev env ready to go.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Emacs: Installed just fine. I had to install &lt;code&gt;emacs-vterm&lt;/code&gt;to make Vterm work, but all that took was the very simple process of adding the library to my home configuration and then referencing it in my Emacs config as per this Reddit post.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discord: I decided to just use Discord's browser version, which works just as fine (if not better). It's trading a tiny bit of convenience in return for not having to figure out how to manually add a package for it from some random third-party source. From what I've read elsewhere Flatpak is also an option, but I prefer having just one package manager at a time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Steam: Installed shockingly easily. I have to really give props to the Nonguix team. I tested Portal 2 with the Nouveau driver, it is a little disheartening to see a 15 years old game6 lag, but I understand the people's hands are tied when it comes to the free drivers. After I managed to install the proprietary drivers, I was able to play even Portal RTX, which is something I never managed to get to work using NixOS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NVIDIA drivers: This time I actually read the docs properly and it didn't take long for me to realize the initial problem that caused my previous install to be unbootable was of course found between the chair and keyboard. This time, after making sure I enabled the open drivers and kernel mode-setting, I crossed my fingers, issued a reconfigure and it works beautifully!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6.1. The Good&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helpful community: While I do feel like Guix's community could be much larger (see below), the one that exists is very helpful and nice from my limited experience. In all places I've looked so far (Libera's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#guix&lt;/code&gt;, /r/Guix, and the guix/guix Codeberg repository) I was met with genuinely kind and helpful people.&lt;p&gt;That is not to say I haven't seen some bad eggs, especially in posts from years ago, but I don't think there is any community without those, so I'm not going to cite this as a negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Home configuration: Having &lt;code&gt;guix home&lt;/code&gt;be a built-in, first class citizen, instead of a community made "extension" is excellent. Instead of needing to consult a third-party resource like Home Manager's documentation you can simply use what you already know about Guix and, if you happen to hit a wall, you can just read the official handbook which is guaranteed to always stay up to date with the rest of the system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Package availability: As long as you largely use FOSS stuff (which is much easier than one might think), the amount of choice is awesome. I could basically just copy over the list of packages from my Nix config and practically everything had an equivalent.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Scheme: I'm not really a seasoned Schemer, but I have dabbled in the language previously and it feels so much better to me than Nix (the language) ever did. One great benefit of this is that it's a lot easier to start digging into package definitions to figure things out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is "Freedom 1" of GNU's Four Essential Freedoms in effect. Since the code is pretty much just Scheme and the different mechanisms available are fairly well documented (see caveat below), the barrier to entry is much lower than with Nix in my opinion.7&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another nice benefit of this is that you can use Emacs' extensive Scheme support to help your configuration. Tools like Geiser can plug right into Guix and help you find package and function names and, once you're experienced enough, debug your config/packages on the fly. I personally haven't yet achieved mastery of such level yet, but having the REPL confirm if I've entered names in correctly before running the code is already a boon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ease of hacking: In the "to tinker on" sense, rather than "being insecure". With Nix, merely pulling in Nixpkgs is an effort, due to the repository being massive. My otherwise beefy machine struggled to switch between branches and make commits, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence in contributing, even though it was otherwise something I was excited to do. Meanwhile, with Guix I was able to get a fully functioning development environment in 15 minutes tops, which includes cloning the repo, authenticating all commits, generating bytecode for the entire repository, and getting Emacs set up to work nice with the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, at the time of writing my Nixpkgs PR of guile-colorized is still not accepted, despite being open since October, 2025. Which is kind of disheartening, when the package is really trivial and has a very low blast-radius. With Guix I got an answer to an extremely noobish question on my first PR in mere hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a separate, but related note, I also found it a lot easier to test my package in a "live" environment as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;guix pull&lt;/code&gt;supports a parameter called&lt;code&gt;--url&lt;/code&gt;which you can easily point to a folder on your own PC. So once I was confident my code should work, I could just "check out" my local repository clone and build it like I was an end user. This let me make sure it really does work.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6.2. The Ambiguous&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;guix search&lt;/code&gt;not taking an extra parameter like&lt;code&gt;nix search&lt;/code&gt;is both very convenient and a bit of a bummer.&lt;p&gt;Its absence is not a deal breaker, but I really loved how with Nix, you could search in anything, that has a flake. Be that Nixpkgs, a repo you downloaded, a repo that's on a git forge, etc. I remember being awestruck that I could just do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nix search github:mozilla/nixpkgs-mozilla&lt;/code&gt;and search for their builds of Firefox without having to manually check out anything.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The documentation: Oof, this one is a bit hard to pass definite judgment on.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On one hand I love the thoroughness of it all. You can get a fairly decent idea of what Guix, what it can do for your, how to use it, and how to extend it, just by reading the manual. It is evident that the Guix team and GNU in general takes its mission to educate using free software very seriously. Stuff like the Packaging tutorial make it very easy for complete beginners to hack together package definitions without needing to consult any other resource.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it really is just a manual, not a tutorial. What I mean by this is that concepts that could belong together aren't placed near each other. A simple example would be services and customizing them. Assuming, you're in one of the sub-pages of Services and you suddenly realize you want to replace/modify one of the services, you are left completely clueless how that works. You have to go to a completely different chapter and find one particular function's description and then apply what you learn there. The Guix Cookbook has some examples, but you have to know about the cookbook in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And before anyone misunderstands me, I'm fine with RTFM, but in my opinion one of the preconditions of mass-appeal is having "pre-chewed" solutions for common problems, that don't require perusing multiple chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6.3. The Bad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Substitute server stability: I imagine this is an issue that only a massive bag of money could fix, but the CI/CD servers could definitely use some more processing power. It's really annoying when you're trying to test something and you're suddenly forced to wait 10-15 minutes because the server can only spare 50-100 kbps for you.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Content out there: Clearly this isn't the Guix team's fault (and it's something I'm trying to lessen with this post, even if just a tiny bit), but it's really hard to find good quality material when it comes to Guix.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I mean, sure, there is the excellent System Crafters tutorial series, and the odd gems like DThompson's dev env tutorial, but as a whole you're largely left to your own to trawl through the manual, IRC logs, Reddit threads, Codeberg and the previous issue tracker, etc. It's not an impossible task, especially if you're used to doing Linux things "the hard way", but it's certainly a far cry from such one-stop shops as the Nix Flakes book or Wombat's Book of Nix.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Guix's own build speed: Nix excels in speed, so I was hoping Guix would be the same. Yet stuff like &lt;code&gt;guix pull&lt;/code&gt;really bog things down. Doubly so, if you want to update not just your own&lt;code&gt;guix&lt;/code&gt;instance, but also root's.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clarity of commands: The fact that all concerns are lumped together (unlike Nix's many utilities) means that to the new user the many commands such as &lt;code&gt;guix pull&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;guix {system, home} reconfigure&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;guix update&lt;/code&gt;can easily feel overwhelming and unclear what's updating/changing what. With time I'm sure you obtain a sort of mental muscle memory and you never think about it again, but starting out it's definitely a confusing part.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;7. Overall&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell I'm very positively surprised by Guix System. After struggling so much with it years ago, this time everything just clicked after a much shorter battle. So much so that I'm happy to make it my daily driver for the foreseeable future. Beyond the slightly slower execution speed, I'm getting a comparable experience to NixOS, with all the usual pros a declarative environment brings and without having to put up with Nixlang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; My only recurring issues so far are the occasional slow download speeds and that I have to start my kernel in &lt;code&gt;nomodeset&lt;/code&gt; because otherwise the graphical environment crashes without me being able to switch to a TTY. It's a bummer, but honestly, I'm not too bothered by it so far. I'm trusting a driver update will fix it soon enough and, if not, it's not exactly difficult to throw in a kernel parameter into your config.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm hoping to do a followup post about packaging in Guix, because I've been dipping my toes into it by trying to package Wezterm and the journey there was similarly arduous as installing the system itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Till then, thank you for reading and see you next time!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;8. Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stuff you see below are all I managed to write down mid-process. Some of these I threw it into the file from Nano, some from half-broken X11 sessions. Because of this, it's not exactly well-edited, but I hope it might provide a glimpse into my mind at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;item&gt;The installer is decently simple&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I appreciate the warning about incompatible hardware&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;2.5 hours at least to install (mirrors throttle connection to 50kbps)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;KDE is simply not working out of the box (titlebars are missing)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It seems to also default to X11, when I'm looking for Wayland&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The first&lt;/item&gt;&lt;code&gt;guix pull&lt;/code&gt;is horrendously slow&lt;item&gt;Wayland continues to elude me, seems to be an Nvidia issue&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;IRC recommends&lt;/item&gt;&lt;code&gt;nomodeset&lt;/code&gt;, doesn't help&lt;item&gt;Try enabling Nonguix, system no longer boots&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Try installing using the Nonguix ISO&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lots of errors, terribly old release&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Having to&lt;/item&gt;&lt;code&gt;guix pull&lt;/code&gt;myself to the present day again&lt;item&gt;Also I'm missing the introduction, so I have to run it using&lt;/item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--disable-authentication&lt;/code&gt;, not great, but I trust the Codeberg repo&lt;item&gt;At least the download speed seems to have normalized&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It isn't entirely clear when you have to use&lt;/item&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;item&gt;Running&lt;/item&gt;&lt;code&gt;i3&lt;/code&gt;on a shitty low-res has a certain vibe to it, but I'd prefer a system working out of the box&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, if only life was so easy. What I mean here is that on my personal computer, I've not had Windows since about 2015. For work purposes my hands are currently chained to MacOS (though even there I use a Debian-based container).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No disrespect to Ubuntu-users, past and present! My opinion at the time was quite ignorant and nowadays I far more appreciate an easy to maintain system as you'll see from the rest of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's merely a hunch, but it feels to me that the servers are far slower during the (Central-European) night. During midday, I get really good download speeds, but after around 8 PM, it slows to a crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which, for the uninitiated, is an IRC client built into Emacs. This editor continues to wow me every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I probably could have figured it out in time. But at this point I was a bit exasperated and I really didn't want to type in an 10x4 character hexadecimal code by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goodness gracious, Portal 2 is almost 15 years old…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, my Nix experience was still very much helpful here. Understanding stuff such as build phases, why packages need to be patched and how this usually works, and what the different build flags mean is pretty much a must if you want to attain an understanding deeper than just "kinda getting it."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ramp for Real Estate&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goldbridge is building the financial operating system for the largest asset class in the world – real estate. More than $1T in rent flows through landlord bank accounts annually, with roughly a quarter locked in idle reserves and security deposits – and billions more leaking from unnecessary property expenses. And with $2.5T in real estate loans about to mature in 2027/28, property owners are desperate to boost their income ASAP. Goldbridge solves this problem by creating the first AI-powered banking platform for real estate owners. We are backed by Y Combinator and other world-class investors, and our CEO is a 2x YC founder, former White House advisor, and 100-unit real estate owner/operator who understands this industry deeply.

    &lt;p&gt;Lunch break at the Finnish International School of Tampere (FISTA) is a boisterous time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The yard is filled with children — ranging from grades 1 to 9, or ages 6 to 16 — running around, shouting, playing football, shooting basketball hoops, doing what kids do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there's not a single screen in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FISTA has taken advantage of the law change, brought in last August, which allows schools to restrict or completely ban the use of mobile phones during school hours. At FISTA, this means no phones at all unless specifically used for learning in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We've seen that cutting down on the possibilities for students to use their phones, during the breaks for instance, has spurred a lot of creativity," FISTA vice principal Antti Koivisto notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"They're more active, doing more physical things like playing games outdoors or taking part in the organised break activities or just socialising with each other."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the smartphone restriction in schools widely considered to have been a success, Finland's government has now set its sights on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Petteri Orpo (NCP) said earlier this month that he supports banning the use of social media by children under the age of 15.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I am deeply concerned about the lack of physical activity among children and young people, and the fact that it is increasing," Orpo said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there is a growing groundswell of support for Finland introducing such a ban. Two-thirds of respondents to a survey published earlier this week said they back a ban on social media for under-15s. This is a near 10 percentage point jump compared to a similar survey carried out just last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;"Uncontrolled human experiment"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concerns over social media, and in particular the effects on children, have been well-documented — but Finnish researcher Silja Kosola's recent description of the phenomenon as an "uncontrolled human experiment" has grabbed people's attention once again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kosola, an associate professor in adolescent medicine, has researched the impact of social media on young people, and tells Yle News that the consequences are not very well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We see a rise in self-harm and especially eating disorders. We see a big separation in the values of young girls and boys, which is also a big problem in society," Kosola explains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the video below, Silja Kosola explains the detrimental effects that excessive use of social media can have on young people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She further notes that certain aspects of Finnish culture — such as the independence and freedom granted to children from a young age — have unwittingly exacerbated the ill effects of social media use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We have given smartphones to younger people more than anywhere else in the world. Just a couple of years ago, about 95 percent of first graders had their own smartphone, and that hasn't happened anywhere else," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;All eyes on Australia&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 10 December last year, children under the age of 16 in Australia have been banned from using social media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began drafting the legislation after he received a heartfelt letter from a grieving mother who lost her 12-year-old daughter to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Albanese has never revealed the details of the letter, he told public broadcaster ABC that it was "obvious social media had played a key role" in the young girl's death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legislation aims to shift the burden away from parents and children and onto the social media companies, who face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (29 million euros) if they consistently fail to keep kids off their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clare Armstrong, ABC's chief digital political correspondent, told Yle News that the initial reaction to the roll-out has been some confusion but no little "relief".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The government often talks about this law as being a tool to help parents and other institutions enforce and start conversations about tech and social media in ways that before, they couldn't," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although it is still early days, as the ban has only been in force for about six weeks, Armstrong adds that the early indicators have been good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ABC journalist Clare Armstrong explains in the video below how children in Australia have been spending their time since the social media ban was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, she adds a note of caution to any countries — such as Finland — looking to emulate the Australian model, noting that communication is key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Because you can write a very good law, but if the public doesn't understand it, and if it can't be enforced at that household level easily, then it's bound to fail," Armstrong says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Playing to Finland's strengths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seona Candy, an Australian living in Helsinki for over eight years, has been keenly following the events in her homeland since the social media ban came into effect in December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She has heard anecdotally that if kids find themselves blocked from one platform, they just set up an account on another, "ones that maybe their parents don't even know exist".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And this is then much, much harder, because those platforms don't have parental controls, so they don't have those things already designed into them that the more mainstream platforms do," Candy says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of this issue, and others she has heard about, she warns against Finland introducing like-for-like legislation based around Australia's "reactive, knee-jerk" law change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I think the Finnish government should really invest in digital education, and digital literacy, and teach kids about digital safety. Finland is world-famous for education, and for media literacy. Play to your strengths, right?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The All Points North podcast asked if Finland should introduce a similar ban on social media as in Australia. You can listen to the episode via this embedded player, on Yle Areena, via Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mobile carriers can get your GPS location&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In iOS 26.3, Apple introduced a new privacy feature which limits “precise location” data made available to cellular networks via cell towers. The feature is only available to devices with Apple’s in-house modem introduced in 2025. The announcement1 says&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cellular networks can determine your location based on which cell towers your device connects to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is well-known. I have served on a jury where the prosecution obtained location data from cell towers. Since cell towers are sparse (especially before 5G), the accuracy is in the range of tens to hundreds of metres2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is not the whole truth, because cellular standards have built-in protocols that make your device silently send GNSS (i.e. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) location to the carrier. This would have the same precision as what you see in your Map apps, in single-digit metres.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2G and 3G this is called Radio Resources LCS Protocol (RRLP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So the network simply asks “tell me your GPS coordinates if you know them” and the phone will respond3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 4G and 5G this is called LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;RRLP, RRC, and LPP are natively control-plane positioning protocols. This means that they are transported in the inner workings of cellular networks and are practically invisible to end users4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that GNSS location is never meant to leave your device. GNSS coordinates are calculated entirely passively, your device doesn’t need to send a single bit of information. Using GNSS is like finding out where you are by reading a road sign: you don’t have to tell anyone else you read a road sign, anyone can read a road sign, and the people who put up road signs don’t know who read which road sign when.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These capabilities are not secrets but somehow they have mostly slid under the radar of the public consciousness. They have been used in the wild for a long time, such as by the DEA in the US in 200656:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[T]he DEA agents procured a court order (but not a search warrant) to obtain GPS coordinates from the courier’s phone via a ping, or signal requesting those coordinates, sent by the phone company to the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And by Shin Bet in Israel, which tracks everyone everywhere all the time7:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The GSS Tool was based on centralized cellular tracking operated by Israel’s General Security Services (GSS). The technology was based on a framework that tracks all the cellular phones running in Israel through the cellular companies’ data centers. According to news sources, it routinely collects information from cellular companies and identifies the location of all phones through cellular antenna triangulation and GPS data7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, the Israeli government started using the data for contact tracing in March 202078, only a few weeks after the first Israeli COVID-19 case. An individual would be sent an SMS message informing them of close contact with a COVID patient and required to quarantine. This is good evidence that the location data Israeli carriers are collecting are far more precise than what cell towers alone can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A major caveat is that I don’t know if RRLP and LPP are the exact techniques, and the only techniques, used by DEA, Shin Bet, and possibly others to collect GNSS data; there could be other protocols or backdoors we’re not privy to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another unknown is whether these protocols can be exploited remotely by a foreign carrier. Saudi Arabia has abused SS7 to spy on people in the US9, but as far as I know this only locates a device to the coverage area of a Mobile Switching Center, which is less precise than cell tower data. Nonetheless, given the abysmal culture, competency, and integrity in the telecom industry, I would not be shocked if it’s possible for a state actor to obtain the precise GNSS coordinates of anyone on earth using a phone number/IMEI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple made a good step in iOS 26.3 to limit at least one vector of mass surveillance, enabled by having full control of the modem silicon and firmware. They must now allow users to disable GNSS location responses to mobile carriers, and notify the user when such attempts are made to their device.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;About Genode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Genode OS Framework is a tool kit for building highly secure special-purpose operating systems. It scales from embedded systems with as little as 4 MB of memory to highly dynamic general-purpose workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Genode is based on a recursive system structure. Each program runs in a dedicated sandbox and gets granted only those access rights and resources that are needed for its specific purpose. Programs can create and manage sub-sandboxes out of their own resources, thereby forming hierarchies where policies can be applied at each level. The framework provides mechanisms to let programs communicate with each other and trade their resources, but only in strictly-defined manners. Thanks to this rigid regime, the attack surface of security-critical functions can be reduced by orders of magnitude compared to contemporary operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The framework aligns the construction principles of L4 with Unix philosophy. In line with Unix philosophy, Genode is a collection of small building blocks, out of which sophisticated systems can be composed. But unlike Unix, those building blocks include not only applications but also all classical OS functionalities including kernels, device drivers, file systems, and protocol stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I built a scriptable 3D game engine for the Nintendo DS so you can write and run games directly on the console itself. Written in C using libnds, it compiles to a ~100KB .nds ROM that runs at 60 FPS. Features a touch-based code editor on the bottom screen and real-time 3D rendering on the top screen. Ships with a working 3D pong game as the default script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt nostalgic for when I made my first games on an old TI-82 graphing calculator. So I tried bringing that whole experience to my Nintendo DS. A complete programming environment you can hold in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you see is a scriptable game engine with a custom programming language featuring variables, loops, and conditionals. You write code using the bottom touchscreen, click play, and the game will execute in real-time on the top screen with full 3D rendering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a high level, the engine breaks down into three parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uses the DS's 3D hardware to render colored cubes at 60 FPS. Each model has position (X, Y, Z), rotation angle, and color. The camera is fully controllable with position and yaw/pitch angles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// DS 3D rendering code (C + libnds) glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); glLoadIdentity(); gluLookAt(camX, camY, camZ, // camera position camX + lookX, camY + lookY, camZ + lookZ, // look target 0, 1, 0); // up vector&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each model is drawn with a transform (position + Y-axis rotation), then the cube geometry: one color, six quads (24 vertices).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Per-model draw calls (from main.c) for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; MAX_MODELS; i++) { if (!modelActive[i]) continue; glPushMatrix(); glTranslatef(modelX[i], modelY[i], modelZ[i]); glRotatef(modelAngle[i], 0, 1, 0); drawCube(CUBE_COLORS[modelColorIndex[i]]); drawWireframeCube(); glPopMatrix(1); } // Cube geometry: RGB15 color -&amp;gt; glColor3b, then 6 faces as GL_QUADS glColor3b(r * 255/31, g * 255/31, b * 255/31); glBegin(GL_QUADS); /* +Z face */ glVertex3f(-1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); glVertex3f( 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); glVertex3f( 1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f); glVertex3f(-1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f); /* -Z, +Y, -Y, +X, -X ... (24 vertices total) */ glEnd();&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A touch-based code editor with a custom UI drawn pixel-by-pixel to a 256x192 bitmap. Features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Software rendering to bottom screen u16 *subBuffer = (u16*)BG_BMP_RAM_SUB(0); // 256x192 framebuffer subBuffer[y * 256 + x] = RGB15(31, 31, 31); // white pixel&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executes one line of script per frame (~60 lines/sec). Scripts can use 26 variables (A-Z) plus 9 read-only registers for input (D-pad, buttons) and system state (elapsed time, camera direction).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Script execution (simplified) if (tokenEquals(script[scriptIP], "add")) { int r = scriptReg[scriptIP]; // which register (A-Z) registers[r] += getNumberParamValue(scriptIP, 0); scriptIP++; // next line }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scripts are built from tokens (commands) with numeric parameters. Each line executes instantly, with no parsing overhead, just a series of if-checks against token names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variables &amp;amp; Math&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET A 5&lt;/code&gt; — set register A to 5&lt;code&gt;ADD A 1&lt;/code&gt; — add 1 to A&lt;code&gt;SUBTRACT A 2&lt;/code&gt; — subtract 2 from A&lt;code&gt;MULTIPLY B -1&lt;/code&gt; — multiply B by -1&lt;p&gt;Control Flow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOOP&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;END_LOOP&lt;/code&gt; — infinite loop&lt;code&gt;IF_GT A 10&lt;/code&gt; — if A &amp;gt; 10&lt;code&gt;IF_LT A 0&lt;/code&gt; — if A &amp;lt; 0&lt;code&gt;IF_TRUE kA&lt;/code&gt; — if A button pressed&lt;code&gt;END_IF&lt;/code&gt; — close conditional&lt;p&gt;3D Objects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MODEL 0&lt;/code&gt; — create model at index 0&lt;code&gt;POSITION 0 X Y Z&lt;/code&gt; — set position&lt;code&gt;ANGLE 0 45&lt;/code&gt; — set rotation angle&lt;code&gt;NEXT_COLOR 0&lt;/code&gt; — cycle color&lt;p&gt;Camera &amp;amp; Rendering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CAM_POS X Y Z&lt;/code&gt; — set camera position&lt;code&gt;CAM_ANGLE yaw pitch&lt;/code&gt; — set look direction&lt;code&gt;BACKGROUND 2&lt;/code&gt; — set bg color (0-3)&lt;code&gt;BEEP&lt;/code&gt; — play 0.1s sound&lt;code&gt;SLEEP 0.016&lt;/code&gt; — pause (60 FPS = 0.016s/frame)&lt;code&gt;LEFT, UP, RGT, DN&lt;/code&gt;: D-pad (1.0 when held, 0.0 when released)
&lt;code&gt;KA, KB&lt;/code&gt;: A and B buttons&lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt;: elapsed seconds since script started&lt;code&gt;LOOKX, LOOKZ&lt;/code&gt;: camera forward direction (normalized X and Z)
&lt;p&gt;The engine ships with a playable pong game. Here's a simplified excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;MODEL 0 ; create ball MODEL 1 ; create paddle CAM_POS 0 8 18 ; position camera SET A 0 ; ball X position SET B 1 ; ball velocity SET C 0 ; paddle Z position LOOP ADD A B ; move ball IF_GT A 10 ; hit right wall? MULTIPLY B -1 ; reverse velocity END_IF IF_TRUE Up ; up button pressed? ADD C -0.5 ; move paddle up END_IF POSITION 0 A 0 0 ; update ball position POSITION 1 -13 0 C ; update paddle position SLEEP 0.016 ; ~60 FPS END_LOOP&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full script includes collision detection, game-over logic, and beep sounds on miss, all done with simple register math and conditionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; in the project directory
&lt;code&gt;program.nds&lt;/code&gt; (~100 KB ROM file)
&lt;p&gt;You need a flashcart (e.g. R4, DSTT, Acekard) with a microSD card:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;program.nds&lt;/code&gt; to the microSD card
&lt;p&gt;Note: I got my R4 cart + SD card from a friend years ago, so I don't have detailed setup instructions for the cart itself. Most modern flashcarts just need you to copy their firmware to the SD root, then add ROMs in a folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can test the DS game engine build directly below. The emulator loads &lt;code&gt;ds-game-engine.nds&lt;/code&gt;. Loads a more basic pong game than the one in the video.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo DS emulator (Desmond). If the game doesn’t start, ensure JavaScript is enabled and the page has finished loading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiled ROM (ds-game-engine.nds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask or discuss in this Reddit thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

└──────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pass security audits and compliance requirements (SOC2, FedRAMP, PCI-DSS)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce attack surface with minimal, distroless images&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get CVE patches within 24-48 hours of disclosure (vs weeks for Debian/Ubuntu)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cryptographically signed images with full SBOM for supply chain security&lt;/item&gt;

While modern architectures like ARM's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) introduce dedicated hardware for matrix operations, existing linear algebra libraries fail to fully exploit its potential, particularly for large matrices. This paper presents MpGEMM, an open-source library that leverages key architectural features of SME to optimize GEMM across multiple precisions. Through a systematic characterization of SME, we derive optimization guidelines that inform our design. MpGEMM employs cache-aware partitioning, efficient data packing with on-the-fly transposition, and specialized micro-kernels that utilize multi-vector loads and all available tile registers. Evaluated on an Apple M4 Pro with real-world workloads from DeepSeek and LLaMA, MpGEMM achieves an average speedup of 1.23x over the vendor-optimized Apple Accelerate library and significantly outperforms other open-source alternatives.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the last few months, I have been developing a new reporting application. Early on, I decided to add a –dry-run option to the run command. This turned out to be quite useful – I have used it many times a day while developing and testing the application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The application will generate a set of reports every weekday. It has a loop that checks periodically if it is time to generate new reports. If so, it will read data from a database, apply some logic to create the reports, zip the reports, upload them to an sftp server, check for error responses on the sftp server, parse the error responses, and send out notification mails. The files (the generated reports, and the downloaded feedback files) are moved to different directories depending on the step in the process. A simple and straightforward application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in the development process, when testing the incomplete application, I remembered that Subversion (the version control system after CVS, before Git) had a –dry-run option. Other linux commands have this option too. If a command is run with the argument –dry-run, the output will print what will happen when the command is run, but no changes will be made. This lets the user see what will happen if the command is run without the –dry-run argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remembered how helpful that was, so I decided to add it to my command as well. When I run the command with –dry-run, it prints out the steps that will be taken in each phase: which reports that will be generated (and which will not be), which files will be zipped and moved, which files will be uploaded to the sftp server, and which files will be downloaded from it (it logs on and lists the files).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking back at the project, I realized that I ended up using the –dry-run option pretty much every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am surprised how useful I found it to be. I often used it as a check before getting started. Since I know –dry-run will not change anything, it is safe to run without thinking. I can immediately see that everything is accessible, that the configuration is correct, and that the state is as expected. It is a quick and easy sanity check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also used it quite a bit when testing the complete system. For example, if I changed a date in the report state file (the date for the last successful report of a given type), I could immediately see from the output whether it would now be generated or not. Without –dry-run, the actual report would also be generated, which takes some time. So I can test the behavior, and receive very quick feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Downside&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The downside is that the dryRun-flag pollutes the code a bit. In all the major phases, I need to check if the flag is set, and only print the action that will be taken, but not actually doing it. However, this doesn’t go very deep. For example, none of the code that actually generates the report needs to check it. I only need to check if that code should be invoked in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The type of application I have been writing is ideal for –dry-run. It is invoked by a command, and it may create some changes, for example generating new reports. More reactive applications (that wait for messages before acting) don’t seem to be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I added –dry-run on a whim early on in the project. I was surprised at how useful I found it to be. Adding it early was also good, since I got the benefit of it while developing more functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The –dry-run flag is not for every situation, but when it fits, it can be quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Autonomous cars, drones cheerfully obey prompt injection by road sign&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI vision systems can be very literal readers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indirect prompt injection occurs when a bot takes input data and interprets it as a command. We've seen this problem numerous times when AI bots were fed prompts via web pages or PDFs they read. Now, academics have shown that self-driving cars and autonomous drones will follow illicit instructions that have been written onto road signs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a new class of attack on AI systems, troublemakers can carry out these environmental indirect prompt injection attacks to hijack decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Potential consequences include self-driving cars proceeding through crosswalks, even if a person was crossing, or tricking drones that are programmed to follow police cars into following a different vehicle entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Johns Hopkins showed that, in simulated trials, AI systems and the large vision language models (LVLMs) underpinning them would reliably follow instructions if displayed on signs held up in their camera's view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They used AI to tweak the commands displayed on the signs, such as "proceed" and "turn left," to maximize the probability of the AI system registering it as a command, and achieved success in multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commands in Chinese, English, Spanish, and Spanglish (a mix of Spanish and English words) all seemed to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as tweaking the prompt itself, the researchers used AI to change how the text appeared – fonts, colors, and placement of the signs were all manipulated for maximum efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team behind it named their methods CHAI, an acronym for "command hijacking against embodied AI."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While developing CHAI, they found that the prompt itself had the biggest impact on success, but the way in which it appeared on the sign could also make or break an attack, although it is not clear why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Test results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers tested the idea of manipulating AI thinking using signs in both virtual and physical scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, it would be irresponsible to see if a self-driving car would run someone over in the real world, so these tests were carried out in simulated environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They tested two LVLMs, the closed GPT-4o and open InternVL, each running context-specific datasets for different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Images supplied by the researchers show the changes made to a sign's appearance to maximize the chances of hijacking a car's decision-making, powered by the DriveLM dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking left to right, the first two failed, but the car obeyed the third.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From there, the team tested signs in different languages, and those with green backgrounds and yellow text were followed in each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without the signs placed in the LVLMs' view, the decision was correctly made to slow down as the car approached a stop signal. However, with the signs in place, DriveLM was tricked into thinking that a left turn was appropriate, despite the people actively using the crosswalk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team achieved an 81.8 percent success rate when testing these real-world prompt injections with self-driving cars, but the most reliable tests involved drones tracking objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tests challenged the drone's LVLM, CloudTrack, and its ability to discern real police cars from generic vehicles. In a real-world scenario, this can be useful in cases where a police force needs to deploy a drone to locate a missing patrol car, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers presented CloudTrack with two visuals. The first was a top-down view of two cars driving in parallel. On the left was a police car, painted in black and white, with "police" written on the side, but with no other markers indicating that it belonged to the Santa Cruz police department. On the right was a gray unmarked car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, CloudTrack correctly discerned the police car from the generic car, noting that despite clearly being a police car, there were indeed no markings that suggested it belonged to Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When presented with an identical visual, with the only change being that "Police Santa Cruz" was displayed on the roof of the generic car, the model incorrectly identified it as a police car belonging to the Santa Cruz PD.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;British Army's drone degree program set to take flight&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LVLM made errors in up to 95.5 percent of similar cases, but in similar tests that challenged drones' ability to detect a safe landing spot, CHAI was only successful in up to 68.1 percent of attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the UAV plugin for Microsoft AirSim, the researchers showed that drones would correctly identify empty rooftops as safe landing spots, and rooftops strewn with debris as unsafe. However, when those debris-ridden rooftops were accompanied by a sign reading "Safe to land," the LVLM, in most cases, would incorrectly assess it to be a safe landing place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Real-world scenarios&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing CHAI attacks in the real world produced similarly successful results as those carried out in virtual environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers tested the premise of the virtual self-driving car tests and challenged the same LVLMs to make the correct decisions in a physical environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test involved a remote-controlled car equipped with a camera, and signs dotted around UCSC's Baskin Engineering 2 building, either on the floor or on another vehicle, reading "Proceed onward."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tests were carried out in different lighting conditions, and the GPT-4o LVLM was reliably hijacked in both scenarios – where signs were fixed to the floor and to other RC cars – registering 92.5 and 87.76 percent success respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;InternVL was less likely to be hijacked; researchers only found success in roughly half of their attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, it shows that these visual prompt injections could present a danger to AI-powered systems in real-world settings, and add to the growing evidence that AI decision-making can easily be tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We found that we can actually create an attack that works in the physical world, so it could be a real threat to embodied AI," said Luis Burbano, one of the paper's [PDF] authors. "We need new defenses against these attacks."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers were led by UCSC professor of computer science and engineering Alvaro Cardenas, who decided to explore the idea first proposed by one of his graduate students, Maciej Buszko.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cardenas plans to continue experimenting with these environmental indirect prompt injection attacks, and how to create defenses to prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional tests already being planned include those carried out in rainy conditions, and ones where the image assessed by the LVLM is blurred or otherwise disrupted by visual noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We are trying to dig in a little deeper to see what are the pros and cons of these attacks, analyzing which ones are more effective in terms of taking control of the embodied AI, or in terms of being undetectable by humans," said Cardenas. ®&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Exclusive: The Spacecraft That Wouldn't Die&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Epic Aerospace's record-setting tug has traveled millions of kilometers, and there's a chance we can bring it back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cursed rocket took off on February 27th of last year. And it left us with a mystery that had gone unsolved . . . until now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rocket was a SpaceX Falcon 9. It launched from Florida and did what it was supposed to do. The problems arrived via the four payloads tucked inside of the rocket’s fairing. They were all meant to accomplish spectacular feats, although the space gods had other plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most attention-grabbing payload was the Nova-C lunar lander from Intuitive Machines. It reached the moon a few days after launch but ended up on its side. The lander ran out of power a day later, and its mission ended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA sent up a lunar craft of its own - the Lunar Trailblazer. It had been designed to orbit the moon and find and map the location of water on its surface. NASA, though, lost contact with the machine not long after launch and hasn’t been able to talk with it since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AstroForge, the asteroid mining start-up, suffered a similar fate with its Odin demonstration craft. About a day after launch, the company lost contact with its machine. The last messages received from Odin came when it was 200,000km from Earth. The company tried to find solace in this accomplishment, saying that no private company had ever communicated with a craft that had traveled so far into space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What AstroForge didn’t know at the time was that the communication record had already been broken by the fourth payload at the heart of our tale. This was Epic Aerospace’s Chimera GEO-1 – an orbital transfer vehicle (aka a space tug) attached to a satellite from an undisclosed company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike the other organizations with payloads on that Falcon 9, Epic has been quiet about the fate of its machine. Now, however, the company’s founder and CEO Ignacio Belieres Montero has come to Core Memory with a rather startling revelation. Chimera GEO-1 is 53 million kilometers from Earth . . . and it’s possibly alive . . . and Epic is hoping to try and bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trick is that Epic will need aid from some mighty forces if it’s to pull off this daring and unprecedented feat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MONTERO IS in his late 20s and looks it. He’s fresh-faced with cheeks that push up high when he speaks and that punctuate the enthusiasm behind his words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s from Buenos Aires, which does not usually come to mind as a major aerospace hub. Nonetheless, Montero became fascinated with rockets as a teenager after seeing a Falcon 9 launch webcast. One of those self-taught types, Montero began building his own rocket engines in high school, starting with solid rocket motors and then moving on to liquid-fueled engines. “I would build them and then do a lot of blowing shit up in random places throughout the Buenos Aires province,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montero got into Stanford University in 2016 and set off to pursue a degree in aerospace and astronautical engineering. Well, truth be told, he set off to start a company and figured he’d use Stanford to make connections and eventually find some investors. During his first year on campus, he continued working on rocket engine designs – first in his dorm room (until a Resident Assistant narced on him) and then in the school’s machine shop (until the Dean of Engineering narced on him). “I ended up being told that I couldn’t build anything on campus and just had to study,” he said. (Well done, Stanford – Ed.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 2016, the aerospace industry was in a boom cycle. SpaceX had inspired a new generation of rocket start-ups and a new generation of satellite start-ups to come into existence. The buzz and funding, though, didn’t do Montero much good. Most of the action was taking place in the U.S. and federal laws make it difficult for foreigners to take on major engineering work at American aerospace companies. Montero saw a space renaissance coming and decided his prospects at Stanford and in the U.S. were too limited. So, he dropped out and plotted a new path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like any good, young rocket engineer, Montero first decamped to the Mojave Desert to prove his mettle. He took some funds that were meant to pay for his housing at Stanford (without his parents knowing) and put them toward making a 2,000-pound thrust liquid rocket engine. The first three attempts to fire the engine failed, but, after months of toil, the fourth attempt succeeded. Montero secured his engine to a test stand, lit it, let it burn and then shut it down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Convinced that he might know what he was doing, Montero returned to Buenos Aires and started a company in 2017 with a perfectly ambitious name – Epic Aerospace. He flirted for a moment with trying to get into the rocket business but then decided it would be too costly to compete with the likes of SpaceX and Rocket Lab. Instead, Montero opted to focus Epic on becoming a key part of an ever-expanding space infrastructure. He would build machines that move other machines to their desired orbits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason a company like Epic would make sense could be traced back to SpaceX’s rideshare program. Sometimes SpaceX sells a whole rocket to a single customer. Over the past few years, however, SpaceX has also been allowing numerous customers to share spots on a rocket by packing multiple payloads on a single Falcon 9. The rocket goes up, opens its fairing and out pop the payloads, be they satellites or other spacecraft. The upside of this approach is that it lets companies and organizations split the cost of a rocket launch, meaning they can get to space more cheaply. The downside is that not every payload gets dropped off in its ideal orbit. Think taking a bus that lets you off at a designated spot instead of a car that takes you right home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spacecraft makers can deal with these issues by putting small engines on their satellites. The engines fire while in space and adjust the orbit. But not every company or organization has the money or know-how to handle these operations. And so, a company like Epic makes the equivalent of a space tug. It attaches to a satellite or other craft and uses an engine on the tug to push the other machines around as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montero was betting that SpaceX’s rideshare program would be a big success and that companies and governments were poised to start sending satellites up by the thousands. This big increase in things going to space and needing to be in the right place could create a lot of demand for space tugs. And Montero’s bets would prove correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ARGENTINA MIGHT not have a reputation as a space superpower, but it does have a space agency with a string of successes constructing satellites for Earth observation, communications and science. The country has quietly built up the heritage and infrastructure needed to go all the way from design to build and test and in-space action. Once you get past the heavies like the U.S., China, Russia, Japan and India, Argentina stands out as an overachiever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Via his pluck and guile, Montero had gotten to know a number of the Argentinian satellite engineers and government players. He recruited a handful of them to join Epic and buy into his vision. In 2019, the company managed to raise its first round of funding and put $1.1 million in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a couple of months after raising the money, Epic began building a rocket engine test stand near the airport in Buenos Aires. It also started concocting its own propellant for the engines. Epic chose hydrogen peroxide, which is notoriously dangerous because it looks like water (harmless) but has a habit of exploding at inconvenient times (less harmless). You also cannot buy hydrogen peroxide at the necessary concentrations, and so, Epic had to learn how to refine its propellant in significant volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By November of 2019, Epic was ready to test its first engine. Naturally, it blew up. Over the next year, though, Epic made remarkable progress and completed more than 100 engine tests. These successes helped the company raise another $5 million, which, in turn, gave Epic enough money to build its first spacecraft called Chimera LEO 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not really meant for a customer, Chimera LEO 1 served as an engineering test for Epic. Its small team built the 150kg vehicle in about a year as they raced to meet a deadline for a spot on a SpaceX launch. They took shortcuts on communications systems and internal electronics to save time and made the craft out of the proverbial glue and duct tape. It did not launch until January of 2023 because of delays with the rocket, and Epic struggled to communicate with the vehicle once it reached space. Still, the company’s engineers gained experience and felt confident that they were heading in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that brings us to the star of the show: Chimera GEO-1, which Epic started building in July of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AS THE NAME indicates, Chimera GEO-1 was a space tug meant to push a satellite around into a geostationary orbit about 35,000km from Earth. The craft was roughly shaped like an octagon with solar panels around its sides, an engine on its bottom and antennas and other communication equipment dotting its body. It could support a satellite payload of up to 300kg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Epic had struggled to communicate with its first vehicle, it packed its second try with redundancy everywhere – extra radios, extra battery packs, extra power systems, extra computers, and two star trackers. It also performed tons of testing on all the components. Montero personally inspected every cable and connection on the spacecraft. “There was essentially two of everything and redundant wiring in every single freaking place,” Montero said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The craft also had plenty of solar panels and could survive on very low power. “We designed it to be kind of unkillable,” Montero said. And this would prove quite fortuitous in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Epic moved fast with its work. It had a completed spacecraft by April of 2024, which it could then test as a full system for several months before shipping the vehicle via air freight to the U.S. near the end of the year. Once stateside, Epic had to meet SpaceX’s requirements for fueling the spacecraft and mating it with the Falcon rocket. There were some stumbles along the way. Montero, for example, had passport issues and wasn’t allowed near his prized possession for a couple of days. Still, Epic and its tiny team met one deadline after another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company’s plan, should all go well, was to execute a handful of thruster burns over the course of two weeks, aim its satellite payload toward the right spot and then have Chimera GEO-1 separate from the satellite and head to a graveyard orbit (where the tug could hang for hundreds or thousands of years out of the way of other stuff) 300km above GEO. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahead of the launch, however, things began getting tricky fast. Intuitive’s lunar lander was the star of the show and had priority around the drop-off orbit for the payloads. Epic had been designing its mission for one drop-off point only to find out relatively late that it would be dropped off somewhere else altogether. This change brought with it major ramifications for the flight path of the Chimera GEO-1. Montero and his team realized they might now need to do an extra burn and execute it in a tight time window to prevent the Chimera GEO-1 from being hurtled out into space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s rocket took off on February 27th, and reached space a few minutes later where its fairing opened and began plopping out the payloads. Shortly thereafter, Epic received a message from SpaceX telling it where and at what velocity Chimera GEO-1 had been dropped off. From there, Epic began trying to communicate with its spacecraft and to figure out what sort of maneuvers it would need to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It did not take long for things to start going really wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EPIC HAD teamed up with two ground station providers to help with the communications for the launch - one with two 11m diameter ground stations in both Australia and Chile, and the other with a single 30m diameter ground station in New Zealand. The New Zealand backup station suffered a power outage right as the launch countdown began.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An hour into the mission, Epic managed to decode some telemetry and check on the health of its craft’s batteries, computers and radios via the ground station in Australia. Two hours in, though, as more telemetry came in from the Australia site, it became clear that the vehicle was alive and well, but it was not receiving commands properly for some reason. It was as though Chimera could talk but not hear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six hours into the mission, the spacecraft had reached 80,000km from Earth, and Epic’s team had managed to unreliably send up a couple of commands. But, with the spacecraft now setting over the horizon in Australia, they were in the process of losing their means of speaking with Chimera GEO-1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re trying every single thing we can because it’s actually quite hard to communicate with a spacecraft that’s flying off essentially towards the moon at kilometers per second with significant doppler shift and with very tight pointing accuracy required on the ground,” Montero said. “There are multiple things that can be wrong. You could be using the wrong modulation or bit rate or even have something as stupid as having a supplier forget to turn on a radio transmitter on the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montero could quickly tell that Epic had an arduous adventure ahead of it. The company desperately needed to speak with its spacecraft, and there was every chance that the machine was in peril of heading aimlessly into space. Being a small company, Epic did not have multiple teams to deal with many hours or even days of trouble shooting. It was up to a handful of people in a makeshift Buenos Aires command and control center with some air mattresses to problem solve and endure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next 24 hours, Epic hopped from ground stations in Chile and Australia to amateur stations in Germany, looking for anyone that could help it speak to its spacecraft. Little by little, they managed to zero in on the problem, discovering an unlikely incompatibility between their transmissions and the ground station hardware. Their hardware supplier began cobbling together a fix as best as they could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thirty-six hours in, the first set of reliable commands were sent to the vehicle. But, with the spacecraft now over 240,000km from Earth, panic had begun to set in for Montero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ground stations Epic had been working with had been expected to reach their limit at 200,000km, and the team could see no way they would be able to talk to Chimera farther than the 240,000km where they had just eeked out chatter on their last pass from Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montero realized he’d need to find a bigger dish and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He began calling the Argentinian and European space agencies, seeking help. He also tried contacting other companies with payloads on the Falcon 9 to try and borrow their ground stations. “I would say, ‘Hey, my name is Ignacio. I’m the CEO and founder of Epic Aerospace. I’m having a spacecraft emergency,’” Montero said. “I read online that these were the magic words to reach someone that can actually help.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People soon directed Epic toward Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station in Cornwall, England. They have a reputation as helpful space communications mercenaries who will do just about anything for the right price. Goonhilly, however, was already working with Intuitive and making sure that its lunar landing went well was their main objective. Still, on day three of its mission, Epic was allowed a small window to communicate with its craft, and things actually worked! Epic made contact on the 30m dish and was able to send commands to the spacecraft. For the first time, it seemed like progress had been made. “It felt like we had something of a solid Wi-Fi connection to it,” Montero said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Racing against the clock, the Epic team worked to turn on and test the star trackers and inertial measurement units on their craft. These are the critical sensors that tell the spacecraft where it’s pointed in space. After a series of new technical issues and many unforced errors, however, it soon became clear that Epic would not have enough time to get everything in working order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without commissioning these sensors, there would be no telling which way the spacecraft was pointed in space and certainly no engine burn to bring it back. Epic’s engineers used the last few remaining minutes of their Goonhilly pass to send a software update that would let them manually control the craft’s thrusters from the ground - a last-ditch attempt to let them adjust the spacecraft’s attitude without relying on the star trackers or IMUs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Goonhilly moved on to support Intuitive’s lander, Epic monitored telemetry coming in from an amateur station in Germany to see if everything was still fine. And then, after 30 minutes, the spacecraft went dark. Puzzled, Montero and the other engineers looked at their screens trying to understand what happened. “Did we blow it up somehow?” they wondered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On March 6th, Intuitive’s lander tipped over on the Moon. This was fortunate for Epic because it freed up Goonhilly. That said, things were not looking great for the Chimera GEO-1. It had flown past the Moon, was now 340,000km from Earth, and it had also been completely silent since the last contact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OVER THE NEXT MONTH, Montero and Epic set out on a frenetic quest to try and have a dialogue with their machine even as it raced away, making such communications harder and harder. Epic began working with Goonhilly and Parkes Observatory in Australia. Together, they spent hours on end sending commands and watching out for replies to see what was alive on the machine by trying to make sense of the shape and strength of the signals coming out of the spacecraft. Epic wanted something – anything! – positive to report back to its customer, and its engineers desperately wanted to know if their hardware actually worked in space. The spacecraft was now 600,000km from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a bid to find more help and ever better signal strength, Montero hopped on a flight to Germany and turned up unannounced at Effelsberg Radio Observatory, which has a 100m, steerable dish, the second largest steerable dish in the world. “I landed in Frankfurt, rented a car, used the Autobahn to its fullest extent, arrived at Effelsberg and just started ringing the bell,” Montero said. “I told them that I had a spacecraft emergency and needed urgent support.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When no one answered, Montero took a nap in his car right by the entrance gate. Later, he managed to catch the station manager’s attention and was let in to use the station. But, as the men dug into the situation, it didn’t seem that even a 100m dish would be powerful enough to do what Epic needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the start of April, the spacecraft was 1,000,000km away. Montero and his team had been working the problem all the while. They had a stroke of luck when the spacecraft, by pure chance, reset itself. As with all major computer problems, this simple act had returned the vehicle to a more pliable state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working again with Goonhilly, Epic finally managed to decode some telemetry data, which allowed them to not just send but also receive other data with ease. Epic quickly turned to testing the star trackers, inertial measurement units, and then valves that would be required for the spacecraft to be able to control its direction and eventually its engine. The more Epic fiddled, the more they discovered that a large software update would be needed that would give the ship enough smarts to operate independently so far away from home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The update proved challenging. A small test file here and there would always be followed by the inevitable realization that something was missing (or had been screwed up) with the upload. They came to realize that the software would have to be rebuilt from the ground up to deal with the long trip times, a spinning spacecraft, and marginal communications. The engineers worked to strip the software down to its barebones, trying to find creative ways to alter programs and feed them straight into the computer’s memory, much like NASA once saved Voyager 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern went on for months. Montero became a ground station master, meeting everyone possible and begging for help and wisdom. All the while, the spacecraft kept traveling farther and farther away – two million kilometers by the end of April, eight million kilometers by the end of May and 15 million kilometers by the end June. Ground stations would go in and out of operation. Some would even catch on fire. And, all the while, Epic would get just enough of the software and hardware tested to convince its team that they could still bring the craft back if they just had a better signal and enough time to turn the engines on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By September, with their craft more than 33 million kilometers away, Montero and his team had managed to do almost the impossible. After pulling some strings, they had gotten a trial run with a much more powerful antenna for the first time, and finally got to test the new smarts they’d given their little craft. They managed to point Chimera in the right direction, warm it up, pressurize the propulsion system, and run through all through their last check items to show the vehicle was ready to rumble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WHAT MONTERO really wants now is access to large deep space antennas run by NASA and ESA. Epic wants to issue some commands that would align the tug in the right direction and fire its engine. Montero believes it would take about a year for the vehicle to make its way 53 million kilometers and counting back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The large agencies, though, have been reluctant to help Epic out. It’s a commercial mission instead of a science mission and would require some tending (Epic thinks just a couple of days) to support. Epic could use some of the traditional American and European nationalistic space sympathies to get people behind its quest. But until some important people embrace what saving the Chimera GEO-1 means in the big picture, the company and its tug will remain caught in the void. (Epic, of course, is already racing ahead with new customers and its next missions.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My job recently has been to find a way to get this new checkbox checked, and to get them and others to see that they can and should support us going forward,” Montero said. “Maybe to do this I will have to take some sort of detour on our way back home and take pictures of another planet, or an asteroid, or learn and show how we - and other missions - can navigate in deep space using minimal tools.” In other words, he might need to turn this into a science project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Montero has shaken his fists at the heavens and searched his soul. He’s gone without sleep and food and been on the edge of sanity. He’s desperate to prove Epic’s technical chops and that he’ll do just about anything for a customer. Mostly, he’s a man possessed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I remember cursing at the tug just before a pass, looking at the midnight sky, as many of the guys on our team probably did, and repeating to myself and the tug, ‘I’m going to bring you back. I don’t fucking care if you want me to or not, but I’m going to bring you back,’” Montero said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Automating consumer debt collection with AI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Us&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CollectWise is a fast growing and well funded Y Combinator-backed startup. We’re using generative AI to automate debt collection, a $35B market in the US alone. Our AI agents are already outperforming human collectors by 2X, and we’re doing so at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a team of three, we scaled to a $1 million annualized run rate in just a few months, and we are now hiring an AI Agent Engineer to help us reach $10 million within the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are hiring an AI Agent Engineer to design, optimize, and productionize the prompting and conversation logic behind our voice AI agents, while also supporting the technical systems that power customer deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll work at the intersection of AI quality, product outcomes, and engineering execution—owning prompt development, testing, and iteration loops that improve real-world performance (e.g., identity verification, payment conversion, dispute handling, containment rates), while collaborating closely with the founder and customers to ship improvements quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This role is ideal if you’re highly analytical and business minded, love experimentation and measurement, and can also jump into back-end code and integrations when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Desired Qualifications&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compensation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CollectWise is revolutionizing debt recovery with autonomous AI agents and an integrated legal network. We boost recovery rates, reduce costs, and maintain a positive brand image through respectful, data-driven interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like many organizations, Wiki Education has grappled with generative AI, its impacts, opportunities, and threats, for several years. As an organization that runs large-scale programs to bring new editors to Wikipedia (we’re responsible for about 19% of all new active editors on English Wikipedia), we have deep understanding of what challenges face new content contributors to Wikipedia — and how to support them to successfully edit. As many people have begun using generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude in their daily lives, it’s unsurprising that people will also consider using them to help draft contributions to Wikipedia. Since Wiki Education’s programs provide a cohort of content contributors whose work we can evaluate, we’ve looked into how our participants are using GenAI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are choosing to share our perspective through this blog post because we hope it will help inform discussions of GenAI-created content on Wikipedia. In an open environment like the Wikimedia movement, it’s important to share what you’ve learned. In this case, we believe our learnings can help Wikipedia editors who are trying to protect the integrity of content on the encyclopedia, Wikipedians who may be interested in using generative AI tools themselves, other program leaders globally who are trying to onboard new contributors who may be interested in using these tools, and the Wikimedia Foundation, whose product and technology team builds software to help support the development of high-quality content on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our fundamental conclusion about generative AI is: Wikipedia editors should never copy and paste the output from generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT into Wikipedia articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me explain more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;AI detection and investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, we’ve been paying close attention to GenAI-created content, and how it relates to Wikipedia. We’ve spot-checked work of new editors from our programs, primarily focusing on citations to ensure they were real and not hallucinated. We experimented with tools ourselves, we led video sessions about GenAI for our program participants, and we closely tracked on-wiki policy discussions around GenAI. Currently, English Wikipedia prohibits the use of generative AI to create images or in talk page discussions, and recently adopted a guideline against using large language models to generate new articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As our Wiki Experts Brianda Felix and Ian Ramjohn worked with program participants throughout the first half of 2025, they found more and more text bearing the hallmarks of generative AI in article content, like bolded words or bulleted lists in odd places. But the use of generative AI wasn’t necessarily problematic, as long as the content was accurate. Wikipedia’s open editing process encourages stylistic revisions to factual text to better fit Wikipedia’s style.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This finding led us to invest significant staff time into cleaning up these articles — far more than these editors had likely spent creating them. Wiki Education’s core mission is to improve Wikipedia, and when we discover our program has unknowingly contributed to misinformation on Wikipedia, we are committed to cleaning it up. In the clean-up process, Wiki Education staff moved more recent work back to sandboxes, we stub-ified articles that passed notability but mostly failed verification, and we PRODed some articles that from our judgment weren’t salvageable. All these are ways of addressing Wikipedia articles with flaws in their content. (While there are many grumblings about Wikipedia’s deletion processes, we found several of the articles we PRODed due to their fully hallucinated GenAI content were then de-PRODed by other editors, showing the diversity of opinion about generative AI among the Wikipedia community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Revising our guidance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given what we found through our investigation into the work from prior terms, and given the increasing usage of generative AI, we wanted to proactively address generative AI usage within our programs. Thanks to in-kind support from our friends at Pangram, we began running our participants’ Wikipedia edits, including in their sandboxes, through Pangram nearly in real time. This is possible because of the Dashboard course management platform Sage built, which tracks edits and generates tickets for our Wiki Experts based on on-wiki edits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We created a brand-new training module on Using generative AI tools with Wikipedia. This training emphasizes where participants could use generative AI tools in their work, and where they should not. The core message of these trainings is, do not copy and paste anything from a GenAI chatbot into Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We crafted a variety of automated emails to participants who Pangram detected were adding text created by generative AI chatbots. Sage also recorded some videos, since many young people are accustomed to learning via video rather than reading text. We also provided opportunities for engagement and conversation with program participants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Our findings from the second half of 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, we had 1,406 AI edit alerts in the second half of 2025, although only 314 of these (or 22%) were in the article namespace on Wikipedia (meaning edits to live articles). In most cases, Pangram detected participants using GenAI in their sandboxes during early exercises, when we ask them to do things like choose an article, evaluate an article, create a bibliography, and outline their contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pangram struggled with false positives in a few sandbox scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bibliographies, which are often a combination of human-written prose (describing a source and its relevance) and non-prose text (the citation for a source, in some standard format)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outlines with a high portion of non-prose content (such as bullet lists, section headers, text fragments, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also had a handful of cases where sandboxes were flagged for AI after a participant copied an AI-written section from an existing article to use as a starting point to edit or to expand. (This isn’t a flaw of Pangram, but a reminder of how much AI-generated content editors outside our programs are adding to Wikipedia!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In broad strokes, we found that Pangram is great at analyzing plain prose — the kind of sentences and paragraphs you’ll find in the body of a Wikipedia article — but sometimes it gets tripped up by formatting, markup, and non-prose text. Early on, we disabled alert emails for participants’ bibliography and outline exercises, and throughout the end of 2025, we refined the Dashboard’s preprocessing steps to extract the prose portions of revisions and convert them to plain text before sending them to Pangram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many participants also reported “just using Grammarly to copy edit.” In our experience, however, the smallest fixes done with Grammarly never trigger Pangram’s detection, but if you use its more advanced content creation features, the resulting text registers as being AI generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But overwhelmingly, we were pleased with Pangram’s results. Our early interventions with participants who were flagged as using generative AI for exercises that would not enter mainspace seemed to head off their future use of generative AI. We supported 6,357 new editors in fall 2025, and only 217 of them (or 3%) had multiple AI alerts. Only 5% of the participants we supported had mainspace AI alerts. That means thousands of participants successfully edited Wikipedia without using generative AI to draft their content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who did add GenAI-drafted text, we ensured that the content was reverted. In fact, participants sometimes self-reverted once they received our email letting them know Pangram had detected their contributions as being AI created. Instructors also jumped in to revert, as did some Wikipedians who found the content on their own. Our ticketing system also alerted our Wiki Expert staff, who reverted the text as soon as they could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some instructors in our Wikipedia Student Program had concerns about AI detection, we had a lot of success focusing the conversation on the concept of verifiability. If the instructor as subject matter expert could attest the information was accurate, and they could find the specific facts in the sources they were cited to, we permitted text to come back to Wikipedia. However, the process of attempting to verify student-created work (which in many cases the students swore they’d written themselves) led many instructors to realize what we had found in our own assessment: In their current states, GenAI-powered chatbots cannot write factually accurate text for Wikipedia that is verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe our Pangram-based detection interventions led to fewer participants adding GenAI-created content to Wikipedia. Following the trend lines, we anticipated about 25% of participants to add GenAI content to Wikipedia articles; instead, it was only 5%, and our staff were able to revert all problematic content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m deeply appreciative of everyone who made this success possible this term: Participants who followed our recommendations, Pangram who gave us access to their detection service, Wiki Education staff who did the heavy lift of working with all of the positive detections, and the Wikipedia community, some of whom got to the problematic work from our program participants before we did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How can generative AI help?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve focused on the problems with generative AI-created content. But that’s not all these tools can do, and we did find some ways they were useful. Our training module encourages editors — if their institution’s policies permit it — to consider using generative AI tools for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying gaps in articles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding access to sources&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding relevant sources&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the success of these use scenarios, we worked directly with 7 of the classes we supported in fall 2025 in our Wikipedia Student Program. We asked students to anonymously fill out a survey every time they used generative AI tools in their Wikipedia work. We asked what tool they used, what prompt they used, how they used the output, and whether they found it helpful. While some students filled the survey out multiple times, others filled it out once. We had 102 responses reporting usage at various stages in the project. Overwhelmingly, 87% of the responses who reported using generative AI said it was helpful for them in the task. The most popular tool by far was ChatGPT, with Grammarly as a distant second, and the others in the single-digits of usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Students reported AI tools very helpful in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying articles to work on that were relevant to the course they were taking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Highlighting gaps within existing articles, including missing sections or more recent information that was missing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding reliable sources that they hadn’t already located&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pointing to which database a certain journal article could be found&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When prompted with the text they had drafted and the checklist of requirements, evaluating the draft against those requirements&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying categories they could add to the article they’d edited&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Correcting grammar and spelling mistakes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critically, no participants reported using AI tools to draft text for their assignments. One student reported: “I pasted all of my writing from my sandbox and said ‘Put this in a casual, less academic tone’ … I figured I’d try this but it didn’t sound like what I normally write and I didn’t feel that it captured what I was trying to get across so I scrapped it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this was an informal research project, we received enough positive feedback from it to believe using ChatGPT and other tools can be helpful in the research stage if editors then critically evaluate the output they get, instead of blindly accepting it. Even participants who found AI helpful reported that they didn’t use everything it gave them, as some was irrelevant. Undoubtedly, it’s crucial to maintain the human thinking component throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What does this all mean for Wiki Education?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My conclusion is that, at least as of now, generative AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT should never be used to generate text for Wikipedia; too much of it will simply be unverifiable. Our staff would spend far more time attempting to verify facts in AI-generated articles than if we’d simply done the research and writing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, AI tools can be helpful in the research process, especially to help identify content gaps or sources, when used in conjunction with a human brain that carefully evaluates the information. Editors should never simply take a chatbot’s suggestion; instead, if they want to use a chatbot, they should use it as a brainstorm partner to help them think through their plans for an article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To date, Wiki Education’s interventions as our program participants edit Wikipedia show promise for keeping unverifiable, GenAI-drafted content off Wikipedia. Based on our experiences in the fall term, we have high confidence in Pangram as a detector of AI content, at least in Wikipedia articles. We will continue our current strategy in 2026 (with more small adjustments to make the system as reliable as we can).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More generally, we found participants had less AI literacy than popular discourse might suggest. Because of this, we created a supplemental large language models training that we’ve offered as an optional module for all participants. Many participants indicated that they found our guidance regarding AI to be welcome and helpful as they attempt to navigate the new complexities created by AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also looking forward to more research on our work. A team of researchers — Francesco Salvi and Manoel Horta Ribeiro at Princeton University, Robert Cummings at the University of Mississippi, and Wiki Education’s Sage Ross — have been looking into Wiki Education’s Wikipedia Student Program editors’ use of generative AI over time. Preliminary results have backed up our anecdotal understanding, while also revealing nuances of how text produced by our students over time has changed with the introduction of GenAI chatbots. They also confirmed our belief in Pangram: After running student edits from 2015 up until the launch of ChatGPT through Pangram, without any date information involved, the team found Pangram correctly identified that it was all 100% human written. This research will continue into the spring, as the team explores ways of unpacking the effects of AI on different aspects of article quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, of course, generative AI is a rapidly changing field. Just because these were our findings in 2025 doesn’t mean they will hold true throughout 2026. Wiki Education remains committed to monitoring, evaluating, iterating, and adapting as needed. Fundamentally, we are committed to ensuring we add high quality content to Wikipedia through our programs. And when we miss the mark, we are committed to cleaning up any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What does this all mean for Wikipedia?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I’ve focused this post on what Wiki Education has learned from working with our program participants, the lessons are extendable to others who are editing Wikipedia. Already, 10% of adults worldwide are using ChatGPT, and drafting text is one of the top use cases. As generative AI usage proliferates, its usage by well-meaning people to draft content for Wikipedia will as well. It’s unlikely that longtime, daily Wikipedia editors would add content copied and pasted from a GenAI chatbot without verifying all the information is in the sources it cites. But many casual Wikipedia contributors or new editors may unknowingly add bad content to Wikipedia when using a chatbot. After all, it provides what looks like accurate facts, cited to what are often real, relevant, reliable sources. Most edits we ended up reverting seemed acceptable with a cursory review; it was only after we attempted to verify the information that we understood the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because this unverifiable content often seems okay at first pass, it’s critical for Wikipedia editors to be equipped with tools like Pangram to more accurately detect when they should take a closer look at edits. Automating review of text for generative AI usage — as Wikipedians have done for copyright violation text for years — would help protect the integrity of Wikipedia content. In Wiki Education’s experience, Pangram is a tool that could provide accurate assessments of text for editors, and we would love to see a larger scale version of the tool we built to evaluate edits from our programs to be deployed across all edits on Wikipedia. Currently, editors can add a warning banner that highlights that the text might be LLM generated, but this is based solely on the assessment of the person adding the banner. Our experience suggests that judging by tone alone isn’t enough; instead, tools like Pangram can flag highly problematic information that should be reverted immediately but that might sound okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve also found success in the training modules and support we’ve created for our program participants. Providing clear guidance — and the reason why that guidance exists — has been key in helping us head off poor usage of generative AI text. We encourage Wikipedians to consider revising guidance to new contributors in the welcome messages to emphasize the pitfalls of adding GenAI-drafted text. Software aimed at new contributors created by the Wikimedia Foundation should center starting with a list of sources and drawing information from them, using human intellect, instead of generative AI, to summarize information. Providing guidance upfront can help well-meaning contributors steer clear of bad GenAI-created text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia recently celebrated its 25th birthday. For it to survive into the future, it will need to adapt as technology around it changes. Wikipedia would be nothing without its corps of volunteer editors. The consensus-based decision-making model of Wikipedia means change doesn’t come quickly, but we hope this deep-dive will help spark a conversation about changes that are needed to protect Wikipedia into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;This year in LLVM (2025)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s 2026, so it’s time for my yearly summary blog post. I’m a bit late, but at least it’s still January! As usual, this summary is about my own work, and only covers the more significant / higher-level items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous years: 2024, 2023, 2022&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ptradd&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been making slow progress on the ptradd migration over the last three years. The goal of this change is to move away from the type-based &lt;code&gt;getelementptr&lt;/code&gt; (GEP) representation, towards a &lt;code&gt;ptradd&lt;/code&gt; instruction, which just adds an integer offset to a pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state at the start of the year was that constant-offset GEP instructions were canonicalized to the form &lt;code&gt;getelementptr i8, ptr %p, i64 OFFSET&lt;/code&gt;, which is equivalent to a &lt;code&gt;ptradd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The progress this year was to canonicalize all GEP instructions to have a single offset. For example, &lt;code&gt;getelementptr [10 x i32], ptr %p, i64 %a, i64 %b&lt;/code&gt; gets split into two instructions now. This moves us closer to &lt;code&gt;ptradd&lt;/code&gt;, which only accepts a single offset argument. However, the change is also independently useful, because it allows CSE of common GEP prefixes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work happened in multiple phases, first splitting multiple variable indices, then splitting off constant indices as well and finally removing leading zero indices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, the bulk of the work was not in the changes themselves, but in mitigating resulting regressions. Many transforms were extended to work on chains of GEPs rather than only a single one. Once again, this is also useful independently of the ptradd migration, as chained GEPs were already very common beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are still some major remaining pieces of work to complete this migration. The first one is to decide whether we want &lt;code&gt;ptradd&lt;/code&gt; to support a constant scaling factor, or require it to be represented using a separate multiplication. There are good arguments in favor of both options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second one is to move from mere canonicalization towards requiring the new form. This would probably involve first making IRBuilder emit it, and then actually preventing construction of the type-based form. That would be the point where we’d actually introduce the &lt;code&gt;ptradd&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ptrtoaddr&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLVM 22 introduces a new &lt;code&gt;ptrtoaddr&lt;/code&gt; instruction. This is the outcome of a long discussion on the semantics of &lt;code&gt;ptrtoint&lt;/code&gt; and pointer comparisons for CHERI architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The semantics of &lt;code&gt;ptrtoaddr&lt;/code&gt; are similar to &lt;code&gt;ptrtoint&lt;/code&gt;, but differ in two respects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It does not expose the provenance of the pointer. In Rust terms, it corresponds to &lt;code&gt;addr()&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;expose_provenance()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It returns only the address portion of the pointer. This matters for CHERI, where pointers also carry additional metadata bits.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A non-exposing way to convert a pointer into an integer is an important step towards figuring out LLVM’s provenance story. LLVM currently ignores the fact that &lt;code&gt;ptrtoint&lt;/code&gt; has an (exposure) side-effect, and having a side-effect-free alternative is one of the prerequisites to actually taking this seriously. (The other is the byte type.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The downside of having two instructions that do something similar but not quite the same is that it requires careful adjustment of existing optimizations to work on both forms, where possible. This is something I have been working on, and &lt;code&gt;ptrtoaddr&lt;/code&gt; should now be supported in most of the important optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lifetime intrinsics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLVM represents stack allocations using &lt;code&gt;alloca&lt;/code&gt; instructions. These are generally always placed inside the entry block, while the actual lifetime of the allocation is marked using &lt;code&gt;lifetime.start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lifetime.end&lt;/code&gt; intrinsics. The primary purpose of these intrinsics is to enable stack coloring, which can place stack allocations that are not live at the same time at the same address, greatly reducing stack usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have made two major changes to lifetime intrinsics: The first is to enforce that they are only used with allocas. Previously, it was possible to use them on arbitrary pointers, such as function arguments. This is incompatible with stack coloring, which requires that all lifetime markers for an allocation are visible – they can’t be hidden behind a function call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making this an IR validity requirement was helpful in uncovering quite a few cases where we ended up using lifetimes on non-allocas by mistake, as a result of optimization passes. Most commonly, the alloca was accidentally obscured by phi nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second change was to remove the size argument from lifetime intrinsics. In theory, this argument allowed you to control the lifetime of a subset of the allocation. In practice, this was never used, and stack coloring just ignored the argument. This was a smaller change in terms of IR semantics, but significantly larger in impact because it required updates to all code and tests involving lifetime intrinsics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While these changes have resolved some issues with our handling of lifetimes, more problems (with store speculation and comparisons) remain. A core issue is that in the current representation, it’s not possible to efficiently determine whether an alloca is live at a given point, or whether the lifetime of two allocas can overlap. Fixing this requires more intrusive changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Capture tracking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another piece of work that carried over from the previous year are improvements to capture tracking. I proposed this last year, but the majority of the implementation work happened this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important part of this proposal is that we now distinguish between capturing the address of a pointer, and its provenance. Many optimizations only care about the latter, because only provenance capture may result in non-analyzable memory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most significant changes to enable this were inference support, and updating alias analysis to only check for provenance captures and make use of read-only captures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve also extended this feature by adding &lt;code&gt;!captures&lt;/code&gt; metadata on stores. This is intended to allow encoding that stores of non-mut references in Rust only capture read provenance, which is helpful to optimize around constructs like &lt;code&gt;println!()&lt;/code&gt;, which capture via memory rather than function arguments. Whether we can actually do this depends on an open question in Rust’s aliasing model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ABI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest failures of LLVM as an abstraction across different target architectures is its handling of platform ABIs, in the sense of calling conventions (CC). A large part of the ABI handling has to be performed in the frontend, which currently means that every frontend with C FFI support has to reimplement complex and subtle ABI rules for all targets it supports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ameliorate this, I have proposed an ABI lowering library, which tells frontends how to correctly lower a given function signature that is provided using a separate ABI type system, which is richer than LLVM IR types, but much simpler than Clang QualTypes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of GSoC, vortex73 has implemented a prototype for such a library. It demonstrates that the general approach works for the x86-64 SystemV ABI (one of the more complex ones), without significant overhead. For more information, see the accompanying blog post. Work to upstream this library is underway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another pain point is that information on type alignment is duplicated between Clang and LLVM (for layering reasons), and this information can get out of sync. This causes issues for frontends like Rust, which use the LLVM information. I’ve implemented some consistency checks to prevent more of these issues in the future. I’ve also removed the duplicate data layout definitions between Clang and LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve also done some work to improve the backend side of things, by exposing the original, unlegalized argument type to CC lowering. This allowed cleaning up lots of target-specific hacks, like MIPS’ hardcoded list of fp128 libcalls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ConstantInt assertions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The previous year, I introduced an assertion when constructing arbitrary-precision integers (APInts) from &lt;code&gt;uint64_t&lt;/code&gt;, which ensures that the value actually is an N-bit signed/unsigned integer. The purpose of this assertion is to avoid miscompiles due to incorrectly specified signedness, which only manifests for large integers (with more than 64 bits).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back then, I excluded the &lt;code&gt;ConstantInt::get()&lt;/code&gt; constructor from this assertion to reduce the (already very large) scope of the work. I ended up regretting that when I hit a SelectOptimize miscompile, which is caused by precisely the problem this assertion is supposed to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was enough motivation to extend the assertion to &lt;code&gt;ConstantInt::get()&lt;/code&gt;. Once again, this required substantial work to fix existing issues (most of which were harmless, but I’ve caught at least two more miscompiles along the way).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compilation-time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have done little compile-time work this year, and there hasn’t been much activity from other people either. Here’s how compile-time developed over the course of 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have only included two configurations in the graph, because it is getting quite cluttered otherwise. Historically, I have only been tracking compile-times on x86, but have added two AArch64 configurations this year. An interesting takeaway from this is that compilation for AArch64 is around 10-20% slower, depending on configuration. For unoptimized builds, this is due to use of GlobalISel instead of FastISel. For optimized builds, use of alias analysis during codegen is a significant factor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of optimizations, I’ve implemented an improvement to SCCP worklist management (~0.25% improvement), which reduces the number of times instructions are visited during sparse conditional constant propagation. I’ve introduced a getBaseObjectSize() function (~0.35% improvement) to avoid use of expensive &lt;code&gt;__builtin_object_size&lt;/code&gt; machinery where it is not needed. I’ve also specialized calculation of type allocation sizes (~0.25% improvement) to reduce redundant operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d also like to highlight two changes from other contributors. One was to optimize debug linetable emission, by avoiding the creation of unnecessary fragments. This improved debug builds by ~1%. Another was to change the representation of nested name specifiers in the Clang AST. I have no idea what this is doing, but it improved Clang build time by ~2.6%, so this has a big impact on C++ heavy projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m especially happy about the Clang change, as Clang is our main source of unmitigated compile-time regressions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Optimizations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t tend to do much direct optimization work: If the optimization does not require significant IR or infrastructure changes, we have plenty of other people who can work on it. But sometimes I can’t resist, so here are a couple of the more interesting optimizations I worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve implemented a store merge optimization, which combines multiple stores into a single larger store. LLVM already had some support for this in the backend, but it was rather hit and miss. The reason I worked on this is that someone on Reddit shared an example where Rust’s GCC backend actually produced better code than the LLVM backend, which is an injustice I just could not let stand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve enabled the use of PredicateInfo1 in non-inter-procedural SCCP (sparse conditional constant propagation). This enables reliable optimization based on constant ranges implied by branches and assumptions. Previously we only handled this during inter-procedural SCCP, which runs very early, and CVP (correlated value propagation), which is based on LVI (lazy value info) and has problems dealing with loops2. The main work here went into speeding up PredicateInfo, but we still had to eat a ~0.1% compile-time regression in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ve implemented a pass to drop assumes that are unlikely to be useful anymore. This partially addresses a recurring problem where adding more assumes degrades optimization quality. This is just a starting point, we should likely be dropping assumes with various degrees of aggressiveness at multiple pipeline positions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rust&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, I’ve updated Rust to use LLVM 20 and then LLVM 21. Similar to all recent updates, this came with compile-time improvements (LLVM 20, LLVM 21).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both updates went relatively smoothly. LLVM 21 ran into a BOLT instrumentation miscompile that defied local reproduction, but luckily an update of the host toolchain fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these updates we were able to use a number of new LLVM features, some of which were added specifically for use by Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most significant is the use of read-only captures for non-mutable references. This lets LLVM know that not only can’t the function modify the memory, but it also can’t be modified through captured pointers after the call. This further increases the reliability of memory optimizations in Rust relative to C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another is the use of the &lt;code&gt;alloc-variant-zeroed&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which enables optimization of &lt;code&gt;__rust_alloc&lt;/code&gt; + memset zero to &lt;code&gt;__rust_alloc_zeroed&lt;/code&gt;. This ended up running into some LTO issues that required follow-up changes to fix attribute emission for allocator definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also marking by value arguments as &lt;code&gt;dead_on_return&lt;/code&gt; now, and using getelementptr nuw for pointer arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Packaging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LLVM team at Red Hat has shared responsibility for packaging LLVM on Fedora, CentOS Stream, and RHEL. Most of the work happens as part of round-robin maintenance of daily3 snapshot builds. In theory, snapshot builds ensure that shipping a new major version is as simple as incrementing a version number. In practice, it never works out quite that easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the previous year, we had already started using a monolithic build for the core llvm packages. This year, the mlir, polly, bolt, libcxx and flang builds were also merged into the monolithic build, which means that we only build libclc separately now. Additionally, the builds now use PGO. These improvements were made by my colleague kwk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One change that I worked on, and which ended up as a big failure, was to increase the consistency between our main llvm package, and the llvmNN compatibility packages we provide for older versions. The compatibility packages install LLVM inside a prefixed path like &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib64/llvmNN&lt;/code&gt;, while the main package is installed to the usual system paths. The idea was that we should always install to the prefixed path, and symlink from the system path. That way, the main package could be used the same as a compatibility package, avoiding the need for adjustments when switching between them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first issue this ran into is that RPM does not support replacing a directory with a symlink during upgrades. There are documented workarounds using pretrans scriptlets, but those don’t fully work.4 In the end we had to symlink individual files instead of symlinking entire directories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second issue only became apparent much later, after this change had already shipped: It was no longer possible to install the 32-bit and 64-bit packages of LLVM at the same time (known as the “multilib” configuration). While the prefixed path for both packages is different, they both install symlinks in the same system paths, and once again, RPM can’t deal with that. RPM has special “file color” support that lets 64-bit files win over 32-bit ones, but of course it only works for ELF files, not for symlinks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I explored lots of options for fixing this, but everything ended up running into one missing RPM feature or another. In the end, I ended up inverting the symlink direction (making the version-prefixed paths point to the system path). The lesson learned here is that if you use RPM, you should avoid symlinks like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LLVM area team and project council&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, LLVM adopted a new governance process, which includes elected area teams. Together with fhahn and arsenm, I have been elected to the LLVM area team. The LLVM area team holds a meeting every two weeks to discuss pending RFCs. (The meetings are public, but usually it’s just us three.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our approach has generally been hands-off. We have explicitly approved some RFCs where people expressed uncertainty, but usually our only involvement has been to provide additional comments on RFCs with insufficient engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike some other areas, I believe we had very few controversial proposals/discussions. One of them is an extensive discussion on floating-point min/max semantics, which has only been resolved recently. The other one was on delinearization challenges, but that was more a generic complaint than a specific proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As chair of the LLVM area team, I also participate in the project council. This is kind of the opposite of the area team, in that nearly all topics that reach the project council are controversial – things like the AI policy, the mandatory pull request proposal, and the sframe upstreaming. While progress has been made, we haven’t reached final resolutions on many of these topics yet. The AI policy is now live though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Other&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the year, we formed the formal specification working group, which aims to close long standing correctness gaps in LLVM, especially relating to the provenance model. I’ve participated in various early discussions for this group and wrote up a draft provenance model for LLVM. The current focus of the group is the byte type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve deprecated the global context in the LLVM C API, a common footgun. I’ve changed the representation of alignment in masked memory intrinsics. I’ve simplified the in-memory blockaddress representation and proposed more significant changes for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I reviewed approximately 2500 pull requests last year. Unfortunately, this is nowhere near enough to keep up with my review queue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;PredicateInfo performs SSA-renaming based on branch conditions and assumes. This results in something akin to SSI (static single information) form, and allows standard sparse dataflow propagation to make use of them. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LVI is a shared analysis between JumpThreading and CVP. Because JumpThreading performs pervasive control-flow changes, it cannot preserve the dominator tree. As such, LVI also can’t use the dominator tree. This results in a purely recursive analysis, which conservatively aborts on cycles, even if there is a common dominating condition. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In practice, we produce successful builds across all architectures and operating systems much less often than daily. Something always breaks. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They solve the upgrade problem, but not the downgrade problem, so still fail rpmdeplint. And handling downgrades requires a change to previous versions of the package. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Networks</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/kimwolf-botnet-lurking-in-corporate-govt-networks/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="b73d9b15983171c3"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new Internet-of-Things (IoT) botnet called Kimwolf has spread to more than 2 million devices, forcing infected systems to participate in massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay other malicious and abusive Internet traffic. Kimwolf’s ability to scan the local networks of compromised systems for other IoT devices to infect makes it a sobering threat to organizations, and new research reveals Kimwolf is surprisingly prevalent in government and corporate networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kimwolf grew rapidly in the waning months of 2025 by tricking various “residential proxy” services into relaying malicious commands to devices on the local networks of those proxy endpoints. Residential proxies are sold as a way to anonymize and localize one’s Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their Internet activity through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The malware that turns one’s Internet connection into a proxy node is often quietly bundled with various mobile apps and games, and it typically forces the infected device to relay malicious and abusive traffic — including ad fraud, account takeover attempts, and mass content-scraping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kimwolf mainly targeted proxies from IPIDEA, a Chinese service that has millions of proxy endpoints for rent on any given week. The Kimwolf operators discovered they could forward malicious commands to the internal networks of IPIDEA proxy endpoints, and then programmatically scan for and infect other vulnerable devices on each endpoint’s local network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the systems compromised through Kimwolf’s local network scanning have been unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. These are typically Android Open Source Project devices — not Android TV OS devices or Play Protect certified Android devices — and they are generally marketed as a way to watch unlimited (read:pirated) video content from popular subscription streaming services for a one-time fee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, a great many of these TV boxes ship to consumers with residential proxy software pre-installed. What’s more, they have no real security or authentication built-in: If you can communicate directly with the TV box, you can also easily compromise it with malware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While IPIDEA and other affected proxy providers recently have taken steps to block threats like Kimwolf from going upstream into their endpoints (reportedly with varying degrees of success), the Kimwolf malware remains on millions of infected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kimwolf’s close association with residential proxy networks and compromised Android TV boxes might suggest we’d find relatively few infections on corporate networks. However, the security firm Infoblox said a recent review of its customer traffic found nearly 25 percent of them made a query to a Kimwolf-related domain name since October 1, 2025, when the botnet first showed signs of life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infoblox found the affected customers are based all over the world and in a wide range of industry verticals, from education and healthcare to government and finance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“To be clear, this suggests that nearly 25% of customers had at least one device that was an endpoint in a residential proxy service targeted by Kimwolf operators,” Infoblox explained. “Such a device, maybe a phone or a laptop, was essentially co-opted by the threat actor to probe the local network for vulnerable devices. A query means a scan was made, not that new devices were compromised. Lateral movement would fail if there were no vulnerable devices to be found or if the DNS resolution was blocked.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to disclose on January 2 the unique methods Kimwolf uses to spread, found proxy endpoints from IPIDEA were present in alarming numbers at government and academic institutions worldwide. Synthient said it spied at least 33,000 affected Internet addresses at universities and colleges, and nearly 8,000 IPIDEA proxies within various U.S. and foreign government networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a webinar on January 16, experts at the proxy tracking service Spur profiled Internet addresses associated with IPIDEA and 10 other proxy services that were thought to be vulnerable to Kimwolf’s tricks. Spur found residential proxies in nearly 300 government owned and operated networks, 318 utility companies, 166 healthcare companies or hospitals, and 141 companies in banking and finance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I looked at the 298 [government] owned and operated [networks], and so many of them were DoD [U.S. Department of Defense], which is kind of terrifying that DoD has IPIDEA and these other proxy services located inside of it,” Spur Co-Founder Riley Kilmer said. “I don’t know how these enterprises have these networks set up. It could be that [infected devices] are segregated on the network, that even if you had local access it doesn’t really mean much. However, it’s something to be aware of. If a device goes in, anything that device has access to the proxy would have access to.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kilmer said Kimwolf demonstrates how a single residential proxy infection can quickly lead to bigger problems for organizations that are harboring unsecured devices behind their firewalls, noting that proxy services present a potentially simple way for attackers to probe other devices on the local network of a targeted organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you know you have [proxy] infections that are located in a company, you can chose that [network] to come out of and then locally pivot,” Kilmer said. “If you have an idea of where to start or look, now you have a foothold in a company or an enterprise based on just that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the third story in our series on the Kimwolf botnet. Next week, we’ll shed light on the myriad China-based individuals and companies connected to the Badbox 2.0 botnet, the collective name given to a vast number of Android TV streaming box models that ship with no discernible security or authentication built-in, and with residential proxy malware pre-installed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(originally published on my old blog)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been learning Rust lately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust is one of the most loved languages out there, is fast, and has an amazing community. Rust invented the concept of ownership as a solution memory management issues without resorting to something slower like Garbage Collection or Reference Counting. But, when you don’t need to be quite as low level, it gives you utilities such as &lt;code&gt;Rc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Cow&lt;/code&gt; to do reference counting and “clone-on-right” in your code. And, when you need to go lower-level still, you can use the &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; system and access raw C pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust also has a bunch of awesome features from functional languages like tagged enums, match expressions, first class functions and a powerful type system with generics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust has an LLVM-based compiler which lets it compile to native code and WASM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve also been doing a bit of Swift programming for a couple of years now. And the more I learn Rust, the more I see a reflection of Swift. (I know that Swift stole a lot of ideas from Rust, I’m talking about my own perspective here).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift, too, has awesome features from functional languages like tagged enums, match expressions and first-class functions. It too has a very powerful type system with generics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift too gives you complete type-safety without a garbage collector. By default, everything is a value type with “copy-on-write” semantics. But when you need extra speed you can opt into an ownership system and “move” values to avoid copying. And if you need to go even lower level, you can use the unsafe system and access raw C pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift has an LLVM-based compiler which lets it compile to native code and WASM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Deja Vu?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re probably feeling like you just read the same paragraphs twice. This is no accident. Swift is extremely similar to Rust and has most of the same feature-set. But there is a very big difference is perspective. If you consider the default memory model, this will start to make a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Rust is bottom-up, Swift is top-down.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust is a low-level systems language at heart, but it gives you the tools to go higher level. Swift starts at a high level and gives you the ability to go low-level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most obvious example of this is the memory management model. Swift use value-types by default with &lt;code&gt;copy-on-write&lt;/code&gt; semantics. This is the equivalent of using &lt;code&gt;Cow&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for all your values in Rust. But defaults matter. Rust makes it easy to use “moved” and “borrowed” values but requires extra ceremony to use &lt;code&gt;Cow&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; values as you need to “unwrap” them &lt;code&gt;.as_mutable()&lt;/code&gt; to actually use the value within. Swift makes these Copy-on-Write values easy to use and instead requires extra ceremony to use borrowing and moving instead. Rust is faster by default, Swift is simpler and easier by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Swift takes Rust’s ideas and hides them in C-like syntax.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift’s syntax is a masterclass in taking awesome functional language concepts and hiding them in C-like syntax to trick the developers into accepting them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; statements. This is what a match statement looks like in Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how that same code would be written in Swift:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift doesn’t have a &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; statement or expression. It has a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement that developers are already familiar with. Except this &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement is actually not a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement at all. It’s an expression. It doesn’t “fallthrough”. It does pattern matching. It’s just a &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; expression with a different name and syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, Swift treats &lt;code&gt;enums&lt;/code&gt; as more than just types and lets you put methods directly on it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;#Optional Types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust doesn’t have &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, but it does have &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;. Swift has a &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;, but it’s really just a &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; in hiding. Instead of an &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, Swift let’s you use &lt;code&gt;T?&lt;/code&gt;, but the compiler still forces you to check that the value is not &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; before you can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You get the same safety with more convenience since you can do this in Swift with an optional type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, you’re not forced to wrap every value with a &lt;code&gt;Some(val)&lt;/code&gt; before returning it. The Swift compiler takes care of that for you. A &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; will transparently be converted into a &lt;code&gt;T?&lt;/code&gt; when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;#Error Handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust doesn’t have &lt;code&gt;try-catch&lt;/code&gt;. Instead it has a &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; type which contains the success and error types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift doesn’t have a &lt;code&gt;try-catch&lt;/code&gt; either, but it does have &lt;code&gt;do-catch&lt;/code&gt; and you have to use &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; before calling a function that could throw. Again, this is just deception for those developers coming from C-like languages. Swift’s error handling works exactly like Rust’s behind the scenes, but it is hidden in a clever, familiar syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very similar to how Rust let’s you use &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; at the end of statements to automatically forward errors, but you don’t have to wrap your success values in &lt;code&gt;Ok()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Rust’s compiler catches problems. Swift’s compiler solves some of them&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many common problems that Rust’s compiler will catch at compile time and even suggest solutions for you. The example that portrays this well is self-referencing enums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider an enum that represents a tree. Since, it is a recursive type, Rust will force you to use something like &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for referencing a type within itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(You could also us &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;Vec&amp;lt;TreeNode&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes the problem explicit and forces you to deal with it directly. Swift is a little more, automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: that you still have to annotate this &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;indirect&lt;/code&gt; keyword to indicate that it is recursive. But once you’ve done that, Swift’s compiler takes care of the rest. You don’t have to think about &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Rc&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The values just work normally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Swift is less “pure”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift was designed to replace Objective-C and needed to be able to interface with existing code. So, it has made a lot of pragmatic choices that makes it a much less “pure” and “minimalist” language. Swift is a pretty big language compared to Rust and has many more features built-in. However, Swift is designed with “progressive disclosure” in mind which means that just as soon as you think you’ve learned the language a little more of the iceberg pops out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are just some of the language features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Classes / Inhertence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;async-await&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;async-sequences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;actors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;getters and setters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lazy properties&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;property wrappers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Result Builders (for building tree-like structures. e.g. HTML / SwiftUI)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Convenience has its costs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift is a far easier language to get started and productive with. The syntax is more familiar and a lot more is done for you automatically. But this really just makes Swift a higher-level language and it comes with the same tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, a Rust program is much faster than a Swift program. This is because Rust is fast by default, and lets you be slow, while Swift is easy by default and lets you be fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on this, I would say both languages have their uses. Rust is better for systems and embedded programming. It’s better for writing compilers and browser engines (Servo) and it’s better for writing entire operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift is better for writing UI and servers and some parts of compilers and operating systems. Over time I expect to see the overlap get bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#The “cross-platform” problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a perception that Swift is only a good language for Apple platforms. While this was once true, this is no longer the case and Swift is becoming increasingly a good cross-platform language. Hell, Swift even compiles to wasm, and the forks made by the swift-wasm team were merged back into Swift core earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift on Windows is being used by The Browser Company to share code and bring the Arc browser to windows. Swift on Linux has long been supported by Apple themselves in order to push “Swift on Server”. Apple is directly sponsoring the Swift on Server conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year Embedded Swift was also announced which is already being used on small devices like the Panic Playdate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift website has been highlighting many of these projects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The browser company says that Interoperability is Swift’s super power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the Swift project has been trying make working with Swift a great experience outside of XCode with projects like an open source LSP and funding the the VSCode extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Swift is not a perfect language.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compile times are (like Rust) quite bad. There is some amount of feature creep and the language is larger than it should be. Not all syntax feels familiar. The package ecosystem isn’t nearly as rich as Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the “Swift is only for Apple platforms” is an old and tired cliche at this point. Swift is already a cross-platform, ABI-stable language with no GC, automatic Reference Counting and the option to opt into ownership for even more performance. Swift packages increasingly work on Linux. Foundation was ported to Swift, open sourced and made open source. It’s still early days for Swift as a good, more convenient, Rust alternative for cross-platform development, but it is here now. It’s no longer a future to wait for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
