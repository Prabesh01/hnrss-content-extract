    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malicious versions of the &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; package, as well as some supporting plugin packages, were published to npm, containing code that scans the file system, collects credentials, and posts them to GitHub as a repo under user's accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Affected Versions of &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These versions have since been removed from NPM as of 6:20 AM EDT&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attack Vector&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Vulnerable Workflow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The root cause the introduction of a vulnerable workflow which contained the possibility for injecting executable code. The vulnerable workflow was reverted in &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; almost immediately after the team learned it could have been malicious. However, this proved to be inadequate to address the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workflow contained the 2 issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Bash Injection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;      - name: Create PR message file
        run: |
          mkdir -p /tmp
          cat &amp;gt; /tmp/pr-message.txt &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 'EOF'
          ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intention of these lines was to write pull request titles and bodies to a file which would then be validated via our commit format checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if a PR was opened with a title such as &lt;code&gt;$(echo "You've been compromised")&lt;/code&gt; the code would be executed within the workflow. We understood this once it was reported but we did not fully understand how this would compromise any secrets because the PR title validation workflow itself did not have access to any secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Elevated Permissions via &lt;code&gt;pull_request_target&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pull_request_target&lt;/code&gt; trigger (Github Docs) was used as a way to trigger the action to run whenever a PR was created or modified. However, what was missed is the warning that this trigger, unlike the standard &lt;code&gt;pull_request&lt;/code&gt; trigger, runs workflows with elevated permissions including a &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; which has read/write repository permission. Furthermore, the workflows are executed on the target repo of the PR (&lt;code&gt;nrwl/nx&lt;/code&gt;) which means that the &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; had permissions for the &lt;code&gt;nrwl/nx&lt;/code&gt; repo. In addition, the workflow is run using the version of the workflow available on the target branch which is not necessarily &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;. We believe that the PR was made targeting an outdated branch which still contained the vulnerable workflow despite the fact that the vulnerable workflow was removed from &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: While the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;had read/write capabilities. The&lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;branch and other important branches have Branch Protection rules enabled so the vulnerable workflow could not have written directly to&lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; from this workflow was utilized to trigger another workflow, the &lt;code&gt;publish.yml&lt;/code&gt; workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How the NPM token was compromised&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Up until this point, the team believed that although the PR validation workflow was vulnerable, it didn't contain any secrets. The vulnerable pipeline was just a means to trigger our &lt;code&gt;publish.yml&lt;/code&gt; pipeline which does indeed have the npm token which was used to publish the malicious versions of Nx.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;publish.yml&lt;/code&gt; pipeline, is our most permissive pipeline. It is responsible for publishing the Nx packages and therefore has access to the npm token via a Github Secret. As such, we took great care at least within the pipeline itself that ONLY our team was able to utilize the pipeline. As recommended, our github secrets are only accessible within pipelines triggered on &lt;code&gt;nrwl/nx&lt;/code&gt; and they are not accessible from any forks keeping it safe from external contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, because of the elevated permissions from the PR validation workflow, the &lt;code&gt;publish.yml&lt;/code&gt; workflow was triggered to run on the &lt;code&gt;nrwl/nx&lt;/code&gt; repo. Additional changes were made in the malicious commit which altered the behavior of the &lt;code&gt;publish.yml&lt;/code&gt; pipeline to send the npm token to a webhook. As part of the bash injection, the PR validation workflows triggered a run of the &lt;code&gt;publish.yml&lt;/code&gt; with this malicious commit and sent our npm token to an unfamiliar webhook. We believe this is how the user got a hold of the NPM token used to publish the malicious versions of Nx.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The &lt;code&gt;publish.yml&lt;/code&gt;  workflow did not publish packages in this incident but was the means to obtain the NPM token.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Malicious Behavior&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Credentials published as a Github repo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compromised package contained a &lt;code&gt;postinstall&lt;/code&gt; script that scanned user's file system for text files, collected paths, and credentials upon installing the package. This information was then posted as an encoded string to a github repo under the user's Github account. The Github repo would be posted with a name which contains &lt;code&gt;s1ngularity-repository&lt;/code&gt;. Github has since started to deactivate or archive these repos on their end. If you see that you have this repo, even though it may be archived now, at one point it was likely public meaning credentials in there could have been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Modification to &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The malicious &lt;code&gt;postinstall&lt;/code&gt; script also modified the &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; which are run whenever a terminal is launched to include &lt;code&gt;sudo shutdown -h 0&lt;/code&gt; which prompt users for their system password and if provided, would shutdown the machine immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How the &lt;code&gt;postinstall&lt;/code&gt; may be triggered&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most obvious way the &lt;code&gt;postinstall&lt;/code&gt; is triggered is manually running &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;pnpm install&lt;/code&gt; in a repo with the compromised version in the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, there are many less obvious ways NPM modules could get installed. Transitive dependencies, AI agents, editors, other editor extensions, other scripts are the first that come to mind but there are many many less obvious reasons why NPM modules might get installed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some users reported to the team that despite not having any workspaces which utilized Nx, they found that they had been affected. The team dug into how this was possible and found that Nx Console, our IDE extension, installs the &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; version of &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; to check the latest version of Nx. Because this installed &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt;, the malicious &lt;code&gt;postinstall&lt;/code&gt; was effectively triggered by opening an editor with the Nx Console extension. So, if you have the Nx Console extension installed in your editor and launched it while the malicious versions of &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; were tagged at &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; (between August 26th 6:37 PM - 10:44 PM EDT) you may have been compromised as well. Best to check if a Github repo was created on your account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not malicious behavior on its own but, a new Nx Console version has been released which no longer does this check. Again, this is just one of the many ways which NPM modules could be installed without being intentionally triggered by the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Timeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the following times are in EDT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August 21, 2025 - Introduction of the vulnerability&lt;lb/&gt; 4:31 PM - The team merged a PR which introduced a Github Actions workflow with an injection vulnerability which allowed execution of arbitrary bash commands.&lt;lb/&gt; 10:48 PM - A post was made to X (formally Twitter) that this workflow contained an injection exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August 22, 2025 - Inadequate resolution of the vulnerability&lt;lb/&gt; 3:17 PM - The team noticed the X post and began to investigate it internally.&lt;lb/&gt; 3:45 PM - After a cursory review and to be abundantly cautious, the vulnerable workflow was reverted which we believed at the time would prevent the vulnerable pipeline from being used categorically. Later, we discovered that the vulnerable pipeline could still indeed be triggered.&lt;lb/&gt; 3:52 PM - The team enabled CodeQL to the Nx repo and it identified no Critical vulnerabilities. This will catch similar vulnerabilities in PRs before they are merged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August 24, 2025 - Exploitation of the vulnerability&lt;lb/&gt; 4:50 PM - A commit was made on a fork of &lt;code&gt;nrwl/nx&lt;/code&gt; which showed signs of posting the NPM token to a webhook which the attacker likely received it.&lt;lb/&gt; 5:04 PM - Retroactively (we were not aware of this event until later), from our Github audit logs, we saw a PR was created from a fork to the &lt;code&gt;nrwl/nx&lt;/code&gt; repo with the malicious commit which triggers the PR validation workflow with a PR title which injects and executes malicious code. The PR has since been deleted and we cannot access it.&lt;lb/&gt; 5:11 PM - Again retroactively (we were not aware of this event until later), from our Github audit logs, we saw a &lt;code&gt;publish.yml&lt;/code&gt; workflow, a different workflow, was deleted. The workflow again utilized the malicious commit from a fork of the Nx repo. We believe that this &lt;code&gt;publish.yml&lt;/code&gt; workflow was triggered by the PR validation workflow stemming from the PR creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August 26, 2025 - Escalation of the vulnerability and first response&lt;lb/&gt; 6:32 PM - v21.5.0 of &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@nx/devkit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@nx/js&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@nx/workspace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@nx/node&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@nx/eslint&lt;/code&gt; was published, as well as v3.2.0 of &lt;code&gt;@nx/key&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@nx/enterprise-cloud&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; 6:39 PM - v20.9.0 of &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@nx/devkit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@nx/js&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@nx/workspace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@nx/node&lt;/code&gt; was published&lt;lb/&gt; 7:54 PM - v20.10.0 of only &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; was published&lt;lb/&gt; 7:54 PM - v21.6.0 of only &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; was published&lt;lb/&gt; 8:16 PM - v20.11.0 of only &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; was published&lt;lb/&gt; 8:17 PM - v21.7.0 of only &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; was published&lt;lb/&gt; 8:30 PM - A GitHub issue was posted alerting the team of the issue.&lt;lb/&gt; 8:33 PM - Another GitHub issue was posted which was closed in favor of the first issue.&lt;lb/&gt; 8:37 PM - v21.8.0 of only &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; was published&lt;lb/&gt; 8:37 PM - v20.12.0 of only &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; was published&lt;lb/&gt; 9:54 PM - A GitHub user reported the issue to NPM support.&lt;lb/&gt; 9:58 PM - A member of the team noticed the GitHub issue and posted it on Slack. Other members started to get involved and tried to escalate with the token owner and the owner of nrwl org.&lt;lb/&gt; 10:44 PM - NPM removed the affected versions and all publish tokens from all users from the registry, preventing any further publishes to any &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; or related packages&lt;lb/&gt; 11:57 PM - All NPM tokens with permissions for publishing were revoked preventing further malicious versions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August 27, 2025 - Remediation and further investigation&lt;lb/&gt; 1:53 AM - This security advisory was posted.&lt;lb/&gt; 2:32 AM - The team began to notify affected users and our clients with a way to receive aid with remediating their impact.&lt;lb/&gt; 3:33 AM - The team received reports that the malicious behavior was more extensive than initially realized and identified that Nx Console triggered an install of the &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; version of &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;lb/&gt; 5:05 AM - Github started making the repositories private somehow so that they do not show up in the search&lt;lb/&gt; 6:20 AM - NPM removed affected versions of other identified packages&lt;lb/&gt; 8:33 AM - A new version of Nx Console was released which no longer installs the &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; version of &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;lb/&gt; 11:57 AM - All NPM packages under Nx (affected or not) have been set to require 2FA and CANNOT be published with npm tokens any longer. All NPM packages have also been changed to use the new Trusted Publisher mechanism which does not utilize npm tokens&lt;lb/&gt; 1:23 PM - The team was notified of the malicious commit which seemed suspicious and aligned with the incident&lt;lb/&gt; 1:55 PM - The malicious commit was linked to the workflows triggered days earlier via the Github audit logs&lt;lb/&gt; 2:50 PM - The team successfully reproduced how the attack was done involving outdated PR branches being the remaining avenue how the vulnerable pipeline continued to be utilized.&lt;lb/&gt; 3:14 PM -All outdated branches on &lt;code&gt;nrwl/nx&lt;/code&gt; were rebased removing the vulnerable pipeline from being possibly utilized.&lt;lb/&gt; 3:28 PM - The team has temporarily also added additional restrictions where the team will have to approve pipelines to be executed on PRs from external contributors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Immediate Actions Required&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;For all users, check if you were impacted&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check this https://github.com/[GithubSlug]?tab=repositories&amp;amp;q=s1ngularity-repository to see if your a repo was published to your Github account.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download the file in the repo for your own records.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then, remove the repo from GitHub.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;E-mail security@nrwl.io and we will instruct you on how to decode the file so you are aware what information was leaked&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotate your credentials and tokens on all of your accounts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;For all users, stop using the malicious versions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Check if the version of nx you are using was a malicious version
npm ls nx

# If using affected versions, update immediately:
npm uninstall nx &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm install nx@latest

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;For Users Who were compromised:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refer to the section above to see if you were compromised. If so, do the following.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotate npm tokens: Visit https://www.npmjs.com/ and rotate your tokens.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotate Github Tokens: Visit https://www.github.com/ and rotate your tokens.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change Github Credentials: Change passwords for Github&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change your passwords for any other services you use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check your &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;files for any unfamiliar lines and remove them.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preventative measures implemented before the incident&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had several preventative measures in place before the incident some of which include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2FA Enforcement: All maintainers under the nrwl org had to have 2FA enabled on their accounts. (2FA was not required to publish but it was required to login to the accounts)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Provenance was attached to recent versions of Nx &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This does not prevent installing the package but it did provide a way to verify the integrity of new versions of &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This does not prevent installing the package but it did provide a way to verify the integrity of new versions of &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Remediation and Preventative Measures Taken&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have taken the following actions to remediate this issue, prevent further issues, also ensure validity of future packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deprecated all malicious package versions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Restored &lt;code&gt;21.4.1&lt;/code&gt;(a valid version) as&lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Revoked possibly compromised personal account access, even though single compromised token seems most likely at this time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotated all team NPM and GitHub tokens&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit GitHub and NPM activities across the organization for suspicious activities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Updated Publish access for &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt;to require 2FA or automation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Posted this advisory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; The &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt;package now requires Trusted Providers methodology of publishing via our&lt;code&gt;.github/publish.yml&lt;/code&gt;workflow in the&lt;code&gt;nrwl/nx&lt;/code&gt;repo.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remove NPM tokens from our pipeline now that we're using Trusted Providers on NPM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; All NPM packages under Nx (the company) including &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt;have been set to require 2FA and cannot be published with access tokens&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; All Github secrets on the &lt;code&gt;nrwl/nx&lt;/code&gt;repo have been rotated. If any other secrets were compromised, they are no longer valid.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We are continuing to assess how if any other malicious activity was done with the other secrets we have in Github but have not found any further malicious activity at this time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; All branches containing the vulnerable pipeline on &lt;code&gt;nrwl/nx&lt;/code&gt;have been updated to not have the vulnerable pipeline.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The nx repo now also will require team members to approve workflows triggered by external contributors. This will block workflows unknown to us from slipping through.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CodeQL was enabled in the Nx repo. This will catch similar vulnerabilities in PRs before they are merged.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; We have added &lt;code&gt;SECURITY.md&lt;/code&gt;instructions detailing the proper way to notify us privately about future security issues in Nx.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This advisory will be updated when there is more information available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with the preventative measures we have now put in place, the team has learned many valuable lessons from this incident. The team will soon retrospect on this incident, formulate the lessons we have learned, and share those with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Bug&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Body&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, Github has been getting slower and slower on Safari. It has now reached a point where it is unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Displaying any pull request with more than a thousand lines changed or even browsing any file with a thousand or more lines of code is fully broken.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;What happens:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;I have a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a 16-cores Apple M4 Max and 48GB of RAM, using it plugged-in with performance mode enabled. It's one of the most powerful laptops on the market today. Github is the only website I know that doesn't run on it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This is Safari specific, Google Chrome on the same machine performs way better (although it still struggles with very large pull requests). I'm using Safari 18.6 (20621.3.11.11.3) on macOS Sequoia 15.6 with no extensions installed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Having the same issue, where GitHub got slower and slower in safari.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For bigger PRs I can't edit anything or press on any buttons. Seems like such a big page breaks something?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;I also disabled all content blockers and plugins for GitHub, didn't change anything :/&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(using an M3 Pro Mac with 18GB Ram)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Same here.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Even small PRs I can't do anything. Adding reviewers, adding labels, etc... every action on the page takes many seconds. The page often locks up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This wasnt an issue a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Same - I don't know what's driving the engineering behind this, but it is embarrassing. It's just getting slower and slower for no appreciable benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;AFAICT this extends to all API actions triggered by the UI. Case in point, I just went to subscribe to this issue in Safari, and it took more than 20 seconds before the button state switched to "Unsubscribe". I'm now writing this comment in Chrome... 👎&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Our team has noticed this as well, very sluggish UI in general. Especially noticeable on pull requests and autocomplete boxes like &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;It only took about a year to go from visibly slow but usable to now annoying and completely unusable. I had to install a 3rd-party app on my Mac to automatically open all GitHub URLs in Chrome. ¯_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;It's not uncommon for me to do the following things opening a PR:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;I do this several times a day and within the last few weeks the page will lock up every time. Sometimes I'll refresh the browser and even that takes a while to perform. Historically I've had no issues with this in Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;"The wiki page took too long to render."&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2600 characters in 10 seconds should be doable despite unicode?&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;I now use https://graphite.dev instead of GitHub because their UI works fine in Safari, they support stacked PRs, and many features GitHub does not, such as actually scrolling me to the comment I was linked to 😮&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Might be a helpful workaround for anyone who uses Safari as their daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;And don't even think of trying to read the github website with a screen reader for accessibility for the visually impaired. If you don't run all javascript with a bleeding edge browser then there's no text to read at all. In this sense the github website has become extremely slow during the Microsoft ownership period: the text never shows up.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;I’m also seeing this slowdown quite a bit. For me it’s been noticeable on Safari for a long time, especially in PRs, but over the past few days the entire site feels sluggish as hell. Chrome is much better.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(For context: I was previously a PM at GitHub and often advocated for and discovered Safari bugs during my time there, so hopefully anyone on staff here who knows me will understand I’m not posting lightly!)&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;As a Safari-only user, I didn't know it was a problem only occurring on Safari. I'm not having problems on any other sites so it's probably GH.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;What's more interesting is that one of the top sites used by programmers is not testing one of the most common tasks on the website with one of the most common browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Hope it gets fixed soon. Any large PRs is unworkable with Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Browser native back button is broken on iOS safari too. When the one navigate source code usually it doesn’t do anything but change url. Hitting back several times with no effect and reloading page in disgust leading to jump to arbitrary url in history.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN, we’re Kyle, Jacob, and Tim. We’re building Bitrig (&lt;/p&gt;https://www.bitrig.app&lt;p&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitrig lets you create native Swift apps for your phone, on your phone, just by chatting with AI. It’s like Lovable for iPhone apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a video of Bitrig in action: https://youtu.be/CUlWhF3ERME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We created SwiftUI at Apple to help developers make better apps with less code. Bitrig lets anyone build at this level of polish. If you've thought about making an iPhone app, Bitrig is the easiest possible way to get started with Swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitrig uses Claude Sonnet 4.0 with a simple system prompt and tool definitions to generate native Swift code. Normally running this on an iPhone would require compiling and signing it with Xcode, and you can’t run Xcode on an iPhone. So we did something… creative. We wrote a custom Swift interpreter! Among other things this lets you instantly preview your app in Bitrig and share it with just a URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a paid Apple developer account, you can connect it with Bitrig. We’ll compile your app on our server and upload it to App Store Connect, so you can distribute it on TestFlight or the App Store. This last step also gives you a fully optimized build of your app that you can install right on your Home Screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think there’s something electric about building apps directly on your phone. We hope you give Bitrig a try!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re ingesting Apple’s SDK frameworks into Bitrig piece by piece. If you try to build something and hit a missing framework, let us know and we’ll prioritize adding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download Bitrig on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitrig/id6747835910&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Search Navigation: reach the 3rd occurrence with &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After completing the final level, a centered full-screen celebration overlay appears with a confetti animation and a Play Again button. Press Enter or click Play Again to restart at level 1.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Counts: prefix a number before commands (e.g., &lt;code&gt;3w&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;2dd&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;5x&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;5G&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Search: &lt;code&gt;/text&lt;/code&gt;forward,&lt;code&gt;?text&lt;/code&gt;backward;&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;next,&lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;previous&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Empty search query does nothing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No matches: status shows &lt;code&gt;0/0&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;do nothing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wrapping: &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;wrap around the buffer when reaching the ends.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Challenge Mode is a fast-paced game designed to test and improve your Vim command recall under time pressure. Users are presented with a series of command tasks to complete as quickly and accurately as possible. Each correctly executed command scores points, while speed and precision determine the final score. This mode offers an engaging way to sharpen your Vim skills by combining rapid-fire challenges with real-time feedback, making learning Vim commands both fun and effective. Try to beat your highest score and see how quickly you can master essential Vim commands!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each level defines a target cursor location, target text, or target content layout.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Validation is resilient to trailing spaces and blank lines where appropriate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You progress when the outcome matches the target; keystroke sequences themselves aren’t strictly enforced.&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports" than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. "So a lot of fast progress there."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, "internal barriers" and Google's culture after several recent rounds of layoffs, buyouts and reorganizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"When we look across our entire leadership population, that's mangers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company "to be more efficient as we scale up so we don't solve everything with headcount."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts "a little further." Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented "Voluntary Exit Program" offers. They've applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fiona Cicconi, Google's chief people officer, said at last week's meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This has been actually quite successful," she said, adding "I think we can continue it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pichai said the company executed the voluntary buyouts after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's a lot of work that's gone into implementing the VEP program, and I'm glad we've done it," Pichai said. "It gives people agency, and I'm glad to see it's worked out well."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Wanting a career break'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's actually quite interesting to see who's taking a VEP, and it's people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CNBC previously reported that the layoffs hurt morale as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet's shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to Meta's "recharge," a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that — resting and recharging," said Alexandra Maddison, Google's senior director of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We're very confident that our current offering is competitive," Maddison said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other executives jumped in to compare the two companies' benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I don't think they have a VEP at Meta by the way," Cicconi said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, "Should we incorporate all policies of Meta while we're at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Maybe I should try running the company with all of Meta's policies," he continued. "No, probably not."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within five days of ChatGPT’s release in 2022, the artificial intelligence chatbot gained more than a million users. Today, more than half of all adults under age 30 and nearly half of adults ages 30-49 say they’ve used it, according to Pew Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New research from Florida State University’s Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics, Department of Computer Science, and Department of Mathematics is revealing notable evidence that AI buzzwords overused by chat-based large language models aren’t just suggested on screens anymore — they’re frequently showing up in how people actually speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their work, “Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English,” is the first peer-reviewed research to analyze whether the conversational human language system is changing in the wake of the widespread adoption of chat-based large language models like ChatGPT. It was accepted into the eighth Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, hosted by the Association for the Advancement of AI and Association for Computing Machinery, which will be held in October. The study will be published in AIES Proceedings as part of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This research focuses on a central issue in the discourse surrounding AI and language: are these language changes happening because we’re using a tool and repeating what it suggested or is language changing because AI is influencing the human language system?” said assistant professor of computational linguistics and principal investigator Tom Juzek. “By analyzing lexical trends before and after ChatGPT was released in 2022, we found a convergence between human word choices and LLM-associated patterns with AI buzzwords.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While rapid increases in the use of certain words — like Omicron — do occur, these increases are typically due to real-world events. Recent large-scale upticks in the use of words like “delve” and “intricate” in certain fields, especially education and academic writing, are attributed to the widespread introduction of LLMs with a chat function, like ChatGPT, that overuses those buzzwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The changes we are seeing in spoken language are pretty remarkable, especially when compared to historical trends,” Juzek said. “What stands out is the breadth of change: so many words are showing notable increases over a relatively short period. Given that these are all words typically overused by AI, it seems plausible to conjecture a link.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Words including “surpass,” “boast,” “meticulous,” “strategically,” and “garner” have also seen considerable increases in usage since the release of ChatGPT. While these words are often used in a formal or academic tone, which makes them less common in unscripted, spoken language, researchers found that nearly three-quarters of these target words showed increased usage with some more than doubling in frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team, including Bryce Anderson, a rising senior majoring in computer science, and Riley Galpin, a rising junior double-majoring in computer science and pure mathematics, analyzed 22.1 million words from unscripted and spontaneous spoken language including conversational podcasts on science and technology. Post-ChatGPT, researchers noted a measurable increase in the use of AI-associated buzzwords but not their synonymous counterparts. For example, the AI buzzword “underscore” saw considerable increase in usage while its synonym “accentuate” did not. FSU researchers said this suggests we’re not just using AI; AI buzzwords are turning up in how people talk, raising concerns about a possible “seep-in effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Language is the most powerful medium of communication that humanity has and understanding how AI will affect this medium is fundamentally important and timely,” said Anderson, the paper’s lead author. “My motivation to pursue this research stems from seeing AI push the limits of what’s possible in major industries and realizing that this influence isn’t just limited to tool usage — it can condition societal aspects, including how we use language.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research builds upon the group’s previous research into the impact AI has on the domain of written scientific English, which revealed large-scale structural changes AI has had on scientific writing. Galpin presented the research on written language at the 38th International Florida AI Research Society Conference in May, and Anderson will join Juzek in presenting the team’s new research on spoken language at the AIES Conference in October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our research highlights many important ethical questions,” Galpin said. “With the ability of LLMs to influence human language comes larger questions about how model biases and misalignment, or differences in behavior in LLMs, may begin to influence human behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research was conducted as part of FSU’s Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, which provides high-achieving undergraduates an opportunity to explore their research interests alongside a faculty member.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I look forward to future research in this area,” Juzek said. “While this is a critical development in understanding AI’s role in language change, a big open question for future work is whether AI is amplifying conventional patterns of language change or directly driving them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The popularity of breathwork as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding. Breathwork practices that increase ventilatory rate or depth, facilitated by music, can evoke subjective experiential states analogous to altered states of consciousness (ASCs) evoked by psychedelic substances. These states include components such as euphoria, bliss, and perceptual differences. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the profound subjective effects of high ventilation breathwork (HVB) remain largely unknown and unexplored. In this study, we investigated the neurobiological substrates of ASCs induced by HVB in experienced practitioners. We demonstrate that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation and to haemodynamic alterations in cerebral perfusion within clusters spanning the left operculum/posterior insula and right amygdala/anterior hippocampus; regions implicated in respiratory interoceptive representation and the processing of emotional memories, respectively. These observed regional cerebral effects may underlie pivotal mental experiences that mediate positive therapeutic outcomes of HVB.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High ventilation breathwork (HVB) encompasses contemplative and therapeutic practices, including Conscious Connected Breathing or Holotropic Breathwork, in which a controlled pattern of volitional breathing increases the rate or depth of ventilation and is typically accompanied by evocative music. Despite their distinct historical roots and delivery modalities, these different HVB practices share a purported ability to elicit acute extraordinary alterations in subjective experience that closely resemble the qualia of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) induced by psychedelic substances [1–3]. Converging evidence demonstrates the potential value of psychedelic treatments for specific difficult-to-treat psychiatric and physiological conditions [4–7]. The induction of ASCs is suggested to be critical to the therapeutic action of psychedelic substances [8–10], for which HVB might therefore offer a non-pharmacological alternative, with fewer legal and ethical restrictions to large-scale adoption in clinical treatment. In line with this, the popularity of HVB as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding, indexed by an increased number of scientific investigations, see [11,12] for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The therapeutic potential of HVB practices is suggested by a long cultural tradition of use to relieve symptoms of psychological distress [11,13] and by emerging preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy from controlled trials in affective and trauma-related disorders [14]. Prolonged hyperventilation/HVB reportedly elicits a wide range of effects on subjective experience that include emotional and psychedelic-like phenomena (ASCs), which range from panic-like sensations to feelings of awe and dissociative symptoms [11]. The 5D-ASC questionnaire is popularly used in ASC research to retrospectively assess such states [15]. A key dimension of this scale is ‘Oceanic Boundlessness’ (OBN); a term coined by Freud in 1920 [16] which describes a set of related feelings including ‘spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity’ [17]. OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. However, the neurobiological mechanisms and subjective experience underlying ASCs induced by HVB have not been studied extensively and remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we characterised the subjective experience of HVB to capture the nature and intensity of evoked experiential phenomena. From these data, we aimed to assess whether these effects could be reliably reproduced in controlled experimental settings in comparison to a remote – and more ecologically valid – condition. These findings informed the choice of the ASC variable, OBN, which was ultimately selected as the most widely reported experiential phenomena to identify the critical neurobiological effects of HVB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we examined the effects of HVB performed by experienced breathwork practitioners in different experimental settings, and investigated peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning ASCs engendered by HVB. The neurobiological endpoints were selected based on well-characterised neurophysiological effects of hyperventilation (reviewed in [11]). Hyperventilation acutely reduces regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) through interacting effects of hypocapnia, cerebral alkalosis and hypoxia, resulting in transient perturbation of neurometabolic homeostasis. Further, hyperventilation evokes allostatic changes in action-ready bodily arousal, mediated via the autonomic nervous system via the dominance of sympathetic over parasympathetic drive to the heart and blood vessels. In characterising the neurobiological effects of HVB and associated ASCs, we therefore focused our measurements on two robust indices of neurometabolic and autonomic nervous control: rCBF and heart rate variability (HRV).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, no studies have previously reported the relationship between the intensity of ASCs and changes in rCBF induced by HVB practices. Since we could not base our prediction of the regional specificity of such correlations on previous knowledge, we preferred to adopt a whole brain voxelwise exploratory approach. Also, as observations reported on the effects of psychedelics on autonomic nervous system activity have been contrasting [18,19], we could not make precise predictions on the direction of association between HRV and ASCs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our study was designed to address different objectives through three inter-related experiments: (please see the methods for more details), in 1) HVB was conducted over an online video-conferencing platform with a breathwork facilitator (REMOTE setting). The aim was to characterise the subjective response to remote HVB in a home setting, and inform the choice of the ASC domain to be used as subjective endpoint. In 2), we used pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain during HVB to identify the relationship between neural haemodynamic effects of HVB and subjective measures (MRI setting). In 3) HVB was performed in a psychophysiology lab to characterise the relationship between the psychophysiological effects of HVB (autonomic alterations, see ‘psychophysiological session 3’ for more information) and subjective measures (LAB setting).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ethics statement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research was approved by the Research Governance and Ethics Committee (RGEC) in Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) as ERA/BSMS9AN4/2/2. Recruitment began on 24/11/2021 and ended on 03/03/2022. Participants provided written informed consent before participating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Participants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Physically and psychiatrically healthy participants aged 18–65 years old were recruited from the local area through advertisements and flyers distributed at breathwork events, in yoga/meditation centres, and on social media. Participants were eligible to take part if they had either 10 or more experiences of fast-paced breathwork or at least 6 months of any HVB practice (as defined in [11]). They were screened online for eligibility and excluded if they were pregnant, currently experiencing any psychiatric condition (assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to ensure absence of DSM-V listed disorders) [20]. Additional exclusion criteria included a history of epileptic seizures, panic disorder, or syncope in prior HVB, current neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, or cardiovascular disease, current pharmacological treatment, and contraindications to MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants and were financially compensated £10 per hour for their time and up to £10 in travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Breathwork modality and subjective measures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HVB consisted of cyclic breathing without pausing, accompanied by progressively evocative music. This aimed to reproduce the experience of Conscious Connected Breathing, a widely adopted HVB practice typically led by a trained breathwork facilitator. In the online experimental session, instructions were provided by a breathwork facilitator (DB) who hosted the group of online participants. For the LAB and MRI setting, pre-recorded instructions by the same facilitator were delivered to participants. Specific details on breathwork instructions are presented in the supplementary index (S1 Appendix).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Questionnaires&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-reported measures were consistent across the three conditions and administered online via Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) [21] within 30 minutes post-HVB. The selected questionnaires assessed: 1) Affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – Expanded Form, PANAS-X [22]); 2) Panic–like symptoms (Panic Symptoms List, PSL [23]), 3) Fear and discomfort (Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) [24]), and 4) Symptoms of ASCs (5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, 5D-ASC [15]).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-session questionnaires included the VAS (scored from “0 – no fear and discomfort” to “100 – complete fear and discomfort”) [24] and the PANAS-X, which measured affect using 60 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale from “1 – very slightly or not at all” to “5 – extremely” [25].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Post-session questionnaires included the VAS and PANAS-X again, as well as the 5D-ASC, which retrospectively assessed ASCs using 94 items rated via VAS [17]. Questions and responses were grouped into 3 broad subscales: oceanic boundlessness (OBN) as previously mentioned, visionary restructuralisation (VRS) to examine the effect of the HVB on vision, and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) which captures the anxiety-inducing effects of the experience related to the idea of the dissolution of the self [15]. The PSL, a 13-item tool used to evaluate panic symptomatology, required participants to rate each item on a five-point scale from “0 – not at all” to “4 – extremely severe”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PSL and VAS for fear/discomfort were scored based on [24]: a significant panic attack was indicated by an increase in VAS fear by 50 points and 4 or more items rated above mild in the PSL (mild = 2).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Online experimental session 1 (REMOTE)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The session was conducted remotely via an online video-conferencing platform (Zoom). Preparatory information was sent to participants after screening and enrolment, including the platform link, instructions, and pre- and post-session questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants received instructions on camera setup and were assigned personal participant numbers. They were instructed to be in a private room to avoid interruptions and to position their cameras to capture their chest and stomach for observation of full-body, continuous breaths. A breathwork facilitator remotely guided groups of participants through the 30-minute online breathwork session. Members of the research team were present online to ensure session consistency and to monitor participant engagement in HVB practice. No group experience-sharing (integration) followed the breathwork sessions to avoid memory and experience merging. Instead, participants self-integrated (processed) their session by completing retrospective questionnaires that explored the qualia of the experience within 30 minutes of concluding the session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Neuroimaging experimental session 2 (MRI)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each participant in the neuroimaging session was scanned on a Siemens Prisma 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner fitted with a 32-channel head coil. High-resolution structural scans were obtained during rest using a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (T1 MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time (TR) = 2300 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.19 ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix = 256 × 256, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3, GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2; total acquisition time (TA) = 5m 30s). Additionally, twenty control and label images were acquired per condition using a pCASL with background suppression following the parameter recommendation of the consensus paper [26]: label duration = 2000ms, post-labelling delay (PLD) = 1800ms, TR = 5000 ms, TE = 14 ms, voxel size = 3.4 × 3.4 × 6.0 mm3, TA = 3m 22s), was acquired. A proton density (M0) image was acquired using the same readout and TR as the control and label images to estimate pcASL CBF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fig 1 is a schematic presentation of the MRI experimental design. Recorded instructions (see S1 Appendix) guided participants to breathe through three phases: BASELINE, START, and SUSTAINED HVB. BASELINE consisted of breathing at a normal rate for 20 minutes. Participants were asked to gradually increase their ventilation rate and/or depth via recorded instructions (START HVB) for approximately 6 minutes. The SUSTAINED HVB phase started after at least 5 minutes of START HVB and once end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2), measured via nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD), was stable at levels ≤20 mmHg (from a typical value of 35–40 mmHg), and was maintained for a further ~20-minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MPRAGE = 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo, ASE = asymmetric spin-echo spiral, BOLD = blood oxygen level dependent, AP/PA anterior-posterior, posterior-anterior. BASELINE = 25 min 32s, breathwork = 23 min 10s. Relaxing music was played at BASELINE during rest for the participant, and evocative up-tempo music that features in breathwork sessions with instructions recorded by a breathwork facilitator were played during HVB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scans were performed during BASELINE (10 minutes after the scan start), at the start of HVB (immediately after initiating HVB), and during SUSTAINED HVB (after at least 6 minutes of uninterrupted breathwork).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SPM12 [27] and custom written Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) scripts were used for image processing and statistics. Rigid-body motion correction was used to realign labelled and control images, and perfusion weighted images were calculated for the realigned control-labelled pairs by subtracting the labelled image from the control. The mean perfusion weighted images were then used to estimate CBF using the one-compartment model [26] and processed to obtain partial volume-corrected [28], tissue-specific (i.e., grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM)) CBF images independently. The pcASL CBF images were normalized maps in MNI space using SPM12 [27]. Participants with prominent arterial transit artifacts in the CBF images, evident by the presence of strong arterial signals upon visual inspection, were excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Psychophysiological session 3 (LAB)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants in the psychophysiology study attended the psychophysiology lab at the Trafford Centre for Medical Research at BSMS. To measure beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and HRV (computed as the root mean square of successive differences, RMSSD) [29], an electrocardiograph (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 device) was applied to the torso [28]. To measure EtCO2, the participant was fitted with a nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD). Following a BASELINE period during which the participant was instructed to breathe as normal to relaxing music for 10 minutes, the participant was instructed to perform HVB (see supplementary index for more information). This began as a 5-minute warm-up (START HVB) where the participant performed HVB to lower their EtCO2 to ≤20 mmHg, followed by 25-minutes of HVB (SUSTAINED HVB) where EtCO2 was maintained ≤20 mmHg, aided by recorded instructions from a trained breathwork facilitator. For analyses, the HVB period was defined as starting once EtCO2 was stable below 20 mmHg and was subsequently recorded for 20 minutes. The recovery period began immediately after HVB was terminated, and participants resumed their normal breathing. Participants completed retrospective questionnaires within 30 minutes of the session’s conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Data analysis and statistics.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective 1: To characterize the subjective response to HVB across different settings (REMOTE, LAB, MRI), we compared affective responses (PANAS-X scores clustered into positive and negative domains), panic-like symptoms (VAS fear/discomfort and PSL) and ASCs. For the 5D-ASC, the percentage maximum score was calculated per participant and dimension [30]. Data were compared across the three experiments to test for differences in self-reported effects. A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was used to examine the effects of setting on the mean responses within each dimension of the 5D-ASC and for the PSL, accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect using the lmer package in R; [31]. We used the likelihood ratio test to compare a full model with a fixed effect of setting and a random effect of subject to a reduced model with only a random effect of subject [31]. Post-hoc tests were performed using the emmeans package in R [32], adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the PANAS-X and VAS, we used an LMM analysis to examine the effects of HVB (pre- versus post-) on setting and the type of question (positive versus negative affect for PANAS; discomfort versus fear for VAS), accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect. We explored two-way interactions between all the variables and post-hoc tests using the same methods as the previous analyses [32].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective 2: In order to test the correlations between HVB-induced ASCs and rCBF effects, two contrasts between HVB time points (see MRI experimental design in Fig 1) were studied using paired-samples t-tests in SPM12 [27]: contrast 1) between BASELINE and START HVB grey matter CBF; contrast 2) between BASELINE and SUSTAINED HVB grey matter CBF. Following this, voxel-wise maps of changes in pcASL rCBF (ΔrCBF) were calculated for the contrasts between BASELINE versus SUSTAINED HVB, and START versus SUSTAINED HVB. These ΔrCBF maps were then used for voxelwise correlation analysis with the OBN score, selected as the highest-rated 5D-ASC dimension. Voxel clusters were considered significant at a cluster-forming threshold of p &amp;lt; 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error (FWE) correction, with a significance level of p &amp;lt; 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective 3: To investigate changes in cardiac autonomic drive during HVB and their relationship to the intensity of ASCs, we calculated change in HRV (ΔRMSSD) and HR. Heartbeat timing data were imported from the Firstbeat Bodyguard device into Kubios 3.5.0 HRV scientific 4.1.0 for processing. Raw data contained substantial noise from chest movement. After an initial phase of artefact removal, interbeat interval (IBI) data were smoothed using an automatic noise detection filter at a medium threshold [33]. A repeated measures ANCOVA with contrasts for different orders of an equation was conducted using HRV and OBN (5D-ASC selected from objective 1) as covariates to explain HRV variance over time, with polynomial contrast applied to identify linear and complex patterns, allowing us to characterise dynamic trends in HRV responses to HVB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-reported data from 42 participants were analysed, comprising 31 unique individuals. Study participants enrolled in one to three experimental sessions: n = 15 (age 42.9 ± 12.6 years, 5 females) for the online experimental session; n = 8 (age 41 ± 13.02 years, 2 females) for the session conducted within the psychophysiology lab; and n = 19 (age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 females) for the MRI experimental session. There were different participants in each condition (3 repeated all conditions, 5 participants participated in 2 conditions, see S1 Fig for key subjective effects of repeated participants). No adverse events, including panic attacks, were reported across all experimental settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Subjective effect results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally, measures of fear and discomfort were low in all conditions (Fig 2, panel C). LMM analyses identified only a significant two-way interaction between HVB and question type (fear and discomfort), with post-hoc tests showing a significant increase in discomfort post-HVB. These results indicate that perceived discomfort increased during HVB, while perceived fear remained stable across settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B) For the 5D-ASC, a linear mixed-effect model did not show an effect of setting (χ2(2) = 3.66, p = 0.160; see ‘Data analysis and statistics’). C) Fear and discomfort assessed by VAS indicated no significant effect of experimental setting on HVB, although there was a trend increase in discomfort and reduction in fear after HVB across all environments. D) Negative affect assessed by PANAS-X was reduced by HVB. There was no significant effect of HVB on positive affect, and no significant effect of environment on negative or positive affect. E) For the PSL, a linear mixed-effect model revealed a significant main effect of setting (χ2(2) = 20.41, p &amp;lt; 0.001; see ‘Data analysis and statistics’). Post-hoc Tukey tests identified significant differences between LAB vs. MRI and MRI vs. REMOTE (LAB – MRI, t(22.11) = −3.78, p = 0.003; LAB – REMOTE, t(28.84) = 0.041, p = 0.999; MRI – REMOTE, t(34.09) = −4.37, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the mean individual post-HVB PSL scores were ≥ 2, indicating that no panic symptoms reached a clinically significant threshold (a score of 2 corresponded to ‘moderate’). However, the LMM identified a significant main effect of setting on the PSL, with post-hoc analyses showing the PSL scores were significantly higher in the MRI setting compared to the LAB and REMOTE settings (Fig 2, panel E). LMM analyses on the PANAS-X found only a significant two-way interaction between pre/post-HVB and affect, with post-hoc analyses revealing a significant decrease in negative affect from pre- to post-HVB (Fig 2, panel D). These results indicate that HVB decreased negative affect, while positive affect remained stable across settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all three settings, HVB elicited altered subjective experiences indicated by positive scores in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC (Fig 2, panels A and B). The highest rated phenomenon was OBN across all three settings, which was selected as a meaningful proxy indicator of the subjective effects of HVB for analysis. A LMM revealed no significant main effect of setting and no significant interaction effect between setting and dimension (Fig 2, panel B).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;MRI results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Datasets from 13 participants (mean age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 female) were included in the analysis. Voxel clusters showing statistically significant CBF reductions occupied 12% and 28.5% of global grey matter volume at START and SUSTAINED HVB, respectively. Global CBF was reduced by 30.5% during START (36.2 ± 12.4 ml/100g/min) and 41.6% during SUSTAINED HVB (30.5 ± 8.5 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first identified a region of cortex where HVB-evoked reduction in perfusion (ΔrCBF from BASELINE to SUSTAINED) correlated with the magnitude of ASC in the OBN dimension. This cluster encompassed left parietal operculum/posterior insula (PO/INS) (Fig 3). Here, rCBF in PO/INS was reduced by 7.7% during the START period of HVB (43.7 ± 10 ml/100g/min) and 18.9% during SUSTAINED HVB (38.4 ± 12.7 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data points represent cluster means. Statistical significance was assessed using cluster size inference (initial cluster-forming threshold: p &amp;lt; 0.001; corrected FWE: p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we identified regions of significant positive correlation between OBN score and ΔCBF changes from START to SUSTAINED (Fig 4). The cluster encompassed right basolateral amygdala and extended to the CA1 region of anterior hippocampus (BLA/CA1) rCBF. Statistical significance was assessed using cluster size inference (initial cluster-forming threshold: p &amp;lt; 0.001; corrected FWE: p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data points represent cluster means. Statistical significance was assessed using cluster size inference (initial cluster-forming threshold: p &amp;lt; 0.001; corrected FWE: p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then investigated if specific concepts related to OBN, namely, disembodiment, experience of unity and blissful state [17], were associated with ΔCBF in PO/INS from BASELINE to SUSTAINED. Analyses identified negative correlations between ΔCBF and the experience of unity (Fig 5A) and blissful state (Fig 5B), but not disembodiment, indicating that the magnitude of subjective experience related to bliss and unity correlated with a reduction in perfusion in this region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Negative correlation between the intensity of subjective experience (blissful state) and CBF in PO/INS during SUSTAINED HVB, relative to BASELINE. Data points represent cluster means. Statistical significance was assessed using cluster size inference (initial cluster-forming threshold: p &amp;lt; 0.001; corrected FWE: p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HRV results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A repeated-measures ANCOVA demonstrated an effect of time on RMSSD through BASELINE and phases of HVB and recovery, indicating a significant within-participant cubic effect. There was a significant interaction effect between OBN and the polynomial cubic contrast, F(1, 6) = 6.211, p &amp;lt; 0.05 (Fig 6).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants were classified into high and low OBN responders using a cutoff score of 50 (50% of the maximum score) to identify ASC experience based on criteria in psychedelic drug literature, e.g., [34].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our study is the first that aims to characterise the relationship between the intensity of ASCs induced by HVB practices and associated central and autonomic nervous system effects, via changes in pcASL rCBF and HRV, respectively. Our findings identified significant correlations that might indicate possible neurobiological substrates of HVB-evoked ASCs, accompanied by music. First, our findings demonstrated that the experience of HVB can be safely reproduced across different experimental settings. The pattern of self-reported experiences elicited within the MRI scanner and psychophysiology lab were analogous to those experienced at home (a more natural and comfortable environment).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During all experimental sessions, participants reported a trend-level reduction in ratings of fear and negative emotions. Additionally, no adverse reactions or panic attacks were experienced by any participants. However, there was a mild increase in discomfort ratings and mild panic-like symptoms were reported during the MRI session – although these were not associated to increased anxiety or panic attacks and might have been evoked by the physical constraints of being inside the MRI chamber. This experience conflicts typical breathwork practice. The observed increase in physical discomfort alongside reductions in fear and negative affect may reflect a hormetic effect, whereby transient physiological or emotional stressors promote longer-term psychological resilience [35,36].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by OBN, which is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. Although differences in OBN scores across conditions were not statistically significant, participants in the LAB condition reported noticeably higher scores compared to MRI and REMOTE sessions. This trend suggests that the in-person experience and controlled, quiet environment of the LAB may have enhanced the immersive and evocative qualities of the breathwork experience. In contrast, the MRI setting—despite also involving in-person contact —may have been less conducive due to scanner noise and physical constraints. Finally, the REMOTE condition, which involved no in-person interaction and took place in participants varied home environments, received the lowest OBN ratings. These findings point to the importance of ‘set and setting’, e.g., [37], a concept well-established in psychedelic research in shaping ASCs and subjective response. These results may indicate that physical context and interpersonal presence play a critical role in breathwork outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, OBN is reportedly the most accurate predictor of antidepressant actions of psychedelic substances [9,38–40]. In the present study, the magnitude of the OBN experience induced by HVB was comparable to that elicited by serotonergic psychedelic substances, including psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) [41,42], reinforcing observations of other breathwork studies [1,2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast-paced hyperventilation induces cardiovascular sympathetic activation (with relative cardiovagal parasympathetic withdrawal) and cerebral vasoconstriction, the latter is a consequence of respiratory alkalosis, resulting from reduced plasma CO2 and H+, which elevates blood pH [43]. Ergo, we focused our analysis on correlations between OBN and changes in HRV (for which decreases capture pro-sympathetic shifts in cardiac autonomic balance) and CBF (where regional reductions reflect cerebrovascular vasoconstriction). Importantly, decreased EtCO2 is implicated as a critical factor in catalysing stronger, deeper ASCs during breathwork and may predict subacute psychological and physiological outcomes [2,44].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our experiments identified that HVB engendered substantive time-dependent decreases in pcASL CBF. The reduction of rCBF relative to BASELINE in a cluster localized within left posterior insula and left parietal operculum predicted the intensity of OBN. This region encompasses primary interoceptive cortex and represents the state of cardiorespiratory arousal, and is consequently engaged in higher-order respiratory control. Correspondingly, neural activity here is enhanced by chemo-stimulated increases in ventilation [45]. More broadly, this insular-parietal region supports the integration of somatosensory information as well as the cortical representation of afferent respiratory and bodily signals [46], for example in the emergence of conscious motor intentions [47]. It is also implicated in high-level integrative processes which merge external and internal stimuli [48,49] that contribute to a coherent, embodied representation of self [50].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These roles are relevant to the interpretations of our finding that rCBF reductions within the PO/INS during SUSTAINED HVB predicted the intensity of self-reported OBN experience. The construct of OBN is closely related to feelings of depersonalization, sense of unity and blissful state [16], and our findings align with the notion that abnormal integration of signals in the posterior insula cortex can result in abnormal body ownership. Studies on ecstatic epilepsy, a rare focal epilepsy, show that the insula is involved in ASC-like experiences, including “heightened self-awareness, mental clarity and unity with everything that exists, accompanied by a sense of bliss and physical well-being” [51]. These overlap with the OBN construct, as assessed in the 5D-ASC [15]. Picard and Craig [52] hypothesised the involvement of the insula in the genesis of ecstatic epilepsy given its role in interoception and self-consciousness, confirmed by intracerebral electrode recordings [53]. Seizures in the mesiotemporal region propagated to the dorsal anterior insula coincide with ecstatic symptoms [54] and stimulation of the mid-dorsal insula region evoked experiences akin to oceanic psychedelic effects [55]. The interruption of interoceptive predictive coding during anterior insula seizures may underlie the ecstatic experience, emphasizing its pivotal role in mystical and psychedelic states [51,52].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then ran an exploratory subsequent analysis (Fig 5) to explore the correlations between sub-dimensions of the 11D-ASC relevant to OBN [17], namely ‘disembodiment’, ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, and CBF reductions induced by HVB relative to BASELINE. We found that scores of ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, but not ‘disembodiment’ were associated with CBF reductions (see S1-S3 Tables for details), which concurs with the notion discussed above, specifically pointing to an involvement of the insula in the genesis of blissful feelings. Of note, 5-HT2A– targeting compounds such as psilocybin, renowned for therapeutic utility, are known to induce CBF decreases in different brain regions that correlate with the intensity of psychedelic experiences [56]. Studies found reduced CBF in the insula following psilocybin administration, though it was not linked to the subjective effects assessed via the 5D-ASC [57].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CBF reductions occur rapidly following decreased EtCO2 and can be reliably detected in response to very brief periods of hyperventilation. Conversely, the profound experiential changes in emotion and thought processes tend to emerge gradually, and correspondingly psychedelic phenomenology appears contingent on the length of the breathwork session [58]. Our investigation therefore compared HVB-evoked effects during late (SUSTAINED) and early (START) phases of HVB to focus specifically on the haemodynamic changes that occurred once the subjective effects had emerged. By contrasting the START and SUSTAINED phases of hyperventilation, we identified a region of right amygdala/anterior hippocampus, where the intensity of subjective experience (OBN as a covariate) positively correlated with CBF changes. Here, increased rCBF predicted the most intense OBN experience, despite the global reduction in CBF. One possible explanation is that this amygdalo-hippocampal CBF increase reflected increased regional neural activation associated with emergent expression of intense subjective effects. These regions are well established as being specialized for emotion (amygdala) and memory (hippocampus) processing. Their reciprocal interactions enable the formation of episodic representations, integrating the emotional significance and interpretation of memories [59]. Interestingly, increased right amygdala blood-oxygen level-dependent responses to emotional faces in functional MRI (fMRI) have been identified in patients with treatment-resistant depression following administration of psilocybin, predictive of clinical improvements at 1 week. The authors posit that this indicates psilocybin aids individuals’ ability to confront, reappraise, and improve emotional responsiveness [60]. Though speculative, these findings may indicate that HVB facilitates the processing of emotionally salient memories, which is proposed to be an essential therapeutic element in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies [61,62], consistent with promising results from clinical trials of HVB applied as a therapy for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [63]. Our finding of increased CBF in the hippocampal region also indicates that a single session of intense hyperventilation selectively alters perfusion to the hippocampus, similar to the effects observed after 20 minutes of hypocapnia-inducing moderate exercise [64]. This finding was interpreted as indicative of short-term metabolic adaptation to the high energy demands of hippocampal neurons, rather than reflecting the effects of mechanical vascular changes [64].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HRV is a physiological index of the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the heart. The observed reduction in HRV reflects sympathetic activation and withdrawal of parasympathetic drive [65–67], consistent with an action-ready state of psychophysiological engagement. As previously described, OBN characteristically entails a deeply felt positive mood linked to the experience of unity with the self and the world, and in its extreme, is experienced as a mystical or religious experience [17]. Our finding that OBN ratings were related to changes in HRV over time echoes observations from other relevant modalities of ASC induction, such as self-induced cognitive trance [68] or 5-HT agonists, such as LSD [18,69–71] or N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) [72,73]. Nevertheless, the observed association with a positive mood contrasts the wide acceptance of reduced HRV as an index of stress and negative affective states. During HVB, the physiological state of the body exceeds typical homeostatic boundaries, and the autonomic correlates of this may reinforce a dissociative psychological state of positive affect in line with the premise of hormesis, see [11] for more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This exploratory work is preliminary and limited by a small sample size and a lack of an independent control condition that may, in our neuroimaging session, have prevented us from separating the contributions of haemodynamic effects secondary to CO2 changes from neural activation. We also acknowledge the possibility that our whole brain voxelwise approach has led to reduced sensitivity to detect significant correlations relative to an a priori region of interest (ROI) approach. In addition, from a methodological perspective, it may be argued that the lack of control group exposed only to music may prevent dissociation of the effects of auditory stimuli (the ambient track) and the effects of HVB. Listening to upbeat music does stimulate ventilation and this should be controlled in the future. Helpful input from lived experience populations indicates that music is a powerful support to therapeutic applications of HVB. In choosing our design, we elected not to “dissect” the music component from HVB, as we preferred to consider HVB as a contemplative practice accompanied by music as a whole – and to test it in its entirety [74]. Importantly, both studies [2,75] have dissected the effect of music and breathwork, and elucidate that music is not the main factor in triggering ASCs. This reveals that music alone is unlikely to engender significant ASCs of the magnitude reported in this research. It is also argued that the reductionist approach of breaking down a contemplative practice to dissect an “active ingredient” is less preferable than testing a practice in its entirety [74]. Conjointly, psychedelic therapy sessions do not adhere to one specific psychotherapeutic model, though one consistent feature of the experience is listening to music. During psychedelic therapy sessions, patients are urged to centre their attention inwardly whilst supine and listening to a carefully selected playlist. It is suggested that music can help facilitate therapeutic experiences. As such, we are looking for CBF changes that correspond with ASCs, induced by HVB with music. We elected to proceed to treat the experience as whole, hence no control for music. More hypothesis-driven work is certainly required within the neuroscience of breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, our study focused on experienced HVB practitioners and therefore our results may not be generalisable; though this is also a strength as it ensured our practitioners were able to reach the desired state without adverse outcomes. Additionally, we were unable to directly assess relevant mechanisms of therapeutic actions, as our subjective measures did not include clinical parameters relevant to traumatic memories or other forms of psychological distress. Moreover, ASCs initiated by breathwork are inherently dynamic, thus dynamic phenomenological tools, such as those employed by Lewis-Healey et al., [58] may be more sensitive and informative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our imaging approach was also limited by the absence of correction for physiological noise caused by cardiac and respiratory fluctuations. This is crucial for most physiological fMRI applications for reducing signal artifacts. However, physiological fluctuations (including respiratory frequency and volume changes) can still introduce signal variations in ASL data, but we believe that our approach remains robust. Our analysis inherently averages over multiple cardiac cycles, which helps mitigate the effects of physiological noise on CBF quantification, and although respiration-induced signal changes are observed in some pcASL studies, they are largely associated with motion rather than direct vascular effects [76]. This does not fully eliminate the influence of an overall increase in HR, respiratory rate, or other physiological parameters during changes in breathing conditions—factors that may also impact labelling efficiency and arterial transit times. These considerations are relevant not only to our study, but to other ASL studies where complex, interconnected factors can influence ASL signal and CBF. Practical constraints limit the extent to which additional physiological measurements can be incorporated, particularly in a study as complex as ours. These constraints include scanning time and the potential stress on participants. Furthermore, measuring CBF at the start of the SUSTAINED HVB rather than at the end or during is not ideal, yet, it may capture the physiological ‘trigger condition’ for entry into ASCs, which can continue irrespective of specific physiological threshold conditions, see [2] for more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A further key reason for choosing not to adopt a method of correction for EtCO2 was a high risk of regressing out our primary signal of interest. One plausible mechanistic hypothesis inspiring our work is that ASCs evoked by HVB practices directly result from alterations in EtCO2 and the resulting cerebral pH, causing downstream effects on neuronal function [11]. Therefore, CO2 related physiological signals are likely correlated with experimental effects that were the focus of our investigation, in line with recent work by others [2] and regressing out these signals would severely impact our sensitivity to study the relationship between haemodynamic effects and ASCs. An additional reason is that our measures of EtCO2 (collected by nasal cannula and capnograph) have been occasionally incomplete during the end of HVB sessions when EtCO2 levels had reached particularly low levels, and we felt that application of correction methods using incomplete physiological data would have risked introducing major artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, we observed prominent arterial transit time (ATT) artifacts in 6 out of 19 participants. These artifacts were characterized by strong arterial signals in the CBF images, which led to their exclusion from the analysis. ATT artifacts can significantly impact the accuracy of perfusion measurements, as they indicate that labelled blood has not yet reached the capillary beds. To address this issue in future research, capturing blood flow dynamics at different delay times through a multi-PLD ASL protocol would reduce the impact of ATT artifacts and increase precision of assessment of cerebral perfusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our exploratory experiments suggest that circuitries supporting the integration of interoceptive representations and processing of affective memories are putative neurobiological substrates of HVB-induced ASCs. Our findings indicate directions for future research towards a better understanding of HVB and ultimately harnessing such practices for future therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Register recently published a story titled Putin on the code: DoD reportedly relies on utility written by Russian dev. They should be ashamed of this story. This poor open source developer is getting beat up now to score some internet points. It’s very upsetting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But anyway, let’s look at some receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re not real smrt, it seems like pointing out an open source project is written by one person in a country you don’t like is a bad thing. It could be. But it also could be the software running THE WHOLE F*CKING PLANET is written by one person. In a country. But we have no idea which country. It’s not the same person mind you, but it’s one person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. Almost all open source is literally one person. What I mean by that is if you look at all the open source projects out there, and there are a lot, we see a pattern of one person no matter how we slice and dice the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s start with the data. A project exists called ecosyste.ms that catalogs a lot of open source. Most of it I would guess, but not all. They currently have 11.8 million open source projects in their data. You would be right to think that is a big number. I’m told anything over 15 is a big number, but it probably depends how smart you are, or think you are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what do we mean by one person is open source. What I mean is if we look at all the projects that ecosyste.ms is tracking, how many have a single person maintaining that project? It’s about 7 million. This is also a big number. 7 million open source projects are one person. It’s actually bigger than that, because of the 11.8 million projects ecosyste.ms is tracking, we don’t know how many maintainers 4 million of the projects have. A bunch of those will be one person. Here’s what a graph of this looks like&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I clipped the graph so it looks nicer. There are projects with hundreds of maintainers. Not a ton, but they exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the clever people among us are thinking “but Josh, surely these 7 million projects are all things nobody uses, the important open source we all use has loads of maintainers!!!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You would be right to think that. It’s the first thought I had back when I started to look at this data. It’s OK. You’re still in the denial stage. Hopefully you’ll reach anger by the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we’re going to use the NPM ecosystem to explain this. I use NPM because they have the richest data in ecosyste.ms to explain my point. I’ve done this same thing across multiple ecosystems and the graphs all look the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what does the NPM maintainer graph look like. Your first thought is probably “why is the left axis green?” It’s not an axis, it’s the single maintainer number. It’s that huge compared to literally all the other data. There are just that many single person NPM projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now, let’s look at the number of maintainers for projects with over 1 million downloads this month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time the graph shows how many downloads projects with over 1 million downloads, and one maintainer or more than one maintainer. It was easier to show the data by creating these two buckets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s almost a 50/50 split. Think about that. About half of the 13,000 most downloaded NPM packages are ONE PERSON. We can change the download number and the graph stays this shape. It’s not until I change downloads to 1 billion downloads that we see 1 package maintained by 1 person, and 9 packages maintained by more than 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is open source. Open source is one person, even the popular stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will also add, a lot of people own more than one package. So while NPM has over 4 million single person projects, they have about 900,000 maintainers for those 4 million single person projects. This will be an important data point at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here’s the big conclusion. If you want to make a big deal about something, maybe it shouldn’t be what country a sole maintainer is from. Let’s face it, the Russians aren’t dumb enough to backdoor a package owned by a guy living in Russia. They’re going to do something like pretend to be from another country with a name like Jia Tan, not Boris D. Badguy. This isn’t a Rocky and Bullwinkle episode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open source, the thing that drives the world, the thing Harvard says has an economic value of 8.8 trillion dollars (also a big number). Most of it is one person. And I can promise you not one of those single person projects have the proper amount of resources they need. If you want to talk about possible risks to your supply chain, a single maintainer that’s grossly underpaid and overworked. That’s the risk. The country they are from is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now if we have news stories being written about how a single person maintainer is the bad guy? That’s not cool (this is where your denial is supposed to turn into anger).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what can you do about this? How can you turn your newly denial-turned-anger into action? We don’t really know unfortunately. I discussed this in a podcast episode Hobbyist Maintainers with Thomas DePierre. Like many hard problems, there isn’t an easy solution. But I guarantee the solution isn’t hunting down and demonizing single maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bookmarks.txt is a concept of keeping bookmarks in plain text files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bookmarked URLs are stored in files named &lt;code&gt;bookmarks.txt&lt;/code&gt;. The format is described below.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A "global" bookmarks file is located in the home directory (&lt;code&gt;$HOME/bookmarks.txt&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Local" bookmarks files could exist in different directories as well.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;URLs are stored one per line and could be accompanied with optional titles. Titles are separated from URLs with one space character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;URL [title]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;a URL without any title&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com ----------------------- ^ URL&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;a URL with a title&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;https://sul.im personal website -------------- ---------------- ^ ^ URL Optional title&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plain text nature of bookmark files allows to use any program to manage URLs. The &lt;code&gt;bin/&lt;/code&gt; directory of this repository contains &lt;code&gt;bookmarks&lt;/code&gt; script that could be used to list existing and add new URLs. However nothing should stop you from building your own tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use fzf to select a URL and open it in the default browser:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;./bin/bookmarks | fzf | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs open&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add a new URL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;./bin/bookmarks https://github.com/soulim/bookmarks.txt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how I use bookmarks.txt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$HOME/bookmarks.txt&lt;/code&gt;contains URLs useful in any context. These are "global" addresses.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each project directory has "local" &lt;code&gt;bookmarks.txt&lt;/code&gt;files with URLs pointing to tools specific to each project (repositories, monitoring tools, dashboards, and so on).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A symbolic link &lt;code&gt;$HOME/bin/bookmarks&lt;/code&gt;point to&lt;code&gt;bin/bookmarks&lt;/code&gt;from this directory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With help of fzf I have a nice menu with fuzzy search to select URLs and open them automatically.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bookmarks.txt is open to code contributions for bug fixes only. As features might carry a long-term maintenance burden, they will not be accepted at this time. Please submit an issue if you have a feature you would like to request.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Certificates for Onion Services¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This document tracks existing procedures or proposals for integrating and validating TLS/HTTPS certificates for Onion Services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some depends on Certificate Authorities (CA) model, others rely on alternative certification and validation procedures that does not require built-in certificate chains in the client software or reliance on financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever you browse the internet regularly, the connection between your computer and a service is usually encrypted, and the safety of this communication happens through the verification of a special type of certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Onion Services, the connection is peer-to-peer encrypted by default, which means that no additional certificates are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as the web and other internet technologies mature, certificates are starting to be a requirement in order to unleash functionalities, especially in web browsers, such as the faster connection protocol HTTP/2 and payment processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's why it's important to improve the certificate ecosystem to fully support Onion Services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a hard problem, and an ongoing effort, but there has been some important work done to solve this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most relevant one should bring automation to the process of issuing certificates for Onion Services, through an enhancement in a protocol called ACME.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ACME for Onions proposal is composed of tools and also an Internet Draft, which hopefully will turn into an Internet Standard soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also looking into other, non-conflicting alternatives that can also be used for certification, so service operators can decide which one fits best their use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improving the certificate functionality will put Onion Services in parity with the modern stack of web development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It may be argued that Onion Services connections are already self-authenticated -- since the public key and the URL are tied together and the connection is peer-to-peer encrypted --, and thus making the need for HTTPS pointless, or at most giving only an impression on users of additional security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But having valid HTTPS connection in Onion Services could enable many other enhancements, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some browser features are available only with HTTPS, like Secure Contexts, Content Security Policy (CSP), Secure cookies, WebAuthn, WebRTC and PaymentRequest.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A user may be using a browser that isn't the Tor browser. For example on iOS there is only Safari, and in such cases the browser will not be aware of the different semantics of security for an onion site, and won't allow the use of secure browser features (such as secure cookies). This limits the kind of web apps people can develop on onionsites as many modern browser APIs mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Allows for the usage of HTTP/2, since some browsers only support it if on HTTPS1. In the future, HTTP2 and HTTP3 may only work with TLS, and thus valid certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It also opens up new opportunities such as payment processing, "as current PCI DSS requirements do not allow non-standard TLS"2 and may only work with certificates having some sort of validation3. Payments card networks require HTTPS for a payment to be taken. So if someone wants to do that over an onion site they would need a TLS certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It could be argued that this is also security-in-depth by having yet another layer of encryption atop of other existing encryption layers. Even if the theoretical gain in terms of interception and tampering resistance is not relevant, it would still allow for service operators to split their encryption keys in different servers -- like one with the Onion Service keys and a backend having the TLS keys, thus making a compromise in one of the servers exposing only the cryptographic material of one of the communication layers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Tor daemon that hosts the onion site might not be the final computer in the chain. In larger organizations, deployment concerns may result in plain HTTP traveling across their network from the Tor daemon to the final web server. Having HTTPs protects those hops in the chain. This is something that distributed setups may need. The same could be said for a web browser using Tor SOCKS proxy somewhere else on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Non-web based applications, such as IMAP/POP/SMTP etc. can benefit from certificates being valid.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is simply too much software that isn't aware of onionsites, and trying to force HTTP-over-Onion to be as secure as HTTPS-over-TCP creates a compatibility mess of things which do and don't know about the semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is value in exposing the existence of an onion site via CT Logs. If someone navigates to the plain web version of a site, and is presented with a certificate containing a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for both the plain web and the onion site that provides a strong cryptographic guarantee that they are the same site. Effectively this would replace the Onion-Location header with something more authenticated4.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following discussion is not yet conclusive, and the problem space may be hard to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Library (PKCS#11 module)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Existing CA validation¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CA/Browser Forum, a consortium that produces guidelines for X.509 (TLS/HTTPS) certification, created validation rules for Onion Service v2 addresses (in 2015), later extended for Onion Services v3 (in 2020), standardizing the way Certificate Authorities can issue certificates for .onion addresses and supports wildcards5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only a few commercial providers currently provide this service6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Appendix B of the CA/B Baseline Requirements (current repository version) for the Issuance and Management of PubliclyâTrusted Certificates (since Version 1.7.4, released in 2021) establishes two validation methods to ensure that someone request the certificate really control a given .onion address:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An "AgreedâUpon Change to Website" (manually or via ACME), where the service operator must include some secret, such as at the &lt;code&gt;/.well-known/pki-validation&lt;/code&gt;of the site.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TLS using ALPN.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Checking of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) signed by the Onion Service private key and containing an specific cryptographic nonce (i.e, a shared secret to be used only once), like using the onion-csr tool.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that both methods does not require that operators disclose the location of the Onion Service, nor them need to have a regular site for the service using DNS. Validation can either happen by accessing directly the Onion Service or by using the service private key to sign a CSR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But still commercial CAs (or financial institution) may still collect identifiable information during the purchase of the certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ACME for .onion (CA-validated)¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, getting certificates from CAs supporting the CA/B Baseline Requirements for .onion addresses is still a manual, or in the best-case scenario, semi-automated task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) standard (RFC 8555) solves part of the automation problem, and with the arrival of RFC 9799 it also supports methods for validating Onion Services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having support for .onion address in the ACME standard is the first step for projects like Let's Encrypt to offer free certificates for Onion Services, without financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing proposals to bring ACME for Onion Services are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ACME for Onions¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Extensions for ".onion" Domain Names" (draft-misell-acme-onion) is the second known proposal to bring ACME for .onion addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the proposal that lead to RFC 9799.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A detailed analysis on ACME for Onions is available in a special appendix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ACME Onion Identifier Validation Extension¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Onion Identifier Validation Extension" internet draft (draft-suchan-acme-onion-00) was proposed on 2022-05 and is the first known proposal to bring ACME for .onion addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of 2023-06-07, this internet draft is in the expired state, being now supplanted by RFC 9799.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relevant mail threads&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;orangepizza/acme-onion-doc: docs about standardize handling onion address in acme context&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-signed certificates¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal basically consists in allowing the use of self-signed certificates with Onion Services:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For web applications like the Tor Browser, this would consist in disabling self-signed certificate warnings when visiting .onion sites. As an alternative, there's also the Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module discussed below and relying on PKCS#11 modules or Authority Information Access (AIA) extensions, which could handle self-signed certificates matching the Onion Service address without the need to merge this logic directly in the applications, as it would remain decoupled in a PKCS#11 module, thus being easier to maintain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For other applications -- like the TorVPN and third-party software --, this would probably require patches or documentation instructing users to accept non-CA signed certificates when accessing Onion Services, which is very hard to provide and to maintain for a wide ranging of tools.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supported key types&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this proposal, any key types supported by applications could be used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case of popular web browsers, the CA/B Baseline Requirements must be taken into account, which as of 2024-09 only allows for RSA or ECDSA keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It could also be possible to use self-signed certs using Ed25519, which is discussed below and currently not widely supported by browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal would not provide:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A self-authentication mechanism (since the certificate is self-signed). This have a huge weight since an important piece of security provided by HTTPS is not just end-to-end encryption but also authentication.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting self-signed certificates with Onion Services has a huge gain, but also introduces an authentication complexity. That's why proper UI indicators and hints are needed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For the encryption state of the site (HTTP and various HTTPS situations).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For the authentication state of the site, telling how it was (not) authenticated.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are already sketches for different scenarios for how various user interface hints and indicators could exist for Tor Browser and other software maintained by Tor, as well as existing certificate proposals that can change the certificate landscape for Onion Services in the future, which could be adopted by operators instead of relying on self-signed certs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But all these enhancements would still limit the practical application domain of this proposal, since it would be readily available only to a small set of applications like Tor Browser, except if by pursuing some standardization such as the SOOC proposal below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-signed X.509 from .onion (self-signed by the .onion address)¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another option for having HTTPS in Onion Services that may be available in the future is to use Onion Service key pair to self-validate an HTTPS certificate using Ed25519 directly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Onion x509 is an example in how a CA self-signed by an .onion could be constructed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There's also a ticket requesting to add support for self-signed HTTPS onion sites derived from onion service's ed25519 key in the Tor Browser.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For an overview of Ed25519, check How do Ed5519 keys work?. For details about how Tor implements Ed25519, check prop220 (and rend-spec-v3 for how it implements at the Onion Services level).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal has the advantage to not rely on Certificate Authorities, but the disadvantage that needs additional logic both server and client side to make it work, since a CA would needed to be installed for every visited Onion Service using this scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;On using .onion keys for certification¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the current (as of 2024-09) Onion Services v3 specification does not allow the Master Onion Service identity key to be used for purposes other than generating blinded signing keys (see Section 1.9 from the rend-spec-v3):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Master (hidden service) identity key -- A master signing key pair used as the identity for a hidden service. This key is long term and not used on its own to sign anything; it is only used to generate blinded signing keys as described in [KEYBLIND] and [SUBCRED]. The public key is encoded in the ".onion" address according to [NAMING]. KP_hs_id, KS_hs_id.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;On Ed25519 certificates support in browsers¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, while many TLS libraries support the Ed25519 signing scheme used for certificates (like in OpenSSL since version 1.1.1), major web browsers still does not support it (as of 2022-12)7, probably because they're not supported8 by the current (as of 2024-09) CA/B Baseline Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;6.1.1.3 Subscriber Key Pair Generation&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The CA SHALL reject a certificate request if one or more of the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Key Pair does not meet the requirements set forth in Section 6.1.5 and/or Section 6.1.6;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;6.1.5 Key sizes&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For RSA key pairs the CA SHALL:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;â¢ Ensure that the modulus size, when encoded, is at least 2048 bits, and; â¢ Ensure that the modulus size, in bits, is evenly divisible by 8.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For ECDSA key pairs, the CA SHALL:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;â¢ Ensure that the key represents a valid point on the NIST Pâ256, NIST Pâ384 or NIST Pâ521 elliptic curve.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No other algorithms or key sizes are permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementing X.509 certs derived from the .onion key pair¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, implementing this proposal would require pushing at least two specification changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A ballot with CA/B Forum about including Ed25519 support.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An update in the Onion Services v3 spec, allowing the Onion Service identity keys to either:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Also act as Certificate Authority root keys for the service.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Derive long-term (1 year) blinded keys to be used as a Certificate Authority for the service, maybe using the same approach described by Appendix A (&lt;code&gt;[KEYBLIND]&lt;/code&gt;) from rend-spec-v3 but covering the needed use case of a long-term key, i.e, depending in a long-term nonce and not in&lt;code&gt;[TIME-PERIODS]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also important to avoid using the Onion Service key directly as the HTTPS certificate. That would:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expose the Onion Service secret key material to more software than it's needed, like a web server.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make it very difficult to manage offline Onion Service master keys.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, it's better to use the Onion Service key pair to act as a CA that then certifies a separate key pair to be used with HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to the self-signed certificate proposal, this approach would have limited adoption if only as small number of applications implement it -- such as the Tor Browser --, except if endorsed by many stakeholders in the form of a specification -- like the SOOC proposal discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module proposal mentioned above, that relies on PKCS#11 modules or Authority Information Access (AIA) extensions, could also be used to work with a X.509 certificate directly derived from the .onion key pair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But contrary to the previous proposal, it would not need to use Ed25519: it would support a signature scheme where an Ed25519 private key could sign an ECDSA key. This Ed25519 signature could either be created using the .onion private key itself or a fresh Ed25519 subkey, thus avoiding key reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Would reduce logic in the Tor Browser by a well-established API.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Does not need to use Ed25519 X.509 certificates: can work with ECDSA which are fully supported by major browsers according to the CA/B Baseline Requirements, and maybe could even work with RSA.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seems future-proof as PKCS#11 modules are widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No reliance on the CA-model (and hence has increased censorship resistance).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No need to use CT Logs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Could be used by other browsers as well (such as Brave).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Could be used with any software, library or Operating System with PKCS#11 support.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the short-to-mid term this would not be supported on OpenSSL (as of 2024-09, support PKCS#11 modules is still underway).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;System-wide support would depend on how each Operating System could support this custom module. So could be hard to add this to TorVPN. But anyway, TorVPN can't validate existing self-signed .onion certs either, as of 2024-09.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Operators currently using self-signed certs would need to migrate to new certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;OpenSSL support for PKCS#11:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Same Origin Onion Certificates (SOOC)¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Same Origin Onion Certificates (SOOC) proposal aims to specify when "in very limited circumstances, we shall not care about signatures at all", allowing clients to disable self-signed certificate warnings when visiting .onion sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main difference between the SOOC proposal and to simply start allowing self-signed certificates is that SOOC is aimed to be an IETF proposal that could gain momentum and hence have a greater chance to be adopt by many different vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the SOOC document for details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DANE for .onion¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another option is to use DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE), with DNS records like this to associate an Onion Service address with a given HTTPS certificate's public key hash:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_443._tcp.testk4ae7qr6nhlgahvyicxy7nsrmfmhigtdophufo3vumisvop2gryd.onion. TSLA 3 1 1 AB9BEB9919729F3239AF08214C1EF6CCA52D2DBAE788BB5BE834C13911292ED9
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order for that to work, logic should be implemented in the client software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Service operators must update this record whenever a new certificate is issued.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Has some limits for wildcard certificates on specific ports.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DANE is not widely supported, especially by web browsers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It would only work for service operators willing to publish the .onion address in the DNS.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Onion-only CAs¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having .onion-only CAs with name constraints (only allowing issuance for .onion). Services available both via DNS-based and .onion domains will need to have two TLS certificates in order to use this approach -- one certificate for the DNS-based domain (as usual) and another only for the .onion address.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certification procedure would be automated, so generated .onion addresses could easily have it's certificates issued by this special type of CA.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certification would then happen by checking a signature in a CSR and comparing the Subject Alternative Name (SAN). Signature must be validated by the .onion address in the SAN.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;So this type of CA would be mainly a basic notary that attests signatures and issues a corresponding certificate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The name constraint for this type of CA ensures that it only issues certificates for .onion domains.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Suppose there's a malicious or bugged CA of this type that issues a certificate containing a SAN for &lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;but:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Without checking whether the CSR has a signature made by &lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;'s private key.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Or if allowing that another, unrelated &lt;code&gt;$address2.onion&lt;/code&gt;actually signs this CSR.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Without checking whether the CSR has a signature made by &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even if that's the case, i.e, the CA wrongly issued a certificate for &lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;that did not match the requirements, this certificate won't work in practice, since in a successful Onion Service TLS connection to&lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;the following must happen:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The underlying Tor Rendezvous connection should ensure that the client is connected to &lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;(Onion Services connections are self-authenticated by the .onion address).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Onion Service should then offer it's TLS certificate, which would not be the malicious one (except if the service is already compromised, but in that case the attacker would not need to forge an invalid certificate anyway...).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Then the client's TLS library tests whether the certificate chain can be verified and any SAN in the presented certificate matches &lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;, among other checks (such as expiration).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The underlying Tor Rendezvous connection should ensure that the client is connected to &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That said, the work done by this special type of CA is only to expand the self-authentication property from the .onion address into a certificate. So the attack surface of this special type of CA may be inherently low.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Since Ed25519 certificates probably won't be supported by major browsers/clients in the foreseeable future (see discussion above at the Self-signed X.509 for .onion section), issuance should probably follow the Appendix B of the CA/B Baseline Requirements.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The entire certification procedure could happen via Onion Services.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Actually the whole CA infrastructure (website, APIs, OCSP etc) could be interacted only via Onion Services, to reduce the attack surface and protect the service location.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Important to consider whether would be possible to organizations setup and maintain a Onion-only CA that's as most automated as possible, including root certificate packaging/distribution/rotation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy to implement on the client side (just need to install the CA).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy to implement and maintain on Tor-native applications such as Tor Browser and the Tor VPN.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Possibly lowest attack surface than with regular CAs!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Largest certification expiration dates could be used (like one year).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Might not be easy to find CAs willing to do this, or to a new one to be formed for this purpose.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Might need a merge request to include this method in the CA/B Baseline Requirements, if wider acceptance is intended.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No guarantees that these special CAs would be installed among all clients and libraries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Need additional security analysis.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Need to check if Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are needed, and how to handle it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Need to figure out how OCSP and OCSP Stapling could happen. OSCP connection could be available behind an Onion Service.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Does sending certificates to CT Logs still makes sense for this special type of certification?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Needs built-in DoS/service abuse protection:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;An idea for that: implement a simple PoW by additionally requiring that service operators provide a proof-ownership of another .onion address made by an specific vanity address (like limited to 5 or 6 chars).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notes¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But not HTTP/3 yet, since it uses UDP not available via Tor (as of 2023-05). The HTTP/2 standard does not require encryption, but all major browsers require encryption for HTTP/2 and encryption for HTTP/3 is required by default. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See PCI-DSS v4.0 - Appendix G - Term "Strong Cryptography" - page 355, which points only to "industry tested and accepted algorithms". While we could argue that PCI-DSS v4.0 is not precise enough about which transmission protocols might be used, it may be the case that the encryption used by the Onion Services' Rendezvous v3 protocol is not (yet) part of an "industry standard" (needs someone to carefully review this claim and open a merge request to update this information). It also may be the case that PCI-DSS compliance may be hard to get for a system that employs only the Rendezvous v3 protocol to transmit cardholder data between an user and an Onion Service, without TLS atop of it. And users might not trust the connection if not over TLS, or if their browser does not show certificate information. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's worth note that PCI-DSS does allow for the use of self-signed certificates under some special conditions that may exclude some of the proposals in this document (see PCI-DSS v4.0 - Requirement 4.2 - Applicability Notes - page 106). In practice, this is only applicable for internal links within an organization or for clients and libraries that have the custom Certificate Authorities' root keys on it's keystores and that matches the standard requirements. And users would hardly trust a self-signed certificate for doing online purchases as their browsers would show warning messages. Recommendation (see PCI-DSS v4.0 - Requirement 4.2 - Guidance - page 106) goes instead towards a certificate trusted by a Certificate Authority. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, the argument about revealing an onion site that would like to remain hidden, is a real one. For those services, it could be considered options such as a non-CT Logs issuing CA that may not be in the "valid" set, but operated by a friendly to Tor organization, which is added to Tor Browser as a valid certifier. The standards space may be moving towards requiring CT log submissions at some point, so this is something to keep an eye on. Another possibility would be to consider writing a standard for hashing onion site names in CT Logs, so they can be verified, but not revealed (such as what WhatsApp did in their Auditable Key Directory). Such a standard could take years to get to place of usefulness, and probably encounter resistance. Otherwise, the only option for such a service operator is to have a self-signed certificate, or none at all. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For a historical background on Domain Validation (DV) certs, check the CA/B forum thread DV issuance for next-generation onion services. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As of January 2023, there are only two CAs issuing certificates for .onion domains: DigiCert providing only Extended Validation (EV) certs and HARICA providing only Domain Validated (DV) certs. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They usually just support X25519, which is a key agreement scheme not to be confused with Ed25519. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is tracked on cabforum/servercert issue #451, which is about adding EdDSA (and hence Ed25519) support in the CA/B Baseline Requirements. Check also the related mail thread (Servercert-wg) Ed25519 certificates. For Let's Encrypt support, check letsencrypt/boulder issue 3649; Request For CertBot To Support The Signing of Ed25519 Certificates and Support Ed25519 and Ed448 forum threads. On IETF, EdDSA and Ed25519 are standardized on RFC 8032, and have Algorithm Identifiers for X.509 Public Key Infrastructure as part of RFC 8410. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Update&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After evaluating the impact and community feedback, the Bitnami team has postponed the deletion of the Bitnami public catalog (&lt;code&gt;docker.io/bitnami&lt;/code&gt;) until September 29th to give users more time to adapt to the upcoming changes.&lt;lb/&gt;To raise awareness before the registry deletion, we will run a series of brownouts over the coming weeks. During each brownout, a set of 10 container images from &lt;code&gt;docker.io/bitnami&lt;/code&gt; will be temporarily unavailable for 24 hours. The scheduled brownouts are:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item style="list-style-type: none"&gt;
          &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;August 28, 08:00 UTC → August 29, 08:00 UTC&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;September 2, 08:00 UTC → September 3, 08:00 UTC&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;September 17, 08:00 UTC → September 18, 08:00 UTC&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The list of affected applications will be published on the day of each brownout via our usual channels.&lt;lb/&gt;As previously announced, since August 28th, we have not published new Bitnami container images or Helm charts to Docker Hub in OCI format. The source code for containers and Helm charts remains available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What's changing?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Starting August 28th, Bitnami will be archiving its OCI registry of charts and images to a new location, Bitnami Legacy, to make room for the new secure, hardened images that will eventually reside in the main Bitnami registry. Users who are currently pulling these images will need to update their pipelines, internal mirrors, and Kubernetes clusters to pull from a new location before that time. A couple of options users have: &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Switch to Bitnami Secure Images &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Switch to the Bitnami Legacy Registry&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To retain existing functionality and maintain continuity of systems relying on Bitnami, we recommend switching to Bitnami Secure Images. In addition to a less disruptive transition, BSI helps strengthen your security and compliance posture by adopting the higher-quality images offered as part of BSI. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Switching to Bitnami Secure Images (BSI)&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While some BSI images will be free, they are only for use in development/testing purposes, and a commercial subscription is recommended for access to the entire catalog, as well as stable tags, long-term support versions, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Though a BSI subscription provides customers with the entire Bitnami Debian-based image catalog (which will continue to receive updates), we recommend users upgrade and start using the hardened Photon Linux-based images instead. These are designed to be replacement images for any of the Debian images and work with the same Helm charts. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Photon images provide many other benefits not previously available to users of Debian images, including: &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Drastically reduced CVE count (e.g., 100+ CVEs to in some cases 0)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;VEX statements for easier triage, along with Known Exploitable Vulnerabilities (KEV) and EPSS scores&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A self-service UI/API with powerful reporting and metadata capabilities&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;More advanced Helm charts are not available on Docker Hub, such as Bitnami’s “distroless charts” which offer an 83% smaller attack surface (by MB).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Support for customizing the images built by our secure SLSA 3 software factory &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Images and Helm charts are delivered to a private and secure OCI registry dedicated to each customer instead of relying on a public registry with rate limits like Docker Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Access to over 90 VM Images in OVA format&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Switching to Bitnami Legacy Registry&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another option for users of Bitnami today is to switch to the historic archive registry called Bitnami Legacy. This is unsupported software that is being made available, at users' own risk, while they make plans for alternatives. As such, this is a temporary solution, and we do not plan to keep this registry around for long. It will quickly begin to accumulate vulnerabilities that are not patched and atrophy as any software frozen in time does. If this is your choice, we strongly recommend copying the images you are using to your own registry; again, this should be considered a temporary solution. While we think there are many better options to make before the August 28th change, this is an option of last resort for those who need more time. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is it a good time to consider upgrading your security and compliance for open source? &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So why do all the work now to change what’s maybe been working and update the type of open source images you use? We get it, no one likes change. But the reality is the landscape of open source is changing all around us. For example, from 2019-2023, the number of malicious packages discovered has risen to more than 245,000 according to Sonatype. That’s 2x all the previous years combined. The implication is that bad actors are finding increasing opportunities to exploit open source software that is running in every major software organization around the world. Meanwhile, with the growth of AI and MCP models, open source consumption is only going to increase. So the risk profile tides are quickly rising around us, and having a better boat to be prepared for the impacts of this change is the only responsible response. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In addition, the Cyber Resilience Act in the EU creates an impending obligation for many organizations doing business there to provide guarantees about the open source software they use in their organization. It could soon be a liability to use open source that doesn’t have the required documentation to prove it’s been sourced from a safe place and hasn’t been tampered with. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is why the launch of Bitnami Secure Images is so timely. BSI is making it easier than ever for organizations to responsibly prepare for what the future of open source software in our modern world looks like. As with many things, what started out simple has become increasingly complex and requires more care to navigate. Furthermore, BSI has one of the lowest TCOs in the industry, enabling more organizations than ever before to afford cutting-edge supply chain security. BSI is effectively democratizing security and compliance for open source so that it doesn’t require million-dollar contracts from vendors with sky-high valuations. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What are Competitors trying to claim about Bitnami? &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s also a great time for the competition to try and steer the narrative about Bitnami. Some have claimed that Bitnami is “pulling their free container images and Helm charts from public access”. However, if we look a little more closely at the changes Bitnami has announced, this statement is inaccurate. For one, Bitnami Helm charts continue to be an open source project, under Apache 2, freely available to the public on GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, what is actually changing is the built OCI artifacts. Essentially, Bitnami has been the Jenkins of the internet for many years, but this has become unsustainable. Operating a build pipeline and OCI registry for the general public is very expensive. Just ask those same competitors throwing shade at Bitnami why they have never offered to make their charts or images publicly available at the same scale Bitnami has?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So users can continue to freely access the Helm chart source (as well as the Debian images). However, in order to sustain and support the dedicated team of engineers who maintain and build new charts and images, a subscription will be required if an organization needs the images and charts built and hosted in an OCI registry for them. And to reiterate the above again, organizations that choose this path are simultaneously upgrading their security posture and improving their OSS strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How do the changes on August 28th work?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The changes to the Bitnami repo are slated to begin on Aug 28th. They will not all be at once. Over a multi-week period, the images will be cleaned up from the registry to make room for the new ones. This is being done gradually to minimize the disruptions. However, we can’t be precise about which image will be removed at what time due to the complexity of the 84TB of OCI content that the engineering team will be dealing with. Therefore, it’s best to assume starting Aug 28th, every image used in a key business function should be addressed with an alternate registry. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re making room in the mainline Bitnami registry so we can populate it with the free tier of Bitnami Secure Images. These hardened Photon have the same names as the Debian images, so they can’t occupy the same registry. And we want new adopters of Bitnami to start with the secure images going forward, as we believe this is the future of open-source software on the internet. In this FAQ, you can find more information about all the details of the upcoming changes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moreover thanks for the, SCI-hub it is very helpful. without this not my but I can say the Ph.D. and Research if now depends upon it. Still, there are some publications that cannot be reached by the SCI-hub. But it is the best help from you. Yor are doing real research and applying for the use of people of this earth. Otherwise everyone is making money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hii dear Alexandra Elbakyan. Th website SciHub you have developed is like an oasis in the desert for people like me. I am assistant professor in a Pharmacy College in Central India. The research articles which need payment are very costly. SciHub is the only source where I can get them. Thank you very much for this endeavor. Please continue this work uninterrupted. God bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done. When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money. I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job. My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India. Thank you very very much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just want to thank you a million times over for making research papers available to us scholars in India without access to most of the expensive sites. Without sci-hub my ongoing Ph.D. would have been impossible and the same holds true for so many of my friends pursuing research. Thank you for doing what you do and believing in all that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship. I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster" I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes. Where the mind is without fear and the head held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

It saves a lot of time and money, especially for those who came from small and mid size college and universities with limited resources. I am using it from last 2 years, for research work in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Do keep it up. Happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am extremely happy and I appreciate your efforts for Sci-hub activities. Because of your hard work, in Sci-hub I am able to complete my Ph.D. recently. Please do not stop your work in sci-hub, because it's very very useful for low financial researchers/countries.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them. Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost. Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application. Thanks again (Hey! You are a hacker, please don't hack my email. My intention is only to thank you) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible. As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute. I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub. I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research. I have used your website number of times. I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life. Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them. I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub. I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim. I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science. Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article. I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research, Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub. Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic. Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.&lt;/p&gt;

You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains. hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times. Love again from India.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

I saw your message on the sci-hub.se regarding interest for neuro research and religion and culture. Hence wanted to show appreciation for your work and thought. Thank you once again for giving us sci hub a platform for true knowledge and the genuinity in gaining knowledge for the aspirants who come from a poor background. Thanks a lot.👍👍&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a native speaker of Tamil (Oldest language). Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub. I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D. The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It feels so nice to have guys like you in science community. I read about you today while downloading a paper. I am doing my internship and realize how hard it would be for me if people like you would not have made amazing things like sci-hub. This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students! Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India. Take Care! May almighty fulfills whatever you aspire in life!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you. I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am Heera Jayan, a Ph.D. student in food science and engineering. I came across with sci-hub when I was working on my thesis for masters in India. I would like to thank you on behalf of every student for making sci-hub happen. This movement is especially helpful for those who are doing higher education in colleges that are unable to provide institutional access to first quartile journals. I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India). Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page. First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me. Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm Aditya, an undergraduate from India and a fan of yours. My institute gives access to many commercial research paper websites, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll are staying at our respective homes. Since then, I was having a hard time accessing the research papers behind the paywalls, and one day a friend of mine called, and he told me about sci-hub. It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My name is Pranav Mhaisalkar. I am a biology researcher from India. I want to take this moment to express my sincere gratitude for the work you have been doing. Thank you so much for providing us with so many scientific articles. It wouldn't have been possible for me to gain knowledge without Sci-hub. Certainly, you are an inspiration for us. PS: I love symbolization of Raven with a key. Its an amazing concept.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;For my master's program I need to keep reading research papers and couldn't access them thanks to paywall. My classmates told me about your website and now, obviously, I can access them. So thank you for your brilliant website. I went through your profile and it is very interesting. Your passion for learning is quite inspiring as well. I wrote this mail to thank you for the website. It is amazing, THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN!!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you Alexandra for the fantastic work you do in keeping Scihub alive. I am morally conflicted in using the services but I have other option as access to these papers is prohibitively expensive for small not-for-profit entities like my own organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you.I am doing PhD and had it not been for you, conducting research, searching for articles and references would have been very difficult. It has made things easier.I think your efforts to make information accessible to all should be recognized and lauded. I just hope that somehow, someday you are able to you gain the respect your efforts deserve. On my part, I am grateful to you and love you for being there!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all. On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money. As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come. I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on. Thanking you again&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free. I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ... You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you. Thank you for providing us Sci-hub. This is of immense help to academicians like you. I am a teacher, University Professor. It is not possible for me to pay for each and every article. Moreover I do lots of editorial activities for free. Only because of you we are gaining access to whatever we need for our academic purposes. All the best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been using Sci-hub since the last 3-4 years (or even earlier) and whenever I wasn't a part of an institution, it was impossible for me to access material through official repositories ( I never have enough money XD). So I wanted to explicitly write to you my sincere thanks for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am studying in India, and unfortunately, my University does not have the funds to subscribe to the majority of the publications. I usually rely on public libraries, but they are also insufficient sources of research material. I came across Sci-Hub, and it has been my saviour! I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude for the website and to let you know that you are an inspiration to women all over the world. Myriad students in India are able to pursue their education only because of Sci-Hub. A Million Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

I am a postgraduate chemistry student and I open the website like hundred times a week. Once your website was not opening and I needed a journal, I was in an anxiety attack. But thankfully the website is back up and running. The smile and simple grey tee show your simplicity and I really feel proud of you. Hope you are doing well !! Your fellow daily user !&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon. Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall. Can't thank you enough for it!!! Stay well, stay healthy, stay blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the research world. Most of the researchers have been benefited from the Sci-Hub project and I am one among them. I am writing this mail to share my thanks to you for your support for the researchers. I am a researcher from India who didn't have sufficient resources to purchase the research articles. Sci-hub became a boon to me to access the research articles and to continue my research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance. However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged. We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise. With warmest regards&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello Alexandra, I hope this email finds you well. I would like to appreciate the excellent work that you are doing for the greater good of science. I just can't imagine a day where I do not visit your website for reference work. Just like me, millions around the world rely on sci hub for their work and I hope you continue to fight against capitalistic companies which try to hoard scientific knowledge from the common masses. Wishing you all the best on this path of yours. Thank you. Regards.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AppGoblin has now run over 40k apps in an emulator, tracking millions of API calls thousands of advertising domains. Unfortunately, some of them are dark, meaning they have no landing page of any kind, and I’m unclear who controls these domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;news-cdn.site&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;marketingcloudapis.com&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;kickoffo.site&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;onegg.site&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;lazybumblebee.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;qa-analytics.com&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;acobt.tech&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;yastatic.net&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see if we can figure them out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;qa-analytics.com&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is a mystery. Seems like it’s related to Germany since it’s always resolving to HETZNER and german IPs. Checking the shared IPs, it looks like they do overlap with unity3d.com domains sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, this whole list is games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Woodoku – Wood Block Puzzle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Draw Climber&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spider Rope Hero: Action Game&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running Pet: Dec Rooms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bubble Shooter 2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pirate Treasures: Jewel &amp;amp; Gems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tik Tap Challenge&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collect Em All! Clear the Dots&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gun Simulator &amp;amp; Lightsaber&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;data deep dive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the requests I can match various keys to values from untiy3d.com API calls! Specifically they share the same `app_key` values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;acobt.tech&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well that name definitely comes off as esoteric at first. First let’s check the IP cluser and see what we find, of the 233 apps sending/receiving from acobt.tech we have 4 other sites with 1:1 matches that are all sites that do not have any landing pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;acobt.tech 233&lt;lb/&gt;news-cdn.site 233&lt;lb/&gt;inmense.site 232&lt;lb/&gt;kickoffo.site 232&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;searching…&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching the internet shows various hits saying some of these belong to Bigo Ads. Let’s check the apps’ SDKs and see&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again we got lots of games, and looking it looks like AppGoblin has indeed already found that each of these has a Bigo Ad SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pizza Ready!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sculpt People&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vita Mahjong&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modern Bus Simulator: Bus Game&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gym Heros: Fighting Game&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Blockman Go&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;onegg.site&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait, this one also matches the IPs for the other various Bigo Ads. Seems like Bigo really uses a lot of random domains?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;lazybumblebee.com&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, great name. This one appears in clusters of SDK advertising, making me think it’s related to a mediation SDK of some kind (rather than to one specific ad network). Possibly this is bidmachine.io’s as it is the most common, but really all the top ad newtorks appear nearly 1:1 along side it across the 276 apps I’ve found it in:&lt;lb/&gt;bidmachine.io 275&lt;lb/&gt;unity3d.com 270&lt;lb/&gt;doubleclick.net 269&lt;lb/&gt;mtgglobals.com 267&lt;lb/&gt;rayjump.com 267&lt;lb/&gt;applovin.com 261&lt;lb/&gt;vungle.com 257&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example Apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definitely game focused list here. They almost all call variations of &lt;code&gt;d.lazybumblebee.com/track/sdk-event&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Helix Jump&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Going Balls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Paper.io 2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;aquapark.io&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snake.io – Fun Snake .io Games&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hole.io&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1945 Air Force: Airplane Games&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Shared IPs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking around there are lots of examples of shared IP addresses with everestop.io and bidmachine, so I think that might have solved that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;everestop.io 172.240.40.172&lt;lb/&gt;bidmachine.io 172.240.40.172&lt;lb/&gt;bidmachine.io 204.74.252.252&lt;lb/&gt;everestop.io 172.240.61.171&lt;lb/&gt;voisetech.com 34.216.198.39&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SDK?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like a lot of the apps have the &lt;code&gt;io.bidmachine&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;com.explorestack&lt;/code&gt; SDKs, so I’m thinking that `lazybumblebee.com` does indeed belong to BidMachine and helps it with some app mediation service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;marketingcloudapis.com&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;marketingcloudapis.com&lt;/code&gt; is just the kind of generic descriptive name I’d come up with.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example Apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example apps, there are a lot of very corporate apps in here along with lots of shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;adidas: Shop Shoes &amp;amp; Clothing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claro música&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Domino’s Pizza USA&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SiriusXM: Music, Sports &amp;amp; News&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GasBuddy: Find &amp;amp; Pay for Gas&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example API Call&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each app sends off two API calls on start to a unique (per app) subdomain on marketingcloudapis.com with the response from the first API call below. The information sent seems somewhat bland compared to the usual deep scraping that advertising SDKs do. So this is likely paired with other API calls already going out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;x-mashery-message-id: 4e9eb0f4-6eaa-4f27-bb66-a3694cffe471 x-mashery-responder: 56bf7c64cc-lnkfz strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block x-frame-options: DENY x-content-type-options: nosniff cache-control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0, no-store, private Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin Vary: Origin, X-HTTP-Method-Override Content-Length: 339 Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 Date: Wed, 27 Aug 2025 22:12:39 GMT Connection: keep-alive Keep-Alive: timeout=5 { "nodes": [ { "version": 1, "name": "blocked", "items": { "blocked": 0 } }, { "version": 1, "name": "pushFeaturesInUse", "items": { "inbox": false } }, { "version": 1, "name": "appConfig", "items": { "inApp": { "gateEventProcessingMs": 1000 }, "event": { "activeEvents": [] }, "endpoints": [], "deliveryReceipt": { "deliveryReceiptStatus": 0, "gateDeliveryReceiptProcessingMs": 5000 } } } ] }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Related Domains&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Checking on domains that are called together, it looks like this is almost always called with &lt;/del&gt;&lt;code&gt;googleapis.com&lt;/code&gt; so possibly this is related to Google, but this is a bit weak as a lot of Android apps have integrations with Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDIT: I posted this on HackerNews and user politelemon correctly identified this as SalesForce. Very awesome spot by that user, and it matches the various AppGoblin SDKs for each app as in this example for the Adidas app SDKs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;End Results!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much better than I expected. A bit of digging and all the URLs were figured out with the exception of marketingcloudapis.com which I was a bit unsure of, but looks like google.com&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Foundation models for time series&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are on a mission to create the forecasting foundation model to rule them all. Forecasting drives critical decisions worldwide - impacting staffing, supply chain management, finance and more. Our solution provides companies with the models, platform and APIs they need to easily generate the most accurate forecasts possible, helping to significantly reduce waste and enabling smarter, more confident decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As our founding software engineer, you will have the ability to pick up nearly any part of the stack when needed, from developing our customer-facing APIs, robust data pipelines, or our web application. You’ll work closely with our founding data engineer, data scientist and machine learning engineers on challenging (often greenfield) problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are passionate about your craft, maintain high standards, stay current with the latest tech and know when to make trade-offs to deliver results efficiently. We do not believe great engineers are “jack of all trades”, but rather that they excel at diving deep into complex topics quickly, leveraging a broad range of experiences to solve challenging problems. You are also open to exploring new concepts, technologies, and enjoy quickly throwing prototypes together to kick the tires. You prefer quick feedback loops, rather than aiming for perfection on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to provide the most accurate and easy-to-use forecasts to our customers, by leveraging refined information from their own industry. Foundation models for time series are changing this entirely. With the current advances in data processing and model training, we can now pre-train models on diverse temporal data across industries. We provide value to our customers by enabling rapid interaction with our models when provided data and context in natural language, delivering real-time forecasts with accuracy reports. Our customers do not need to be data scientists or have a PhD in Machine Learning to build and ship an accurate forecasting system for their use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example use cases include demand forecasting for large furniture chains, predicting sales for a restaurant group and revenue forecasting in the gaming industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The founders Geoff and Joachim are both Machine Learning PhDs who have built forecasting and ML systems from scratch at JP Morgan, Amazon, Google, Bloomberg, and Sonos in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are a global company that happens to be HQed in Paris. Get the best of both worlds — Silicon Valley work ethic and ambition in the center of Paris, right across from the historical Stock Exchange, in the Sentier.&lt;/p&gt;
