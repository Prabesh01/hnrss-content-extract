    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Angel Investors, A Field Guide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been lucky to work with some of the best angel investors in the business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started Akita, my angel investors were my mentor Jason Hong, superangel Elad Gil, #ANGELS co-founder Jana Messerschmidt, Eventbrite co-founders Kevin and Julia Hartz, Stanford professor Dan Boneh, and NBA player Kevin Durant. I became a more well-prepared and well-connected founder thanks to my angel investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first became a founder, I had little idea how much working with the right angel investors could help. This post is everything I would tell a first-time founder (who is headed down the VC-funded) route about working angels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Akita’s fundraising story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first check into my company was a SAFE from Jason Hong, a fellow CMU professor who has been an incredible mentor, both when I was in academia and after I became a founder. At the time, I had only been out of a PhD with a real job for two years and did not have the savings to bootstrap for long, so Jason’s investment was substantial. Jason’s uncapped SAFE gave me the runway to not worry about raising immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sooner than I expected, I raised a seed round co-led by Martin Casado at a16z and Mike Vernal at Sequoia. Once the round came together, there was only room for a small number of checks. Martin and Mike both advised strategic angels instead of friends and family to fill out the round, so that’s what we did. They put together a short list of angel investors who had been helpful to their companies and introduced me. We ultimately brought on Elad Gil, Jana Messerschmidt, Kevin and Julia Hartz, and Dan Boneh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was at dinner with my a16z investor Martin Casado when I told him I wanted investment from Kevin Durant. It was fall 2018, KD was playing for the Warriors, and he had won Finals MVP earlier that year. I was a KD fan and had heard he did tech investing. Martin said, “How sure are you that you want him?” He sent one text to someone who happened to be walking into KD’s house at that very moment. KD said congratulations and the following week I had Thirty-Five Ventures on my cap table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My personal experience with angel investors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2017-2018, the first year of my company, Julia Hartz was running EventBrite so I worked with Kevin. This was before Kevin started his VC firm A*. During this time, he was spending a lot of time with founders and entrepreneurial folks. Kevin had incredible stories from his experience with Xoom and Eventbrite and I loved learning from him. One conversation that stuck with me: I was telling Kevin how my two lead investors had both interviewed a key product hire for the company. One was positive and one was in the middle. Kevin said to always be “strong yes” or “strong no” if I could help it. I still hire according to this philosophy today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jana Messerschmidt was probably my angel investor who was the most generous with her time and introductions. Jana was transitioning from doing angel investing to being a venture capital investor, having just started a job at Lightspeed. As a former exec at Twitter and Netflix, she had a fantastic network and especially in developer experience. Jana introduced me to developer experience executives, founders who had been good at developer experience, and ex-founders who gave great founder advice. Jana gave me great advice about how to leverage my investors: for instance, she told me to make a spreadsheet of customers I wanted warm introductions to and send it around. Jana telling me about how Crashlytics engineered themselves to go viral and introducing me to Jeff Seibert had a huge influence on how I think about developer products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elad was elusive but the angel who was most consistently influential and supportive during my entire five-year run at Akita. We had a fifteen-minute call almost every quarter, sometimes at an unpredictable time, but always full of great guidance. When I was pivoting the company in 2020, saying that my original space was not working, Elad reminded me it was working for other people, just not Akita, but that’s okay. When I was gearing up for what I knew would be a tough fundraise in 2023, Elad went to work, making introductions to several promising potential investors. Elad has somehow seen every single startup situation and knows so many different founders that he had something concise and on-point to say in every single situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Figuring out when and how to bring on angel investors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can either think of angel investors as the first checks in, or filling out a round. In my case, I had both: Jason Hong’s check gave me runway as I figured out my fundraise. I met my strategic angels once I decided on my investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having good angels early on can help you get advice and introductions early on. That said, a lot of folks in the ecosystem will pay it forward and help you even if they are not involved as angel investors. My earliest angel investor Jason Hong was definitely helpful to me early on with advice, book recommendations, and stories from when he started Wombat Security. I also learned a lot from other ex-founders who were generous enough to give me 30-60 minutes of their time. I also cashed in pretty much every favor from friends and family to meet potential investors and to get feedback on the early product. Most of these people weren’t investors!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic angels. Strategic angels are who I filled my seed round out with after securing institutional VC investment. These are folks who you add to the cap table for complementary reasons to your institutional investors. Some strategic angels invest full-time; others are operators in a similar space to you. Some folks will bring on strategic angels for social proof. When it looked like the seed round was just going to be Martin from a16z, we had started throwing around names of angels that would be good for filling out the round. After we split the round with Sequoia, Martin told me the split alone was enough proof. We were able to then choose angels completely based on gaps in our networks and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vanity angels. There’s a difference between a strategic angel and a vanity angel, a celebrity who invests in companies. These angel investors are less likely to be active in working with companies than institutional investors or strategic angels. They often have more name recognition to friends and family and junior hires. A lot of celebrities coinvest with major venture capital firms and many have their own family offices or investment staff. For instance, in working with Kevin Durant interfaced with his investment organization Thirty-Five Ventures, which was more extensive than I had initially expected. Folks will generally work in organizations like that if they have investing ambitions of their own and they were more helpful than I expected in offering introductions. I like the advice to have no more than one on your cap table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Friends and family. Outside of my mentor Jason Hong, there is one kind of investor missing from my cap table: friends and family. My decision not to take friends or family investors for Akita came out of a personal hesitation to mix friendship with business. There was also little room left in the round by the time it got split between two institutional investors. In some of my tougher moments of Akita, the folks who ended up being the most motivated to help were the friends who had offered to invest, but who I didn’t end up working with as investors. In my own experience on the other side as an investor, the situation where I was probably the most helpful was one with a good personal friend, but it was also a situation where I would have probably given the same support regardless of the investing relationship. For me, jury’s still out about friends and family investors, if you’re also taking VC funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Leveraging your angel investors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first started working with Kevin Hartz, he said an investor relationship was like a gumball machine, except with help. You ask for help and you get help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best advice I have about working with your angel investors: get to know them. One to two times early on is enough to build a relationship. If they’re helpful, even 15-30 minutes once a quarter or half can go a long way. The more they know about where we are, the more they can help. Plus, these folks were way more experienced than I was with startups. Even offhand stories from their own startup experiences, or those of companies they worked with, were incredibly educational to me. The more they know about who you are, what you’re doing, and what you need, the more they can help. And the more you know about how they can help, the more you can lean on them for help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easiest way to keep in touch and stay top-of-mind for your investors: send monthly investor updates. The updates provide context to investors that help them help you: what stage the company is at, what the next big milestones are. At the end of each update, I would always put three to five specific requests for the investors, from helping with introductions to helping with hiring to helping amplify a launch. Upon the recommendation of one of my investors, I also put thank-yous to investors who helped the previous month. The combination of asks and shoutouts consistently got me helpful responses from my investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also one more important thing to understand about angel investors: angels can help in ways that institutional investors cannot. There’s one major reason underlying this: if a VC investor is doing their job well, they will make sure to keep investing in your company until they have a good amount of ownership. This means it is against their incentives to introduce you to other investors or do anything else that interferes with their ability to buy more shares in your company for a good price. Angel investors, on the other hand, are generally not jockeying for a large portion of your next round and everybody knows it. This allows them to play a much bigger role in helping you fundraise, from introducing you to other VCs to talking up your company to generate more interest across different VCs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My perspective from the other side&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a whole spectrum of how investors and companies work together and everybody will tell you something different, so I’ll end with telling you about my specific take on angel investing, in case that helps founders who are trying to learn how to think about the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I angel invest primarily through my scouting relationship with the VC firm Andreesson Horowitz. They give me a budget for investing in each fund and I get a fraction of the carry. The goal is to invest in companies I’m excited about, that also fit the profile of high-growth companies a16z would be excited about. I started scouting for three reasons. First, it gives me more skin in the game to keep up with not only my space but adjacent spaces. Second, I’m happy to pay it forward if I can be helpful. Finally, startups have an unmatchable energy and great founders are fun to be around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My criteria for companies I decide to work with: I’m excited about what they do and believe I can help. Angel investing is a hobby for me, so it’s really about where I get energy and what I want to be thinking about in my limited free time. I discovered I am almost exclusively interested in infra companies where the team is building a product in a B2B SaaS domain I’m familiar with. I particularly like product-led growth and I love developer tools. As for the specific companies, I need to first and foremost understand and believe in the problem they’re solving: it’s usually a problem space I’ve looked at myself, am interested in looking at, or have personally experienced. Then everything else I care about is fairly standard: how well is the team executing; do they have the differentiation necessary to take them all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Parting words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve read all the way to the end of this post, you probably know way more than I did when I started Akita and brought on my angel investors. But I also recognize that I was extremely lucky and would like to help you create your own luck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you’re going the VC-funded route, cap space will be limited, signalling matters a lot, and your network can go a long way in helping you signal. Choose your angels well and they can help you a lot! 😇&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With thanks to Umesh Khanna, whose Forward Deployed Angels series got me thinking about the importance of demystifying the angel/founder relationship. Thanks Umesh for kicking off the series by featuring TLDC and me!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel like your font treats symbols as second-class glyphs? Are you frustrated that &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; looks nothing like an arrow, and &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; seem ever mismatched?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to experience the beauty of ligatures without losing the simplicity of ASCII?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myna (Gracula religiosa 🐦⬛) is a monospace font which aims to bring harmony to your editor by treating symbols as first-class glyphs alongside alphanumeric characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myna was borne out of a need to scratch a persistent typographical itch. While I've tried many otherwise well-crafted monospace fonts, I always found myself wanting to tweak a glyph here or adjust a shape there. After developing Myna and using it almost exclusively in my professional and personal work, I'm sharing it as a small contribution to the wonderful community of monospace typography enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few of its attractive features that might make it your next favourite monospace font:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symbol-First Design: clear emphasis on ASCII symbols which are ubiquitous in programming languages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Near-Perfect Alignment: multi-character symbols like &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;=~&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt;align seamlessly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Balanced Weight: symbols have just the right visual weight against your code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimalist Forms: geometric shapes for quotes and commas&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear Distinction: no more confusing &lt;code&gt;1 l I |&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;0 O o&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language-Aware Design: clean sigils for Perl + elegant operators for Haskell + clear symbols for C&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NB: Myna is designed to be a simple font. The current release is a single weight without ligatures, though future updates may expand its features if demand arises. It does work out nicely with synthesised bold generated by fontconfig and pango on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Myna started out as Hera which was a customised version of Source Code Pro but now has come a long way after stealing many beautiful designs from Fira Mono, Inconsolata, Plex Mono, Office Code Pro, Anonymous Pro. Detailed credits could be found in the Hera repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code banner and illustrations were produced using ImageMagick and Ray.so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myna is designed to be used universally in every kind of terminal and editor. I've tried to include a reasonable subset of non-ASCII glyphs (mostly geometrical and mathematical characters). However, I'm considering expanding it based on community interest and would welcome contributions in these areas:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bug Reports: spacing and kerning issues, rendering problems, unavailable/incorrect glyphs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Feature Requests: suggest new glyphs or features via GitHub Issues&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ruby already solved my problem 😅&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;One great question in office hours led me to delete a whole class.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I hosted November’s Hotwire Native Office Hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every month I host an hour long Zoom session for developers to directly ask me questions. The topics range greatly: some folks are just getting started and others are asking very specific, advanced questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month we covered everything from registering bridge components to native vs. web-based tabs to authenticating Apple Watch apps! It’s really fun to see what folks are working on in the Hotwire Native space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the session I shared some code I wrote to figure out what version a Hotwire Native app is running. The app sends the version in the user agent (e.g. &lt;code&gt;v1.2.3&lt;/code&gt;) and then I parse it with the following Ruby class on the server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class AppVersion
  include Comparable

  attr_reader :major, :minor, :patch

  def initialize(version_string)
    parts = version_string.to_s.split(”.”).map(&amp;amp;:to_i)
    @major, @minor, @patch = parts[0] || 0, parts[1] || 0, parts[2] || 0
  end

  def &amp;lt;=&amp;gt;(other)
    [major, minor, patch] &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; [other.major, other.minor, other.patch]
  end

  def to_s
    “#{major}.#{minor}.#{patch}”
  end
end&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it works great! I use this throughout my apps to feature flag code based on which version the app is running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But someone brought up something even better: &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt;. This class accomplishes the same goal: “process string versions into comparable values”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.3") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.2")
=&amp;gt; true

irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.2")
=&amp;gt; true&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can even compare prerelease versions, like alphas or betas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0.b1") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.9")
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0.b1")
=&amp;gt; true&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big advantage this class has over my implementation is that it’s built into Ruby!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not even a Rails dependency but part of the standard Ruby library. Internally, this class is used to compare version numbers when parsing your &lt;code&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt;. Check out the documentation, I picked up a few things on semantic versioning when reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve already replaced my &lt;code&gt;AppVersion&lt;/code&gt; class with &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt;. But it makes me wonder what other Ruby/Rails features I don’t know about and am implementing on my own!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The power of community, no matter how small&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never would have learned about &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt; if it wasn’t for someone bringing it up during office hours. I’d still be using my custom (and most likely buggy!) &lt;code&gt;AppVersion&lt;/code&gt; implementation… like a chump. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But seriously, this is why I love connecting with folks in the Ruby/Rails community. Every time I go to an event, host a workshop, give a talk… I learn something new. Sometimes it’s small things like &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt;. Other times it completely changes my career, like the first time I heard about Hotwire Native.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve taken this to heart and recently started organizing monthly Coffee and Code coworking sessions in my city, Portland, OR. Every month I post up at a local coffee shop with my laptop and invite all of the Portland Ruby Brigade to join.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month we had five people! It’s no corporate-sponsored-meetup but it sure is something. And the connections that folks are making during these casual events are real. I’ve already seen folks exchange emails for potential future contract gigs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s the first step you can take today to build some community in your local area? Even if it is just finally inviting that connection-to-be for a beverage… I say go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to join next month’s office hours then consider becoming a paid subscriber of my newsletter. I hope to see you there! 👋&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple is crossing a Steve Jobs red line&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can fault Tim Cook for a number of things. Number one on the list, of course, is that he is not Steve Jobs. The nerve of that man!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What made Steve an effective and visionary leader was that his values were so crystal clear. He inspired Apple’s troops to excel in innovation, design and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he was also passionate about something that seems almost “old school”—the customer experience. Creating the best experience would lure new customers and build brand loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how Steve laid out his plan to us at the ad agency when he returned to a nearly bankrupt Apple in the late 1990s. The customer experience was all-important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From that point on, Steve would go on to spend lavishly on things that improved the experience, and he would reject—often brutally—any idea that diluted or harmed the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was Steve’s red line. Cross it if you dare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And what is the status of that distinct red line today? Sadly, it’s getting a bit blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent reports say that we will soon be seeing ads in Apple Maps. Just as we saw ads appear in the App Store in 2015 and get amped up in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll go out on a limb and say that uninvited advertising is not normally equated with a better customer experience. Why would Apple do such a thing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shocker—it’s about money. One can only imagine how eyes lit up in the Apple boardroom as they celebrated a new revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who knows how, or even if, these ads register with Apple users as they become more visible. After all, ads are all around us today, everywhere we go. Still, many will shake their heads in disappointment that Apple—one of the richest companies on earth—is selling a piece of its soul for a bit of easy money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What would Steve Jobs do?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I usually dodge that question on the grounds that it’s pure speculation. However, in this case, it is not speculation at all. I was in the room when Steve was presented with an eerily similar “opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some time ago (1999-ish), agency chief Lee Clow and I were invited to a hastily scheduled meeting with Steve and his top lieutenants. The topic was building advertising into the Mac system software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that time, customers paid $125 for the annual upgrade to the Mac OS. It was proposed that Apple offer two flavors—an ad-free version for $125 and a free version subsidized by ads. Something for everyone! Free choice!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A number of ways to integrate ads were discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One was to show a cool video from a respected company (such as Nike) every time the Mac starts up. Another was to place ads in the OS contextually. For example, an “out of ink” notification might contain an ad for an ink supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After spirited debate, there was no immediate decision. But days later, Steve told me he had killed the idea. His bottom line was that it degraded the pure, elegant, clean interface that Mac users love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t matter that customers would be free to choose a version with or without ads. He didn’t want any user to see the OS polluted in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was protecting Apple’s crown jewels. He wouldn’t sacrifice the purity of the Mac experience to make a few extra bucks. He avoided the slippery slope by refusing to step onto it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All hail the red line!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, fast-forward to the present. Apple’s evolution tells us that red lines do not magically live forever. They exist only as long as company leaders want them to exist. Without proper maintenance, they begin to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever his reason, Tim Cook is not as protective of the user experience as his predecessor was. If we were to ask Tim why it’s okay to bring ads into Apple products now, but wasn’t okay during Steve’s reign, the best (only?) answer would probably be, “Today’s Apple is very different from Steve’s Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quite true. And that is exactly the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use Rust to build multi-platform applications from a single codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ribir is a Rust GUI framework that helps you build beautiful and native multi-platform applications from a single codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experience a novel approach to UI development that's directly based on your data structure APIs. Any data mutation will trigger a precise UI update. Your focus should be on designing your data structure and its APIs. Then, you can describe your data's UI without intruding on its logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple example of a counter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use Ribir without DSL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use ribir::prelude::*;
fn main() {
  App::run_with_data(
    || Stateful::new(0),
    move |cnt: &amp;amp;'static Stateful&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt;| {
      let c_cnt = cnt.clone_writer();
      let mut btn = Button::declarer();
      btn
        .on_tap(move |_| *c_cnt.write() += 1)
        .with_h_align(HAlign::Center)
        .with_v_align(VAlign::Center);
      btn.finish().with_child(pipe!($read(cnt).to_string()))
    });
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More Examples&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Declarative language It doesn't introduce a completely new language. Instead, it provides a set of Rust macros for easier interaction. You can choose to use it or not.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Widgets compose system has four kinds of widgets to support you can implement your widget in different ways: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;function widget and &lt;code&gt;Compose&lt;/code&gt;, from other widgets composition.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Render&lt;/code&gt;, implement your layout and paint anything you want.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ComposeChild&lt;/code&gt;, control the compose logic between parent and child widgets and specify the template of child widgets.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;function widget and &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-intrusive state converts your data to a listenable state and updates the view according to the change of the state.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Layout system learning and inspired by Flutter Sublinear layout, but not the same.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Event system is a composition event system, that supports event bubbling and capture. Allow to compose with any widget, and exists only if you use it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Theme System: Supports using different themes for various parts of the sub-tree and enables theme modifications at runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Painter converts the view to 2D paths.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU render is a backend of the Painter, do path tessellation so that you can easily render the triangles in any GPU render engine. A wgpu implementation is provided as the default GPU render engine. Tessellation base on [lyon].&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text support basic text typography and IME input, in a usable but rough stage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Widgets library provides 20+ basic widgets, but all are in a rough stage, and the API is not stable yet.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ribir is actively being developed and tested on desktop platforms, with both desktop and web platforms integrated into our CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the framework can compile and run on mobile platforms, we haven't fully tested or adapted the user interface for them yet. We plan to focus on mobile support once the core framework is stable and a production-ready widget library is released.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are no strangers to Big Tech platforms occasionally reprimanding us for posting Linux and homelab content. YouTube and Facebook have done it. The pattern is familiar. Content gets flagged or removed. Platforms offer little explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when that happens, there is rarely any recourse for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, a popular tech YouTuber, CyberCPU Tech, has faced the same treatment. This time, their entire channel was at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;YouTube's High-Handedness on Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Rich had posted a video on installing Windows 11 25H2 with a local account. YouTube removed it, saying that it was "encouraging dangerous or illegal activities that risk serious physical harm or death."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Days later, Rich posted another video showing how to bypass Windows 11's hardware requirements to install the OS on unsupported systems. YouTube took that down too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both videos received community guidelines strikes. Rich appealed both immediately. The first appeal was denied in 45 minutes. The second in just five.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rich initially suspected overzealous AI moderation was behind the takedowns. Later, he wondered if Microsoft was somehow involved. Without clear answers from YouTube, it was all guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then came the twist. YouTube eventually restored both videos. The platform claimed its "initial actions" (could be either the first takedown or appeal denial, or both) were not the result of automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, if you have an all-organic, nature-given brain inside your head (yes, I am not counting the cyberware-equipped peeps in the house). Then you can easily see the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If humans reviewed these videos, how did YouTube conclude that these Windows tutorials posed "risk of death"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This incident highlights how automated moderation systems struggle to distinguish legitimate content from harmful material. These systems lack context. Big Tech companies pour billions into AI. Yet their moderation tools flag harmless tutorials as life-threatening content. Another recent instance is the removal of Enderman's personal channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, actual spam slips through unnoticed. What these platforms need is human oversight. Automation can assist but cannot replace human judgment in complex cases.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t think of any other language in my 45 years long career that surprised more than Zig. I can easily say that Zig is not only a new programming language, but it’s a totally new way to write programs, in my opinion. To say it’s merely a language to replace C or C++, it’s a huge understatement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will present the features that I found to be most seductive in the language, and I will also present a brief overview about it. The goal is to present simple features for programmers to quick start in the language. Be aware, though, that many more features are affecting its acceptability in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the most incredible virtue of Zig compiler is its ability to compile C code. This associated with the ability to cross-compile code to be run in another architecture, different than the machine where it is was originally compiled, is already something quite different and unique. These features alone, completely out-of-the-box, are causing an incredible impact in the industry already. In spite of that what we want to concentrate on is how to program in Zig and why should one choose Zig instead of any other language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing the compiler is quite simple. In Zinglang’s download page one finds the compiler in several formats, depending on the processor or OS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Windows 10, for example, one chooses the x86_64 zip file and copy its decompressed content in the desired directory. For example, in “Program Files”. I modified the root directory name to “zig-windows-x86_64” because in this way I can just copy another version of the compiler with no need to modify the path in Path environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, one adds this root directory path to the Path environment variable using Advanced System Properties (clicking on 1-4, pasting path on 5, and clicking “OK” on 6-8):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that after setting the path to Zig’s root directory one can already use the compiler in CLI mode. That’s the recommended way to use it for the sake of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s recommended to build a “Hello World!” program using the instructions in the “Getting Started” section in this site. An alternative installation procedure is also presented there, including for MacOS and Linux (“Installing manually” is highly recommended). It’s also recommended to check the “Language” Basis section, for a deeper insight of Zig language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following sections will give a bird’s eye view of Zig language. Their goal is to instruct the programmer how to quickly start programming in Zig by just knowing a few basic concepts and commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a compact view on how to build programs and test modules is given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a deeper view on how low level programming can be done in Zig. A more detailed explanation on the examples used is also given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, variable declarations in Zig have potentially three parts. The first part contains the accessibility (&lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; or nothing),
followed by the word &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;, followed by
the variable name. The second part, separated of the first part by a
colon, contains the variable type declaration. The third part is the
initialization of the variable. Only the first and third part are
compulsory in Zig, which is kind of puzzling, coming from Java or C. One
may wonder how the compiler discovers the variable type. The type in
this case is inferred by the initialization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var sum : usize = 0;         // variable declaration with 3 parts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variables that don’t have their accessibility explicitly &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; are local to the module, that is, they aren’t
accessible outside the source file it was declared (just like
&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; variables in C). It’s not recommended to have
variables declared &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; and it’s recommended to have just
few functions declared &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; in a module to discourage
coupling and encourage cohesion. The &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; functions behave
as the module’s API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Zig, a &lt;code&gt;.{&lt;/code&gt; closed with a &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; is an
“anonymous struct literal” - an anonymous struct mostly used to
initialize the elements of another structure or to create a new
structure with its elements initialized. A &lt;code&gt;.{ }&lt;/code&gt; is an an
empty anonymous struct literal. The word &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; followed by
a &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and closed with a &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; is a struct
declaration. One can initialize a variable with a type, which functions
as an alias to the type. Notice the “test block” allowing to
compile and execute tests without the need of an executable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitfields are declared fields with types having specific sizes in a &lt;code&gt;packed struct&lt;/code&gt;. Pointers can point to a specific bit field
as shown here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zig syntax is clearer than C’s, except that one would think it should be &lt;code&gt;[0..8]&lt;/code&gt;, but in reality it’s an open interval:
&lt;code&gt;[0..9)&lt;/code&gt;. Advantage in Zig: the type
declaration of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, its initialization, test, and
incrementation are automatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;[_]&lt;/code&gt; defines an array with unknown size. It must be followed
by the type of its elements (here &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt;, unsigned
byte) and its initialization between &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;. In this example below, the initialization is saying that
this is an array of unknown size (&lt;code&gt;[_]&lt;/code&gt;) where each element
is of type &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; (unsigned byte) and each element initialized
with zeros (&lt;code&gt;{0} ** 81&lt;/code&gt;). Notice that the size is also
inferred by the repetition factor (&lt;code&gt;81&lt;/code&gt;) of the
initialization (&lt;code&gt;{0}&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var grid = [_]u8{0} ** 81;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see in the figure below a test environment with a loop interacting over the array and adding its elements. The &lt;code&gt;try expect&lt;/code&gt;
statement verifies that &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; is not a type or reserved word in Zig.
Here, it’s a variable to hold each of the array’s elements on each step
of the loop. Notice that a variable declared between two &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;
with an array between the parenthesis of a for loop is always assumed of
the same type as the array elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice also, that &lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt; is the natural unsigned integer
for the platform. That means on 64 bits machines it’s an
&lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt;, and in 32 bits machines it’s an &lt;code&gt;u32&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointers to arrays can use pointer arithmetic only if the pointer is explicitly declared as a many-item pointer, here &lt;code&gt;[*]const i32&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that the array below is
&lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;, can’t be changed, but that the pointer is
&lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When attributed the address of an individual array position, a pointer cannot be updated with pointer arithmetic. In this case, &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; only prevents its value to be changed with another
direct address attribution. To dereference pointers in Zig one uses the
&lt;code&gt;ptr.*&lt;/code&gt; as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zig can do many things in compilation time. Let’s initialize an array, for example. Here, a labelled break is used. The block is labelled with an &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; after its name &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; and
then a value is returned from the block with &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This syntax may look overwhelming. &lt;code&gt;0..&lt;/code&gt; means an infinite
range starting with zero. In the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, variables &lt;code&gt;pt&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; are respectively initialized with the address of
&lt;code&gt;initial_value&lt;/code&gt; array and zero. During the loop both are
incremented automatically and the loop stops right after dealing with
the array’s last position. Also notice how to dereference the
&lt;code&gt;pt&lt;/code&gt; pointer: &lt;code&gt;pt.*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also interesting it’s how the array is declared in the labelled block. The array is called &lt;code&gt;initial_value&lt;/code&gt; and has 10
positions of the type &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt; (declared afterwards).
Variables must be initialized in Zig. The way to explicitly not
initialize is with the reserved word &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functions in Zig are declared with &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; and are static by
default (cannot be imported in other files) in the file they are
declared, except when &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; is preceded by &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt;. A
function can be “inlined.” Function pointers are preceded by
&lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; and followed by the function prototype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structs can have functions. Here, a simple stack is implemented. This stack is declared and used only inside the module it is defined, and it accesses and modifies other data structures in the module that are irrelevant in this example. The stack can have at maximum 81 elements (as seen in &lt;code&gt;stk&lt;/code&gt; declaration), each one of type
&lt;code&gt;StkNode&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that ++ and –– operators don’t exist in Zig.
The equivalent += and –= should be used instead. The stack pointer is
just an integer used as an index in the &lt;code&gt;stk&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that the pointer &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; is not a
reserved word, but it’s just a convention) is not passed explicitly as a
parameter as one would normally expect. It is indirectly assumed that it
is a pointer to the instance of the stack the function is been called
from. In the example below, a stack pop would be called with
&lt;code&gt;stack.pop();&lt;/code&gt;. In this case the pointer &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;
corresponds to a pointer to &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt;. This pointer is then
somewhat equivalent to &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; in Java or C++.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function &lt;code&gt;init()&lt;/code&gt; is the stack constructor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice as well that functions &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;
are “inlined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build an executable program one needs a &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;
function, which indicates the program entry point as in Java or C
programs. When this function exists the set of modules can be compiled
to an executable code. A simple program can have a &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;
function in the same file as the rest of the program. In many cases one
can also insert a main function at the end of a module to create an
executable in order to debug the module independently. Once debugged
this function can be commented out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these situations one can use the following command line to compile &lt;code&gt;program.zig&lt;/code&gt; and to generate an executable program (on
Windows, a &lt;code&gt;program.exe&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig build-exe -O ReleaseFast program.zig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be put inside a batch file to prevent typos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the best feature of Zig as a programming language. This environment is normally used for testing, but it can also be used for prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A block in Zig is similar to a block in C or Java, that is, some code between &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;. A test block is a
block that starts with &lt;code&gt;test "message" {&lt;/code&gt; and finishes with
&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;"message"&lt;/code&gt; is a string containing the
message to be displayed when the test is executed (in this case only the
word message).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test blocks are executed independently from an executable file. The final executable file does not execute the tests. The test blocks in a given &lt;code&gt;module.zig&lt;/code&gt; are compiled together with the entire code
in that file and executed by the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig test module.zig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a real life example, the test block from module example.zig is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;test " =&amp;gt; testing set and print functions" {
    set(
      "800000000003600000070090200" ++
      "050007000000045700000100030" ++
      "001000068008500010090000400"
    );
    std.debug.print("\n" ++
      "===================\n" ++
      "Input Grid\n" ++
      "===================\n",
      .{}
    );
    print();
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that &lt;code&gt;example.zig&lt;/code&gt; alone has no main
function and, therefore, cannot generate an executable, but its test
block can be executed by using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig test example.zig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the message says, the test block above tests the functions &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;. As the code shows,
&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; passes a string of decimal digits as a parameter,
followed by a print statement (which prints a header saying “Input Grid”
), followed itself by a call of the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real display in a command tool is the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus now on the &lt;code&gt;std.debug.print&lt;/code&gt; statement. This
statement is in fact a call to the function &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; in
&lt;code&gt;debug.zig&lt;/code&gt; in the standard Zig library &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt;. The
first parameter is a format string, and the second is an anonymous
struct (preceded by a dot) containing a list of variables to be
displayed using the format string. Since there is no formatting in the
format string, the struct is empty. This is how formatted prints are
done. This one will display in the stderr by default, as shown
above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all looks just like in C language, but there is a fundamental difference here. In C, the printf function dynamically interprets the format string in execution time, whereas in Zig it’s possible to deal with the literal string and the list of variables in compilation time. This is a difficult principle to grasp at the start. Many things can be executed in compilation time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a debugger is not usually a straightforward task, except in IDEs that already integrate a debugger (as in Java IDEs such as Eclipse or Intellij IDEA) or in integrated development kits (such as w64devkit for C/C++).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge inconvenient in using debuggers in this way is that one must integrate the symbols, which not only bloats the code with information that is not useful to the program, but also requires compiling in Debug mode, which generates executable code that’s notoriously less efficient. Someone with practice in complex systems knows that it can be a very time consuming task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zig offers a quite convenient hack in order to avoid these headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This built-in stops a program at the point where a &lt;code&gt;@breakpoint();&lt;/code&gt; is inserted in the source code when its
executable is run in a debugger. This is actually an useful feature to
debug optimized Zig code without the need of symbols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All it’s needed is to trace the variables one wants to watch using &lt;code&gt;std.debug.print&lt;/code&gt; right before &lt;code&gt;@breakpoint();&lt;/code&gt; In
this way one can know what are the values of the variables at that exact
moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a real life example, one generates an executable for module debug_example.zig which has the has the following &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pub fn main() !void {
    set(
      "800000000003600000070090200" ++
      "050007000000045700000100030" ++
      "001000068008500010090000400"
    );
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be able to double check with the results from example.zig, the parameter passed to &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function in this
&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is the same string as the one passed to
&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; in the test block in example.zig,
but this time one inserts the following code inside &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;
function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;        if (c != 0) {
           print();
           std.debug.print(
              "Current digit {}\nposition in string {}\n" ++
              "line {}\ncolumn {}\ncode {b}\n", 
              .{c, k, i, j, code}
           );
           @breakpoint();
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can then generate the &lt;code&gt;debug_example.exe&lt;/code&gt; executable
with the following build command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig build-exe debug_example.zig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, one uses a debugger to call &lt;code&gt;debug_example.exe&lt;/code&gt;. In
this case I used &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;, a debugger for C/C++ included in
w64devkit, but it could be any debugger for executable programs. Once
inside &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;, one needs to run the program using an
&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; command and typing &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; right after as
shown below. Notice that the program printed the grid with its contents
so far as well as the variables, stopping
at the point expected. Then, by typing &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; command followed
by an &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; one continues tracing the grid contents and 
the variables. After that, one can continue by just typing 
&lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; (it repeats the last command - &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, in this 
case). By continuing typing &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; until the program finishes, 
the values found in the grid correspond to the values shown by the test 
block in &lt;code&gt;example.zig&lt;/code&gt; above, since both examples have the same
parameter passed to &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the introduction and the examples given in the previous sections, one can already start programming Zig for writing generic applications. For more advanced programmers, what follows is a more in-depth analysis of some interesting low-level features already used in the examples, but not yet explicitly commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of the examples shown is to construct a module that sets (initializes) and displays a 9x9 matrix. This matrix will hold a Sudoku grid, that is, it will only contain elements with decimal digits. The initialization of the grid should guarantee that the grid satisfies the rules of Sudoku game, so it will contain no errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time it would be also an excellent opportunity to demonstrate Zig’s low level capabilities, at least the most noticeable ones, and these examples fit this goal quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole hypothesis behind these examples is the representation of a grid digit as a bit in the position given by its value. This representation is quite convenient to detect if a digit is already present in the grid or not (these are basic rules of Sudoku grids). In spite of that, this is so encrypted it is only used internally in the module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the purpose of having values that are easily understood by humans, the digits are actually stored in the matrix as standard &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; integers. Even though the input grid in the examples is
given in string format, the ASCII characters are internally converted to
&lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; integers. The digits’ storage in the grid is organized
linearly, line by line, in an array with 81 positions, called
&lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt; in the examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var grid = [_]u8{0} ** 81;        // Sudoku grid stored linearly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To verify grid correctness, one needs to access the elements by its respective line and column. In other words, one needs to access the elements as in a matrix. The strategy is to create an array of pointers with 9 positions, each one pointing to the start of each line. Blocks of code cannot in principle return a value, but in Zig they can with labeled breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const matrix = fill9x9: {         // matrix array to allow access  
   var m : [9][*]u8 = undefined;  // to grid element as a matrix, 
   var pt : [*]u8 = &amp;amp;grid;        // thus: element = matrix[i][j]
   for (0..9) |i| {               //
      m[i] = pt;                  // stores pointers of each line
      pt += 9;                    // at each position of matrix
   }                              //
   break :fill9x9 m;              // initializes matrix with m
};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the loop, &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; is returned outside the block
using a &lt;code&gt;break :fill9x9 m;&lt;/code&gt; command. Notice that
&lt;code&gt;fill9x9&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the name of a label placed right
before the beginning of the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supposing &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, respectively an
element’s line and column, any element of the grid can be accessed using
this notation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;element = matrix[i][j]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key concept used here is the replacement of an integer decimal digit &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; by an integer &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;      i ∈ [1,9]  →  code = 2ⁱ⁻¹
      i = 0      →  code = 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the only bit of &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; that is set to
&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is the bit at the position &lt;code&gt;i-1&lt;/code&gt; if
&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is between &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise
all bits of &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; are zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; for
each digit&lt;p&gt;The table below shows the correspondence between digits and their binary representation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; in
Zig&lt;p&gt;The value of &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; is calculated in the function
&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; using a left shift operator only if &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is
not zero:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;code = @as(u9,1) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (c-1);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zig, constants must have a proper size in order to allow an operation to be compiled and to attribute the the result of an operation to a given variable. In this case, &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; is declared of type
&lt;code&gt;u9&lt;/code&gt;. That’s another fundamental quality of Zig, to be able
to have variables with arbitrary bit size. As can be
seen in the table above, the maximum value that &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; can have is 256,
which requires at least 9 bits to represent. The built-in
&lt;code&gt;@as&lt;/code&gt; allows to cast the &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; constant to type
&lt;code&gt;u9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By representing digits as bits one can mirror the entire grid in much simpler ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The array &lt;code&gt;lines&lt;/code&gt; mirrors the entire grid by representing
each line with a &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; bits integer, each bit representing a
decimal digit that might be present in the a line:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var   lines   = [_]u9{0} ** 9; &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, by just accessing this array with the line &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; of an element in the 9x9 grid one can know if a given
digit is already present in that line, by just performing a bitwise
and ( &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; ) with the digit’s
&lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;, in this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lines[i] &amp;amp; code&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the result of the operation above is zero, this means the digit is not yet present in the line &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise we have a
duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The array &lt;code&gt;columns&lt;/code&gt; mirrors the entire grid by
representing each column with a &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; bits integer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var   columns = [_]u9{0} ** 9;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, by just accessing this array with the column &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; of an element in the 9x9 grid one can know if a given
digit is already present in that column, by just performing a bitwise
and ( &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; ) with the digit’s
&lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;, in this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;columns[i] &amp;amp; code&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the result of the operation above is zero, this means the digit is not yet present in the column &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; . Otherwise it’s a
duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s suppose an empty Sudoku grid, as it is the case when one is populating the grid with the input string as done in the examples. A new digit inserted at any empty element, must not already exist in the entire line, column or cell containing the new element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s suppose now this grid, already initialized:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cell is each one of the nine 3x3 grids delimited by the thick lines. The key knowledge to understand at this point is that each specific element in the 9x9 grid has a unique line, column and cell that contains this element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the first cell of the grid contains the values: 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Therefore, the values: 1, 2, 4 and 7 are missing. Let’s suppose one is willing to place the value 7 in one of the empty places in the first cell. Obviously, one cannot place it in the only empty element of the first line, because 7 is already present in that line. One cannot place it in the only empty place in the first column either since 7 is already in that column. One can only place the 7 in one of the two empty elements of the second line. But one can’t know for sure which one is the good one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine now the second cell, which contains the values: 1, 5, 7, and 9. One can see that the only possible element in this cell where an 8 can be placed is in the first line at the empty position on the right of the value 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrays &lt;code&gt;lines&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;columns&lt;/code&gt; take care of
checking duplicates in lines and in columns. A new array is then needed
to check duplicates in cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The array &lt;code&gt;cells&lt;/code&gt; mirrors the entire grid by representing
each cell with a &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; bits integer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var   cells   = [_]u9{0} ** 9;    // all elements at each cell&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where things get more complicated. One cannot access &lt;code&gt;cells&lt;/code&gt; directly using the line or the column. It would be
easier if one could access &lt;code&gt;cells&lt;/code&gt; as a 3x3 matrix. This can
be done mimicking what has been done for the 9x9 matrix, that is,
filling the array &lt;code&gt;cell&lt;/code&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const cell = fill3x3: {           // cell array to allows access
   var m : [3][*]u9 = undefined;  // cell elements as a matrix,
   var pt : [*]u9 = &amp;amp;cells;       // cell[cindx[i]][cindx[j]]
   for (0..3) |i| {               // 
      m[i] = pt;                  // stores pointers of each line
      pt += 3;                    // at each position of cell
   }                              //
   break :fill3x3 m;              // initializes cell with m
};                                //&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now one needs to determine the line and column in &lt;code&gt;cell&lt;/code&gt; matrix from the line and column of the element in the
original 9x9 grid. One could use integer divisions to divide the line
and column by 3 to obtain the proper indexes, but a division operation
is notoriously slow. Two divisions makes it even worse. One can use the
following array to give the result of the division as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const cindx   = [_]usize{ 0,0,0, 1,1,1, 2,2,2 };&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, by just accessing this matrix with the line &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and column &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; of an element in the 9x9 grid,
one can know if a given digit is already present in this element’s cell
by just performing a bitwise and ( &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; )
with the digit’s &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;, in this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cell[cindx[i]][cindx[j]] &amp;amp; code&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the result of the operation above is zero, this means the digit is not yet present in the cell. Otherwise it’s a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete test to verify if an element is duplicated can be done by composing with a bitwise or ( &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; )
all the previous elements in the same line, column and cell, and then
performing a bitwise and ( &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; ) with
the element’s &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;, in this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (((lines[i]|columns[j]|cell[cindx[i]][cindx[j]])&amp;amp;code) !=  0) {
    unreachable;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the result is zero it’s because the element doesn’t exist yet in its line, column or cell. If the result is not zero the program stops because it tries to run the instruction &lt;code&gt;unreacheable&lt;/code&gt;. This
is the simplest way to explicitly indicate an execution error in Zig.
Notice that the actual code in &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function also prints the
details where the error occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, replacing the &lt;code&gt;'0'&lt;/code&gt; right after the first
&lt;code&gt;'8'&lt;/code&gt; by a &lt;code&gt;'5'&lt;/code&gt; in the string passed to
&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; gives the following error while testing example.zig:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because in column 1 there was already a 5 in line 3 as the error message says. The error is due to a panic caused by reaching an unreachable code at function &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; as indicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In function &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;, a double &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop
interacts line by line to copy each new element from the input string
&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; into the grid as indicated below (variable &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;
keeps the index of the new input character in the string
&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   for ( 0..9 ) |i| {
      line = matrix[i];
      for ( 0..9 ) |j| {
        c = @intCast(s[k]-'0');
        if (c != 0) {
          code = @as(u9,1) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (c-1);
          ⋮  // rest of the code
        }
        line[j] = c;
        k+= 1;  
      }
   }&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character is converted to an &lt;code&gt;u4&lt;/code&gt; (variable
&lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;) by subtracting &lt;code&gt;'0'&lt;/code&gt; from it. If the new
element to be inserted in the grid is not equal to zero (
&lt;code&gt;c != 0&lt;/code&gt; ), &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; (calculated with a left shift
instruction as indicated) is copied in each of the mirror grids, by
doing a bitwise or ( &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; ) with the
corresponding mirror grid, that is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    lines[i] |= code;
    columns[j] |= code;
    cell[cindx[i]][cindx[j]] |= code;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No test is required to explicitly test if the value of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;
is between &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; because an overflow will
occur at execution time when the shift operation is executed. For
example, replacing the &lt;code&gt;'0'&lt;/code&gt; right after the first
&lt;code&gt;'8'&lt;/code&gt; of the input string by a &lt;code&gt;':'&lt;/code&gt; in the string
passed to &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; gives the following error while testing example.zig:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By substituting the same &lt;code&gt;'0'&lt;/code&gt; by a &lt;code&gt;'/'&lt;/code&gt; a
similar execution error will issued. The program will work only if the
values are between &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;, that is, if the
input grid contains only decimal digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Sudoku grids on the web also represent &lt;code&gt;'0'&lt;/code&gt; as a
&lt;code&gt;'.'&lt;/code&gt;. That’s the reason the following line exists in
&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (s[k] == '.') c = 0;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will conveniently bypass the shift operation because the value of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forced errors shown in the two sections above demonstrate important features of Zig that might have passed inconspicuously. One is Zig’s robustness. In the case of the shift operation no wrong behavior is allowed and the situation is caught at execution time, as has been shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might think that all the efforts in Zig are towards efficiency, but here it’s a typical case where performance was traded for robustness. One can have mixed feelings about this decision, when performance was the ultimate goal. In C, for example, it’s the programmer’s problem if a shift operation loses a bit and this translates in better performance for this specific Assembler instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another feature demonstrated in the two sections above is the possibility of using the test blocks for prototyping as suggested at the beginning of the article. The possibilities are numerous, even though the application shown was only to debug certain situations in cases of error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features alone demonstrate an awesome power, very rare in programming languages, particularly in compiled programing languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all quite surprising and let one think that many advantages previously found only in interpreted languages are gradually migrating to compiled languages in order to offer more performance. [A reference to Mojo here looks appropriate].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zig resemblance to interpreted languages is quite striking, particularly with its concept of compile time execution, unfortunately not stressed enough in this article. This is an aspect of Zig that on one hand makes it particularly different and powerful but on the other hand difficult to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I concentrated more in instructing how to have a quick and easy start with the language, and in simple aspects that make Zig language cool, although there are many other aspects not mentioned here that are also quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The examples shown here are simplified versions of a more involved program to solve Sudoku grids, which was also developed in Java and in C. The documentation in this repository explains in detail most of the structures and algorithms used to accomplish that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beta Status: Valdi has been widely used in Snap's production apps for the last 8 years. We're calling this a beta because our tools and documentation need more battle testing in the open source world. Valdi will exit beta when we're happy with the developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework that delivers native performance without sacrificing developer velocity. Write your UI once in declarative TypeScript, and it compiles directly to native views on iOS, Android, and macOS—no web views, no JavaScript bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A basic Valdi component:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Component } from 'valdi_core/src/Component';

class HelloWorld extends Component {
  onRender() {
    const message = 'Hello World! 👻';
    &amp;lt;view backgroundColor='#FFFC00' padding={30}&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;label color='black' value={message} /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/view&amp;gt;;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework designed to solve the fundamental problem of cross-platform development: velocity vs. runtime performance. For 8 years, it has powered a large portion of Snap's production apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike frameworks that rely on web views or JavaScript bridges, Valdi compiles declaratively rendered TypeScript components into platform-native views. Valdi also includes several other performance advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic view recycling - Global view pooling system reuses native views across all screens, dramatically reducing inflation latency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized component rendering - Components re-render independently without triggering parent re-renders, enabling fast incremental updates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized layout engine - C++ layout engine runs on the main thread with minimal marshalling overhead&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Viewport-aware rendering - Only visible views are inflated, making infinite scrolling performant by default&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more in our Performance Optimization Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valdi eliminates the traditional compile-test-debug cycle that slows native development:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instant hot reload - See changes in milliseconds on iOS, Android, or desktop without recompiling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full VSCode debugging - Set breakpoints, inspect variables, profile performance, and capture heap dumps directly in VSCode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Familiar syntax - TSX components with TypeScript for type safety&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valdi integrates easily into existing apps - start small and scale as needed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Embed Valdi in native - Drop Valdi components into existing UIKit or Android view hierarchies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Embed native in Valdi - Use platform-specific views within Valdi layouts via &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;custom-view&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Polyglot modules - Write performance-critical code in C++, Swift, Kotlin, or Objective-C with type-safe bindings to TypeScript&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full-stack architecture - Build entire features in Valdi with worker threads for background processing, eliminating platform-specific bridge code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valdi generates type-safe bindings between TypeScript and native platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic code generation - TypeScript interfaces compile to Kotlin, Objective-C, and Swift bindings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native API access - Direct access to platform APIs and third-party native libraries through polyglot modules&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bidirectional communication - Pass complex data structures and callbacks between TypeScript and native code safely&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native protobuf support - Seamless integration with protobuf for efficient data serialization&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Powers critical features in production Snap apps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supports advanced animations, real-time rendering, and complex gesture systems&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexbox layout system with automatic RTL support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Worker threads for multi-threaded JavaScript execution&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native animations for native look and feel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Advanced gesture recognition with platform-native handling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built-in testing framework with component-level unit tests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bazel integration for reproducible, incremental builds&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Immutable Software Deploys Using ZFS Jails on FreeBSD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreeBSD’s native support for ZFS snapshots and jails provides a powerful foundation for immutable deployments. By creating a new jail from a ZFS snapshot for every release, we get instant roll‑backs, zero‑downtime upgrades, and a clean, reproducible environment. This article walks through the (very opinionated) flow that we use. From jails setup through running Caddy as a health‑checked reverse proxy in front of the jails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;1. Prerequisites&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreeBSD 14+ (or the latest stable release) offers the necessary ZFS and jail primitives. Enabling ZFS with a zpool installed allows cheap, instant cloning. The Caddy v2 binary handles TLS, reverse-proxying, and health checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;2. Architecture Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;+--------------------+      +------------------------+      +-------------------+
|                    |      |                        |      |                   |
|   Caddy (reverse   | &amp;lt;-&amp;gt;  |  Immutable Jails       | &amp;lt;-&amp;gt;  |  Application      |
|   proxy &amp;amp; health-  |      |  (ZFS snapshot/clone)  |      |  inside each jail |
|   check)           |      |                        |      |                   |
|                    |      |                        |      |                   |
+--------------------+      +------------------------+      +-------------------+
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Caddy routes to the currently healthy jail.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each deployment clones a ZFS snapshot → new jail.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After passing health‑checks, Caddy reconfigures to the new jail.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;3. Configure the Jails Host Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a new loopback network interface for the jails. We'll use 172.16.0.0/12 which means jails can use any IP address within the range 172.16.0.1 – 172.31.255.254. Then create a new service to manage the loopback interface via a file at '/usr/local/etc/rc.d/lo1' with the following content:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh
# PROVIDE: lo1
# REQUIRE: NETWORKING
# BEFORE:  jail
# KEYWORD: shutdown

. /etc/rc.subr

name="lo1"
command="ifconfig"

start_cmd="${command} ${name} create &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ${command} ${name} inet 172.16.0.1 netmask 255.240.0.0 up"
stop_cmd="${command} ${name} down"

run_rc_command "$1"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then make the service start at boot and enable it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/lo1
sysrc lo1_enable="YES"
service lo1 start
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can go onwards to enabling jails:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sysrc jail_enable="YES"
sysrc jail_parallel_start="YES"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a /etc/jail.conf file with the below configurations so that it includes the configurations for each jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Each jail configuration should be placed in a separate file in '/etc/jail.conf.d/'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;NOTE: The leading '.' before include is required.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.include "/etc/jail.conf.d/*.conf";
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a ZFS dataset mount point and paths for the jails:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;zfs create -o mountpoint=/usr/local/jails zroot/jails
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create child datasets for the jails:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Contains the compressed files of the downloaded userlands.
zfs create zroot/jails/media
# Will contain the templates.
zfs create zroot/jails/templates
# Will contain the containers.
zfs create zroot/jails/containers
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;4. Build the Base Image Template&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the base FreeBSD image and unpack it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Set environment variable for the FreeBSD version. Note that the cut is to remove the patch level.
export FREEBSD_VERSION=$(freebsd-version | cut -d- -f1-2)
zfs create -p zroot/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION
fetch https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/$(uname -m)/$FREEBSD_VERSION/base.txz -o /usr/local/jails/media/$FREEBSD_VERSION-base.txz
tar -xf /usr/local/jails/media/$FREEBSD_VERSION-base.txz -C /usr/local/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION --unlink
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy critical files to the image template:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cp /etc/resolv.conf /usr/local/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION/etc/resolv.conf
cp /etc/localtime /usr/local/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION/etc/localtime
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update the image template to the latest patch level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;freebsd-update -b /usr/local/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION fetch install
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, create a ZFS snapshot of the base image template. From this snapshot we we'll use ZFS clones to create new jails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;zfs snapshot zroot/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION@base
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;5. Create a New Jail&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check which ip addresses on the 'lo1' loopback interface are in use so that we can assign an available ip address to the new jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ifconfig lo1 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lookup the git repo commit hash for the latest commit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git ls-remote https://github.com/yourusername/mygitrepo.git | head
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clone the base image template to create a new jail. We'll be creating a new jail within our git repo path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export FREEBSD_VERSION=$(freebsd-version | cut -d- -f1-2)
export JAIL_NAME=mygitrepo_gitSHA
zfs clone zroot/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION@base zroot/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a config file for the jail to be located at '/etc/jail.conf.d/$JAIL_NAME.conf'.&lt;lb/&gt; We name the jail using the SHA of the git commit that we're deploying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mygitrepo_gitSHA {
	# STARTUP/LOGGING
	exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";
	exec.stop = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";
	exec.consolelog = "/var/log/jail_console_${name}.log";

	# PERMISSIONS
	allow.raw_sockets;
	exec.clean;
	mount.devfs;

	# HOSTNAME/PATH
	host.hostname = "${name}";
	path = "/usr/local/jails/containers/${name}";

	# NETWORK. We're using the lo1 loopback interface that we created for jails to use.
	interface = lo1;
	ip4.addr = 172.16.0.2; # Use an available ip address within the range of the lo1 interface. You can find available ip addresses by running "ifconfig lo1 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'"
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start the jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;service jail start $JAIL_NAME
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirm that the jail's ipaddress is within the range of the lo1 interface:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;jexec $JAIL_NAME ifconfig lo1 | awk '/inet /{print $2}'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirm that the jail is up and what it's running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;jls
jexec $JAIL_NAME ps aux
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;6 Create a Proof of Concept Service Within Our Newly Created Jail&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the proof of concept Go hello world binary that we'll run as a service within the jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// main.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello World!")
	})
	http.HandleFunc("/up", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	})
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build the binary and place it in the jail's bin directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go build main.go
mkdir -p /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/bin
cp main /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/bin/main
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a service file for the binary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh
#
# PROVIDE: main
# REQUIRE: LOGIN
# KEYWORD: shutdown

. /etc/rc.subr

name="main"
rcvar="main_enable"

# Path to your Go binary
command="/usr/local/bin/main"
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"

# Redirect output to a log file
logfile="/var/log/${name}.log"

# How to start the process
start_cmd="${name}_start"
stop_cmd="${name}_stop"

main_start() {
	echo "Starting ${name}..."
	daemon -p "${pidfile}" -f -o "${logfile}" "${command}"
}

main_stop() {
	echo "Stopping ${name}..."
	if [ -f "${pidfile}" ]; then
		kill "$(cat ${pidfile})" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rm -f "${pidfile}"
	else
		echo "No pidfile found; process may not be running."
	fi
}

load_rc_config $name
: ${main_enable:="NO"}

run_rc_command "$1"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy the service file to the jail's /etc/rc.d directory and enable it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir -p /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/etc/rc.d
cp /usr/local/etc/rc.d/main /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/etc/rc.d/main
jexec $JAIL_NAME chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/main
jexec $JAIL_NAME sysrc main_enable=YES
jexec $JAIL_NAME service main start
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setup log rotation so they don't fill up the disk, and do the initial rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;jexec $JAIL_NAME sh -c "echo '/var/log/main.log  root:wheel  644  5  100  *  Z  /var/run/main.pid' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/newsyslog.conf.d/main.conf"
jexec $JAIL_NAME newsyslog -vF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirm the service is running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;jexec $JAIL_NAME service main status
curl 172.16.0.2:8080 # Use the ip address of the jail.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;7 Setup Caddy (reverse proxy)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add a 'service', or similar, group to the system if it doesn't already exist. This group should have permissions to write to the pid and log files. Make sure to use the same group in the next step when we create a user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pw groupadd service
chown root:service /var/run
chown root:service /var/log
chmod 770 /var/run
chmod 770 /var/log
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add a user and assign permissions. Make sure to add the user without login capabilities and assign to the 'service' group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pw useradd caddy -d /nonexistent -s /sbin/nologin -c "Caddy Service Account" -g service
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: We're running Caddy behind a Cloudflare Tunnel on port 8080. If you're not and using a port below 1024 then you'll need to setup security/portacl-rc to enable privileged port binding, and configure for user 'caddy'. This will allow the caddy user to bind to ports below 1024.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;pkg install security/portacl-rc sysrc portacl_users+=caddy sysrc portacl_user_caddy_tcp="http https" sysrc portacl_user_caddy_udp="https" service portacl enable service portacl start&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install Caddy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd /usr/ports/www/caddy
make install clean
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change the ownership of the caddy binary and required files to the caddy user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chown caddy:service /usr/local/bin/caddy
chmod 740 /usr/local/bin/caddy
chown -R caddy:service /var/log/caddy
chown -R caddy:service /usr/local/etc/caddy
chown -R caddy:service /var/db/caddy
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setup log rotation so they don't fill up the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;echo '/var/log/caddy.log  root:wheel  644  5  100  *  Z  /var/run/caddy.pid' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/newsyslog.conf.d/caddy.conf
newsyslog -vF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the caddy service to the system startup and make sure it runs as the caddy user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf caddy_enable="YES"
sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf caddy_user="caddy"
sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf caddy_group="service"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Caddy reads the configuration file at '/usr/local/etc/caddy/Caddyfile'.&lt;lb/&gt; Inside the jail, '/up' returns '200 OK' when healthy.&lt;lb/&gt; Caddy polls the specified health‑check endpoint using the healthcheck directive, routing traffic exclusively to backends that return a successful health check.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Important: We're only disabling automatic HTTPS because we're running behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. If that's not the case, you should enable automatic HTTPS by removing the 'auto_https off' line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# /usr/local/etc/caddy/Caddyfile

	reverse_proxy @serviceB 172.16.0.3:8080 {

	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;8. Deploy a New Jail and Switch Caddy to the New Jail&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a config file for the jail to be located at '/etc/jail.conf.d/$JAIL_NAME.conf'.&lt;lb/&gt; Make sure to replace the ip4.addr variable value with the next available ip address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ifconfig lo1 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mygitrepo_gitSHA {
	# STARTUP/LOGGING
	exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";
	exec.stop = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";
	exec.consolelog = "/var/log/jail_console_${name}.log";

	# PERMISSIONS
	allow.raw_sockets;
	exec.clean;
	mount.devfs;

	# HOSTNAME/PATH
	host.hostname = "${name}";
	path = "/usr/local/jails/containers/${name}";

	# NETWORK. We're using the lo1 loopback interface that we created for jails to use.
	interface = lo1;
	ip4.addr = 172.16.0.3; # Use the ip address we found in the previous step.
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a new jail. We name our jail using the format: mygitrepo_gitSHA. For the repo of the application being deployed. This makes it easy to track which version of the application is running in each jail. The last line is used to confirm the jail is running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git ls-remote https://github.com/yourusername/mygitrepo.git | head
export FREEBSD_VERSION=$(freebsd-version | cut -d- -f1-2)
export JAIL_NAME=mygitrepo_gitSHA
export SERVICE_NAME=conradresearchcom # Note: '-' are not allowed in service names.
zfs clone zroot/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION@base zroot/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME

# Copy the binary of the application to the jail. We'll use our 'main' demo app from previous steps.
go build main.go
mkdir -p /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/bin
cp $SERVICE_NAME /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/bin/$SERVICE_NAME

# Copy the rc.d script to the jail.
mkdir -p /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/etc/rc.d
cp $SERVICE_NAME /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/etc/rc.d/$SERVICE_NAME

# Start the jail.
service jail start $JAIL_NAME
jexec $JAIL_NAME chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/$SERVICE_NAME
jexec $JAIL_NAME sysrc ${SERVICE_NAME}_enable=YES
jexec $JAIL_NAME service $SERVICE_NAME start
while ! curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://172.16.0.3:8080/up; do sleep 1; done
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using your favorite text editor, update the Caddy configuration at '/usr/local/etc/caddy/Caddyfile' to point to the new jail via updating the jail's IP address to the new jail's IP address. Then run the following command to reload Caddy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;service caddy reload
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;9. Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By combining ZFS snapshots, FreeBSD jails, and a Caddy reverse‑proxy, you get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero‑downtime upgrades.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instant rollbacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A predictable environment that can be reproduced at any time.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give it a try, tweak the scripts for your own stack, and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with immutable infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cheers 🥂&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Shutting down our search proxy Leta&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NewsÂ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On November 27, 2025, we will shut down our search proxy, Leta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leta's primary benefit was that it acted as a privacy proxy for search. Pooling and caching requests on behalf of a great number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The search industry continues to undergo big changes. Leta will not be able to follow and will likely become less useful over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar privacy can be achieved through the combination of a VPN and a privacy-focused browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have therefore decided to discontinue Leta and continue to advance the development of state-of-the-art of VPNs and browser privacy - through our own work and research and in collaboration with our partners.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This project is a collection of ROM modifications to get a minimum level of functionality out of a Macintosh Quadra 650/800 / Centris 650 with a 68060 installed on an appropriate adapter. As currently sits it can boot an unmodified System 7.1 install. Much will not work and much work is required to bring into a truly usable state; I do not expect to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a common refrain on the internet that things have gotten worse and are continuing to get worse. There is a proliferation of horrible jumpy loading ads on every website, every search engine throws a crappy AI summary in front of your search result, every site/webapp seems to have gotten slower and slower. I cannot provide a solution for all of that, but I can point to a better paradigm for web site and web app design. That paradigm is local first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local first is a design principle for web apps where the UI and data are co-located and changes to the data are synced with the remote server. Local first apps feel snappy and highly performant because they do not require a network RTT between a users action and rendering the result of the action. I recommend playing around with linear.app to experiene what a first class local first app feels like. I won’t spend much time trying to convince about bad web apps - because if you are ignorant and happy I don’t want to ruin that bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Jira or Github issues you should be able to immediately tell how stark of a difference a local first app can be. Jira is slow because as far as I can tell it is just slow and it loads a lot of data slowly and if you click away and then go back you have to reload all of that same data again. Github is a SSR webapp meaning that the html is generated on the server and then sent to you. This means any interaction usually requires a complete round trip betwen your broswer and the server which is usually very noticeable. Ironically Github’s slow SSR performs much better than Jira in my experience - they do different things but gosh I hate using Jira. I can only hope that some day I’ll be able to use Linear at work and it will be just as fast as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will pause here and just clarify that almost any app architecture can end up being painfully slow if implemented poorly. I would strongly argue that most websites, webapps, etc. that we visit daily are implemented poorly. There a variety of techniques that can be employed in all these different architectures (traditional SPA, SSR, etc) but local first provides the most upside as an architecture when it relates to performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Meme Driven Development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was more serious than I intended it to be so lets dive into some Meme Driven Development (MDD). Let’s get into the main course of this post and talk about Local First HTMX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTMX is… well a meme and also possibly serious, I am not sure if anyone really knows. HTMX is an anti-javascript javascript front end framework/library (idk frontend people use those terms very loosely). More importantly it is a really good meme and that is key to MDD. So I thought I should combine HTMX and local first to create something truly awful yet beautiful. I am not necessarily recommending this approach, but I am excited to share what I’ve done to create the first Local First HTMX Todo app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;HTMX isn’t the right framework but maybe it is&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTMX’s goal to simplify frontend development while still maintaining a good level of interactivity. The geneal idea of HTMX is that your HTML will be rendered by the backend — à la Server Side Rendering. The technical term is hypermedia as the engine of state of HATEOS. If you recall that SSR (needing a RTT to the server for every interaction) has performance issues and can cause websites to feel sluggish (it is hard to fight the speed of light). If you are just sprinkling in interactivity it can work. But and this is the key idea of Local First HTMX - you don’t have to render the HTML on the backend. You can build a “server” and compile it to WASM and run it in the browser. This would give you all the snappiness of a first class Javascript Local First SPA with none of the JS — well less of the JS. The goal is not to avoid JS but to have a simpler app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Architecture Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To recap we are building a Local First HTMX app by compiling our SSR code to WASM and then running that in a service worker. Briefly and possibly incorrectly let me explain a few things about browsers. There is a main thread, this is where your JS and HTML stuff normally happens. The main thread is what has access to the DOM and can actually render content. Browsers have added many features, but I want to mention two. The first is web workers, which lets your run code in a different thread that has limited permissions (no access to the DOM). The second is a service worker - which is like a web worker but has an important disctinction. A service worker can be configured to intercept all fetch requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The service worker can do what it wants with them from proxying them, looking at cache, or handling the request itself. This is what I want to take advantage of - I want to proxy all fetch requests and optionally choose to render HTML and send it back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A basic HTMX request looks something like this&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button hx-post="/clicked"
    hx-trigger="click"
    hx-target="#parent-div"
    hx-swap="outerHTML"
&amp;gt;
    Click Me!
&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally this would send an HTTP request to the sever, but we want to intercept this request in the service worker, handle the request and return HTML. Then in the background the service worker can sync data with the server while maintaining its local data store. In a follow up post I’ll go over the implementation details of how I did this, some issues I encountered, and then talk about some further ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Legal Corner: Apple’s “notarisation” – blocking software freedom of developers and users!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU’s Digital Markets Act is supposed to shake up the power of tech giants by giving developers and users more choice. Apple’s “notarisation” of mobile apps contradicts these objectives. A civil-society complaint against Apple’s monopolistic control over app distribution aims to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims for a structural reset of power in digital markets, a shift from corporate control toward device neutrality, where users decide what runs on their devices. For Free Software, this legislation can be a unique opportunity by finally opening closed ecosystems - like iOS - to Free Software alternatives. Apple has reacted aggressively against the DMA, litigating against regulators, and unfairly excluding Free Software from iOS and iPadOS by blocking the unfettered installation of software (sideloading), prohibiting alternative app stores, and hindering interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FSFE has recently contributed to a complaint initiated by civil-society organisations targeting Apple’s non-compliance with the DMA, urging the European Commission to enforce the DMA’s rules related to interoperability and the app store, giving users and developers effective choice over which apps and app stores they want to use on their devices. This complaint is important for software freedom, contextualising the diverse approaches towards curation of software distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The action taken: calling out the illegality of Apple’s “notarization” of mobile apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are a Free Software developer willing to make your program available in the iPhone. You want to have your software curated in a non-profit Free Software-friendly app store (like F-Droid for Android). This is important for you because you prefer to not have Apple controlling what your software does and to whom it should be made available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all sounds good, until you realise that your plan is not possible in iOS. There is no non-profit Free Software app store available for iPhones and iPads. Apple blocks non-profit app stores with extremely high financial requirements and prohibits unfettered installation of software. Even for the Free Software commercial ones, such as the Alt Store, Apple still applies a complete review and control, through an encryption layer over distributed source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On October 22, ARTICLE 19 and Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte (GFF) filed a complaint against Apple for non-compliance with the DMA to tackle these issues. The complaint highlights the following conduct as illegal under the DMA:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple does not allow the unfettered installation of third-party software (sideloading);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple prevents third-party app stores to effectively running on iOS and iPadOS;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple does not provide effective free-of-charge interoperability with the company’s features controlled via iOS and iPadOS.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of the complaint is twofold:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple’s complete review of apps – known as “notarisation” process - a mandatory step for distributing any software on its platforms, represents the very gatekeeping behaviour the DMA was written to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Notarisation forces all apps, even those distributed outside Apple’s App Store, to be submitted to Apple’s servers for scanning, approval, and cryptographic re-signing before installation. The result is that Apple retains full control over what software users can install and how developers can distribute it. This transforms Apple’s self-appointed “security review” into a choke-point of power, locking in developers and users into the company’s proprietary ecosystem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple’s requirements for third-party app stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Apple has conditioned the provision of a third-party app store as a native app in its iOS and iPadOS on (1) providing a standby letter of credit in the amount of €1,000,000 from a financial institution that is at least A-rated; or (2) being a member of good standing in the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and have an app that had more than 1,000,000 first annual installs on iOS and iPadOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both requirements are extremely unfair and disproportionately affects non-profit Free Software projects, SMEs, startups, and individual developers. This discriminates by size and renders the market inaccessible to smaller new entrants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The implications of Apple’s notarisation for software freedom&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Free Software developers, the implications are even more severe. Apple’s notarisation regime requires developers to hold a paid Apple Developer account, accept restrictive legal terms, and submit binaries to a closed, opaque process. Once approved, the binaries are re-signed by Apple and distributed under digital restriction management (DRM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This breaks users’ rights when it comes to Free Software freedoms. Users can no longer verify that the source code they read corresponds to the binary they run, nor can they freely redistribute software that Apple refuses to notarise. What makes this process absurd is that Apple applies this notarisation process to all apps running on iOS, no matter which channel of distribution. This means that a developer of an alternative app store for iOS has actually no control over the apps they can distribute in their store, as Apple still holds gatekeeping power through notarisation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the DMA, gatekeepers must enable the installation of third-party app stores and refrain from imposing unnecessary technical restrictions. Yet Apple’s notarisation enforces the very dependency the DMA prohibits: it reasserts Apple’s role as the mandatory intermediary for every app on its platforms. This undermines competition, discourages independent developers, and excludes non-commercial, community-run projects that cannot afford to submit to Apple’s terms or refuse to submit to them. Allowing this practice to persist would water down the DMA’s promise before it is even tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Blocking alternative app stores with extremely high requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s requirements for enabling third-party app stores are very hard to meet. They have effectively prevented non-profit Free Software app stores from working in iOS and iPadOS. The provision of a 1 million euro standby letter of credit or 1 million downloads within a year in the EU overburdens not only non-profits, but also individual developers, startups, and SMEs. When these conditions are put into context, such requirements do not reflect industry standards and expectations. They derive from Apple’s monopolistic behaviour with respect to mobile devices. Such impositions do not exist in Apple’s laptops and desktop computers, where unfettered installation (sideloading) is a reality. The complaint concludes that both requirements go beyond the limits of what is necessary under the DMA. Apple ignores less restrictive alternatives (e.g. insurance and escrow frameworks), and provides no justification for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The solution: decentralised software curation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complaint surges the European Commission to impose fines and to find an alternative to Apple’s control over software distribution, including non-profit stakeholders in the process. The alternative to Apple’s notarisation already exists, and it works. Decentralised curation, as practised by repositories like F-Droid, shows that security and software freedom coexist inherently. Instead of concentrating trust in a single private authority, decentralised systems distribute it: through transparent verification pipelines, reproducible builds, and community audits. Users choose whom to trust, and curators are accountable to the public, not to corporate shareholders. This model embodies the DMA’s vision of interoperability and openness far better than Apple’s notarisation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such a model aligns with the DMA’s ambitions: interoperability, transparency, and user choice. Decentralised curation can support multiple overlapping trust networks, from individual developers to NGOs, universities, or public institutions, each maintaining their own repository policies. Instead of “millions of apps” buried in opaque ranking algorithms, users could benefit from clearly defined, community-led collections where the emphasis is on transparency, privacy, and respect for user rights. Security is achieved not through corporate secrecy but through diversity, peer review, and verifiable integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the DMA is to live up to its potential, regulators must treat Apple’s notarisation for what it is: a mechanism of control disguised as a security feature. This civil-society complaint demonstrates that Apple’s understanding of security undermines transparency, competition, and user autonomy - hampering software freedom for everyone. It is not genuine security, it is merely gatekeeping by another name. The European Commission must ensure that compliance with the DMA means genuine openness. The right to install, share, and verify software freely in any device is not merely a technical issue; it is a matter of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 4 Nov 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Making Democracy Work: Fixing and Simplifying Egalitarian Paxos (Extended Version)&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Classical state-machine replication protocols, such as Paxos, rely on a distinguished leader process to order commands. Unfortunately, this approach makes the leader a single point of failure and increases the latency for clients that are not co-located with it. As a response to these drawbacks, Egalitarian Paxos introduced an alternative, leaderless approach, that allows replicas to order commands collaboratively. Not relying on a single leader allows the protocol to maintain non-zero throughput with up to $f$ crashes of any processes out of a total of $n = 2f+1$. The protocol furthermore allows any process to execute a command $c$ fast, in $2$ message delays, provided no more than $e = \lceil\frac{f+1}{2}\rceil$ other processes fail, and all concurrently submitted commands commute with $c$; the latter condition is often satisfied in practical systems.&lt;lb/&gt;Egalitarian Paxos has served as a foundation for many other replication protocols. But unfortunately, the protocol is very complex, ambiguously specified and suffers from nontrivial bugs. In this paper, we present EPaxos* -- a simpler and correct variant of Egalitarian Paxos. Our key technical contribution is a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, which we have rigorously proved correct. Our protocol also generalizes Egalitarian Paxos to cover the whole spectrum of failure thresholds $f$ and $e$ such that $n \ge \max\{2e+f-1, 2f+1\}$ -- the number of processes that we show to be optimal.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s on his sixth prime minister, has watched presidents and princes walk through the black door of No 10, and will soon become the longest continuous resident of Downing Street since Pitt the Younger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The landscape of British politics has changed a lot in the past 15 years, but Larry the cat has remained a reassuring constant. Now his enduring popularity – the like of which some of his temporary owners would kill for – is to feature in a new Channel 4 documentary series exploring Britain’s love of cats. For his fans, the spotlight has been a long time coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Larry’s totally the guy to meet in No 10,” one Westminster source said, adding that – as police officers stationed outside the entry of No 10 who regularly open the door for him will attest – he “has the run of the house”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Larry, whose official title is chief mouser of the Cabinet Office at 10 Downing Street, slunk into the heart of the UK government after being adopted from Battersea Dogs &amp;amp; Cats Home to address a rodent problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His is a rats to riches story to put any schmaltzy political biography to shame. Found as a stray in Wandsworth, he arrived in Westminster in 2011 with David Cameron and Nick Clegg’s coalition government in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If tensions were high between the unlikely governmental bedfellows, Cameron was keen to dispel any animosity between him and the nation’s new favourite feline. “The rumour is I don’t love Larry – I do,” he declared at one PMQs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more established figure now than he was back then, Larry seems to have adjusted to the glare of the spotlight. Often spotted on live broadcasts waiting patiently by the front door, his relaxed demeanour in front of a watching audience has become a nuisance to the the Downing Street gardener – Larry often visits the front flower patch to do his business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His official government page describes the 18-year-old tabby as spending “his days greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defences and testing antique furniture for napping quality” and lists his day-to-day responsibilities as “contemplating a solution to the mouse occupancy of the house”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although he is the first cat to hold his specific title, cats had been welcomed into the corridors of power for at least a century, explained Philip Howell, a professor of geography at the University of Cambridge, who has written extensively about the human-animal relationship. “Stability is an essential part of Larry’s appeal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Larry gives the public some much-needed continuity and nonpartisan continuity at that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Justin Ng, a photographer often present in the press pen outside No 10 who has become firm friends with Larry over the years agrees. He said: “His steadfastness and his unparalleled ability to appear at the right moment and pose for all of us makes him so endearing to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The minute something happens on the street, especially an official visit, like clockwork, he’ll be out the front,” a Downing Street source said. “He loves the red carpet.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The former US president Barack Obama and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, are just some of the world leaders he has charmed. But not all leaders were so enamoured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Theresa May famously hated him because she was a dog person,” said Ng, who has witnessed a few MPs trying, and failing, to stroke Larry (Matt Hancock and David Lammy are on the list).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The former Scotland secretary Ian Murray went as far as to describe Larry as a “little shit” because he refused to pose with the newly minted Labour cabinet, Ng said, adding: “Think Larry has had the last laugh on him.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like all political animals, Larry has experienced public scraps, most, notably with Palmerston, the cat who lived at the Foreign Office until he retired in August 2020. The two could often be seen fighting viciously, said a police officer on duty at No 10. Did police ever intervene? “Oh no, no. You don’t get involved in a cat fight,” the officer said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Larry’s popularity with the public, meanwhile, is undeniable. There are various social media accounts dedicated to the nation’s top mouser, especially the witty Number10Cat X account that has more than 868,000 followers. Larry also receives fan mail, toys and treats from across the world and has recently featured in the journalist and former special adviser Peter Cardwell’s book, Political Animals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he’s not treading the pavements, Larry’s frequent sleeping spots include the printer and in-trays, but his favourite places are on the window sills on either side of the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ng says Larry’s brush and Dreamies are stashed in the Duke of Wellington’s chest of drawers inside the foyer of Downing Street – that much is known to the custodians, civil servants and officers he interacts with daily. Those who feed him or carry treats are Larry’s favourites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As top cat, of course, Larry comes in for his fair share of criticism. The New Statesman’s political editor, Andrew Marr, recently went as far as to call Larry “too fat and too idle to actually do his job”, accusing him of being “welfare dependent”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these times of pre-budget belt tightening, sources close to Larry have issued a stinging rebuke. In fact, they say, Larry is not publicly funded, Downing Street staff voluntarily paying his costs. Fur enough!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
