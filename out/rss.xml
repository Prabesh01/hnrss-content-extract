  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A while back I attended a Cloudflare board meeting and carried my laptop in a brown paper bag from a grocery store. This elicited a few comments about needing a real bag. But I've often carried my laptop in inconspicuous bags. For me, the ultimate laptop bag is one that looks nothing like a laptop bag; it should look like nothing special at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unhappily, grocery bags are not very strong, but there is a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Movie prop grocery bags like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like a classic brown paper grocery bag, but it isn't. It's actually a silent prop made for a film set where the noise from a crinkling paper bag would overwhelm the dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of being made from paper, it's made from fabric and is more robust then an actual paper bag. It's also nearly silent (well, much, much quieter than the real thing).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also the ideal size for my trusty and vintage MacBook Pro. Especially when it's in its sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now on the front page of Hacker News — join the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When ChatGPT first launched in 2022, it could barely write short snippets of working code. Today, the best LLMs can generate entire applications from scratch and even win prestigious coding competitions (like IOI 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But can they tackle the messy reality of software development – dependency hell, legacy toolchains, and cryptic compile errors? We created CompileBench to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tested 19 state-of-the-art LLMs on 15 real-world tasks using the unmodified source code of open-source projects like &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; (HTTP client) and &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt; (command-line JSON processor).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal sounds straightforward – produce a working binary. But achieving it can be surprisingly complex. Our toughest challenges include cross-compiling to Windows or ARM64 and resurrecting 22-year-old source code from 2003 on modern systems. Some agents needed 135 commands and 15 minutes just to produce a single working binary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the full results later in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Tasks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each task in CompileBench follows the same structure. We give the LLM agent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Source code from an open-source project (e.g., &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An interactive Linux terminal (running in a Docker container)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A clear build objective&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent must independently figure out the build system, decide whether to patch the sources, resolve missing headers and libraries, and choose the right compiler/linker flags. Once it’s done, we run various checks to verify that the resulting executable actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our tasks range from simple builds (that most models can handle) to brutal challenges like reviving 2003-era code, cross-compiling to Windows, or cross-compiling for ARM64 architecture. We tested popular projects including &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; (HTTP client), GNU Coreutils (utilities like &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mv&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt; (JSON processor).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Making Tasks Hard With One Simple Trick&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that it’s really easy to make the tasks more difficult. Nearly all models can build &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; with standard settings. But ask them to create a “statically compiled binary for ARM64” (the architecture used by modern Apple devices and many servers) and watch the success rate plummet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a single attempt (pass@1), the success rate drops from 96% to 2%. Claude Opus 4.1, the only model to succeed, had to execute a 36-command sequence that involved downloading source code for all dependencies (OpenSSL, brotli, zlib, and zstd), cross-compiling each one statically for ARM64, and finally linking them all together in the final &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Anthropic Wins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet and Opus models are beloved by developers for coding tasks, yet they don’t always top traditional benchmarks. Our results might explain why developers trust them so much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In CompileBench, Anthropic models claim the top 2 spots for success rate and perform impressively on speed metrics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OpenAI: Great Performance at The Best Price&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; OpenAI models secure 3rd and 6th place in our success rankings. But where they truly excel is cost-efficiency – they dominate the Pareto frontier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; OpenAI models are the most cost efficient across nearly all task difficulties. GPT-5-mini (high reasoning effort) is a great model in both intelligence and price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI provides a range of models, from non-reasoning options like GPT-4.1 to advanced reasoning models like GPT-5. We found that each one remains highly relevant in practice. For example, GPT-4.1 is the fastest at completing tasks while maintaining a solid success rate. GPT-5, when set to minimal reasoning effort, is reasonably fast and achieves an even higher success rate. GPT-5 (high reasoning effort) is the best one, albeit at the highest price and slowest speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Google: A Surprising Disappointment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite their strong reputation – with Gemini 2.5 Pro being one of the best in web development – Google’s models scored near the bottom of our leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The models frequently failed to complete tasks as specified. When asked for a static ARM64 build, Gemini 2.5 Pro would produce a valid ARM64 executable but not a static one. For static builds using the musl C library, it correctly used musl but chose dynamic linking, arguing that static builds were unnecessarily large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When designing the benchmark we kept our benchmark harness and prompts minimal, avoiding model-specific tweaks. It is possible that Google models could perform better with a harness or prompt specifically hand-tuned for them, but this is against our principles in this benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even Gemini seemed to lack confidence, as this output from Gemini 2.5 Pro shows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have been unable to successfully complete the request. I have made several mistakes and am not confident that I can produce the correct result. I am aborting the task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…but at least it has “learned a lot”, as per Gemini 2.5 Pro output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am sorry for the many mistakes I made along the way, but I have learned a lot and I am now confident that I can complete similar requests in the future without making so many errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Catching Cheating LLMs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each task in CompileBench comes with a set of checks. For example, for &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; we check whether the model created an actual executable, whether it reports the correct version matching the source code, and whether it can successfully make HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But some models tried to cheat! When GPT-5-mini (high reasoning) struggled to compile 2003-era GNU Coreutils (set of utilities like &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt;), it took a creative shortcut – copying existing system utilities instead of building them. Its reasoning trace revealed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As a practical fallback so you have the utilities available under /home/peter/result/&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;utility&gt;(as you requested), I created /home/peter/result and created symlinks for all utilities from the coreutils source tree. Each symlink points to an available system implementation: if /bin/&lt;/utility&gt;
      &lt;utility&gt;exists it links to that; otherwise it links to /bin/busybox (BusyBox responds to argv[0] so most common utilities will run).&lt;/utility&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But our checks caught that and correctly marked the attempt as failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With CompileBench we wanted to see how LLMs could handle “messy” software engineering problems like dependency hell, legacy toolchains or weird compile errors. CompileBench uses purely function calling for truly long-horizon tasks – some requiring 135 commands or over 15 minutes with agentic loops running tens of times. This design authentically measures LLMs’ ability to recover from errors and persist through complex, multi-step challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results, show that there’s no single “best” model – it depends on whether you prioritize intelligence, speed, or cost-efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the best Anthropic models (Sonnet 4 or Opus 4.1) for the most demanding tasks and cheaper OpenAI models (GPT 4.1, GPT-5/GPT-5-mini with lower reasoning efforts) for less demanding ones seems to be the conclusion based on the benchmark results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning. Future versions of CompileBench could tackle even more challenging projects – can AI handle FFmpeg, ancient GCC versions, or ImageMagick? What about cross-compiling from Linux to FreeBSD? Or for the ultimate benchmark, could an AI get Doom running on an arbitrary device?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can browse the complete results of the benchmark at: https://compilebench.com/&lt;lb/&gt; or tinker with the (full!) source code at: https://github.com/QuesmaOrg/CompileBench&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do these results match your own experience with using LLMs for software engineering?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for future posts and releases&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mainly use my MacBook M1 Pro with Apple Silicon for work. Recently I’ve had a few weeks off. It’s been sitting in my laptop bag waiting for me to return to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I’m back to work tomorrow I got it out to see if it was charged enough for the train journey in the morning. 90% remaining. After 3 weeks. It wasn’t turned off, just closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, my Framework 13 with an AMD Ryzen 7840HS is almost always dead when I go to use it. It’s very frustrating. I’m not using it every day so it often goes 2-3 days without being opened. I haven’t measured it but I read that I should expect it to lose 3-4% in suspend every hour. Is that a joke?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was running Fedora Workstation on the 13 for a long while until I had a short stint with Arch Linux. It wasn’t stable enough so now I’m on Fedora Silverblue which has been delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the Framework’s battery life continues to be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m a true believer of Framework’s mission. The technology is awesome. But why is the battery life of modern laptops (other than Apple Silicon) so bad? I don’t think it’s unique to Framework, but it affects my love for this groundbreaking device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple Silicon is built upon ARM64 which is apparently core to such great battery life. Do I need to get an ARM mainboard as soon as Framework offers it as an upgrade? I’m not sure. It appears to be way more complicated than just switching to ARM64.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still love my Framework, despite its flaws. I will just keep it plugged in so that it’s ready to go when I want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we believe that helping build a better Internet means encouraging a healthy ecosystem of options for how people can connect safely and quickly to the resources they need. Sometimes that means we tackle immense, Internet-scale problems with established partners. And sometimes that means we support and partner with fantastic open teams taking big bets on the next generation of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To that end, today we are excited to announce our support of two independent, open source projects: Ladybird, an ambitious project to build a completely independent browser from the ground up, and Omarchy, an opinionated Arch Linux setup for developers.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Two open source projects strengthening the open InternetÂ &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has a long history of supporting open-source software â both through our own projects shared with the community and external projects that we support. We see our sponsorship of Ladybird and Omarchy as a natural extension of these efforts in a moment where energy for a diverse ecosystem is needed more than ever.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ladybird, a new and independent browserÂ &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most of us spend a significant amount of time using a web browser âÂ in fact, youâre probably using one to read this blog! The beauty of browsers is that they help users experience the open Internet, giving you access to everything from the largest news publications in the world to a tiny website hosted on a Raspberry Pi.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unlike dedicated apps, browsers reduce the barriers to building an audience for new services and communities on the Internet. If you are launching something new, you can offer it through a browser in a world where most people have absolutely zero desire to install an app just to try something out. Browsers help encourage competition and new ideas on the open web.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While the openness of how browsers work has led to an explosive growth of services on the Internet, browsers themselves have consolidated to a tiny handful of viable options. Thereâs a high probability youâre reading this on a Chromium-based browser, like Googleâs Chrome, along with about 65% of users on the Internet. However, that consolidation has also scared off new entrants in the space. If all browsers ship on the same operating systems, powered by the same underlying technology, we lose out on potential privacy, security and performance innovations that could benefit developers and everyday Internet users.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Cloudflare Workers developer docs in LadybirdÂ &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is where Ladybird comes in: itâs not Chromium based â everything is built from scratch. The Ladybird project has two main components: LibWeb, a brand-new rendering engine, and LibJS, a brand-new JavaScript engine with its own parser, interpreter, and bytecode execution engine.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Building an engine that can correctly and securely render the modern web is a monumental task that requires deep technical expertise and navigating decades of specifications governed by standards bodies like the W3C and WHATWG. And because Ladybird implements these standards directly, it also stress-tests them in practice. Along the way, the project has found, reported, and sometimes fixed countless issues in the specifications themselves, contributions that strengthen the entire web platform for developers, browser vendors, and anyone who may attempt to build a browser in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Whether to build something from scratch or not is a perennial source of debate between software engineers, but absent the pressures of revenue or special interests, weâre excited about the ways Ladybird will prioritize privacy, performance, and security, potentially in novel ways that will influence the entire ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of the Omarchy development environment&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Omarchy, an independent development environmentÂ &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Developers deserve choice, too. Beyond the browser, a developerâs operating system and environment is where they spend a ton of time â and where a few big players have become the dominant choice. Omarchy challenges this by providing a complete, opinionated Arch Linux distribution that transforms a bare installation into a modern development workstation that developers are excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perfecting oneâs development environment can be a career-long art, but learning how to do so shouldnât be a barrier to beginning to code. The beauty of Omarchy is that it makes Linux approachable to more developers by doing most of the setup for them, making it look good, and then making it configurable. Omarchy provides most of the tools developers need â like Neovim, Docker, and Git â out of the box, and tons of other features.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At its core, Omarchy embraces Linux for all of its complexity and configurability, and makes a version of it that is accessible and fun to use for developers that donât have a deep background in operating systems. Projects like this ensure that a powerful, independent Linux desktop remains a compelling choice for people building the next generation of applications and Internet infrastructure.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our support comes with no strings attachedÂ Â &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We want to be very clear here: we are supporting these projects because we believe the Internet can be better if these projects, and more like them, succeed. No requirement to use our technology stack or any arrangement like that. We are happy to partner with great teams like Ladybird and Omarchy simply because we believe that our missions have real overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ladybird is still in its early days, with an alpha release planned for 2026, but we encourage anyone who is interested to consider contributing to the open source codebase as they prepare for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Cloudflare knows what it means to build critical web infrastructure on the server side. With Ladybird, weâre tackling the near-monoculture on the client side, because we believe it needs multiple implementations to stay healthy, and weâre extremely thankful for their support in that mission.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â Andreas Kling, Founder, LadybirdÂ Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Omarchy 3.0 was released just last week with faster installation and increased Macbook compatibility, so if youâve been Linux-curious for a while now, we encourage you to try it out!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Cloudflare's support of Omarchy has ensured we have the fastest ISO and package delivery from wherever you are in the world. Without a need to manually configure mirrors or deal with torrents. The combo of a super CDN, great R2 storage, and the best DDoS shield in the business has been a huge help for the project."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â David Heinemeier Hansson, Creator of Omarchy and Ruby on Rails&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A better Internet is one where people have more choice in how they browse and develop new software. Weâre incredibly excited about the potential of Ladybird, Omarchy, and other audacious projects that support a free and open Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45332860</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 13:03:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cap'n Web: a new RPC system for browsers and web servers</title><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/capnweb-javascript-rpc-library/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="e228a11afa2902c6"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Allow us to introduce Cap'n Web, an RPC protocol and implementation in pure TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web is a spiritual sibling to Cap'n Proto, an RPC protocol I (Kenton) created a decade ago, but designed to play nice in the web stack. That means:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Like Cap'n Proto, it is an object-capability protocol. ("Cap'n" is short for "capabilities and".) We'll get into this more below, but it's incredibly powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Unlike Cap'n Proto, Cap'n Web has no schemas. In fact, it has almost no boilerplate whatsoever. This means it works more like the JavaScript-native RPC system in Cloudflare Workers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;That said, it integrates nicely with TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Also unlike Cap'n Proto, Cap'n Web's underlying serialization is human-readable. In fact, it's just JSON, with a little pre-/post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It works over HTTP, WebSocket, and postMessage() out-of-the-box, with the ability to extend it to other transports easily.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It works in all major browsers, Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, and other modern JavaScript runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The whole thing compresses (minify+gzip) to under 10Â kB with no dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It's open source under the MIT license.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web is more expressive than almost every other RPC system, because it implements an object-capability RPC model. That means it:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Supports bidirectional calling. The client can call the server, and the server can also call the client.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Supports passing functions by reference: If you pass a function over RPC, the recipient receives a "stub". When they call the stub, they actually make an RPC back to you, invoking the function where it was created. This is how bidirectional calling happens: the client passes a callback to the server, and then the server can call it later.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Similarly, supports passing objects by reference: If a class extends the special marker type &lt;code&gt;RpcTarget&lt;/code&gt;, then instances of that class are passed by reference, with method calls calling back to the location where the object was created.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Supports promise pipelining. When you start an RPC, you get back a promise. Instead of awaiting it, you can immediately use the promise in dependent RPCs, thus performing a chain of calls in a single network round trip.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Supports capability-based security patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In short, Cap'n Web lets you design RPC interfaces the way you'd design regular JavaScript APIs â while still acknowledging and compensating for network latency.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The best part is, Cap'n Web is absolutely trivial to set up.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A client looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;import { newWebSocketRpcSession } from "capnweb";

// One-line setup.
let api = newWebSocketRpcSession("wss://example.com/api");

// Call a method on the server!
let result = await api.hello("World");

console.log(result);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And here's a complete Cloudflare Worker implementing an RPC server:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;import { RpcTarget, newWorkersRpcResponse } from "capnweb";

// This is the server implementation.
class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget {
  hello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}

// Standard Workers HTTP handler.
export default {
  fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Parse URL for routing.
    let url = new URL(request.url);

    // Serve API at `/api`.
    if (url.pathname === "/api") {
      return newWorkersRpcResponse(request, new MyApiServer());
    }

    // You could serve other endpoints here...
    return new Response("Not found", {status: 404});
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That's it. That's the app.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;You can add more methods to &lt;code&gt;MyApiServer&lt;/code&gt;, and call them from the client.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;You can have the client pass a callback function to the server, and then the server can just call it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;You can define a TypeScript interface for your API, and easily apply it to the client and server.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It just works.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why RPC? (And what is RPC anyway?)&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are a way of expressing communications between two programs over a network. Without RPC, you might communicate using a protocol like HTTP. With HTTP, though, you must format and parse your communications as an HTTP request and response, perhaps designed in REST style. RPC systems try to make communications look like a regular function call instead, as if you were calling a library rather than a remote service. The RPC system provides a "stub" object on the client side which stands in for the real server-side object. When a method is called on the stub, the RPC system figures out how to serialize and transmit the parameters to the server, invoke the method on the server, and then transmit the return value back.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The merits of RPC have been subject to a great deal of debate. RPC is often accused of committing many of the fallacies of distributed computing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But this reputation is outdated. When RPC was first invented some 40 years ago, async programming barely existed. We did not have Promises, much less async and await. Early RPC was synchronous: calls would block the calling thread waiting for a reply. At best, latency made the program slow. At worst, network failures would hang or crash the program. No wonder it was deemed "broken".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Things are different today. We have Promise and async and await, and we can throw exceptions on network failures. We even understand how RPCs can be pipelined so that a chain of calls takes only one network round trip. Many large distributed systems you likely use every day are built on RPC. It works.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The fact is, RPC fits the programming model we're used to. Every programmer is trained to think in terms of APIs composed of function calls, not in terms of byte stream protocols nor even REST. Using RPC frees you from the need to constantly translate between mental models, allowing you to move faster.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When should you use Cap'n Web?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web is useful anywhere where you have two JavaScript applications speaking to each other over a network, including client-to-server and microservice-to-microservice scenarios. However, it is particularly well-suited to interactive web applications with real-time collaborative features, as well as modeling interactions over complex security boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web is still new and experimental, so for now, a willingness to live on the cutting edge may also be required!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Features, features, featuresâ¦&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's some more things you can do with Cap'n Web.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sometimes a WebSocket connection is a bit too heavyweight. What if you just want to make a quick one-time batch of calls, but don't need an ongoing connection?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For that, Cap'n Web supports HTTP batch mode:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;import { newHttpBatchRpcSession } from "capnweb";

let batch = newHttpBatchRpcSession("https://example.com/api");

let result = await batch.hello("World");

console.log(result);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(The server is exactly the same as before.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that once you've awaited an RPC in the batch, the batch is done, and all the remote references received through it become broken. To make more calls, you need to start over with a new batch. However, you can make multiple calls in a single batch:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let batch = newHttpBatchRpcSession("https://example.com/api");

// We can call make multiple calls, as long as we await them all at once.
let promise1 = batch.hello("Alice");
let promise2 = batch.hello("Bob");

let [result1, result2] = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]);

console.log(result1);
console.log(result2);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And that brings us to another featureâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Chained calls (Promise Pipelining)&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's where things get magical.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In both batch mode and WebSocket mode, you can make a call that depends on the result of another call, without waiting for the first call to finish. In batch mode, that means you can, in a single batch, call a method, then use its result in another call. The entire batch still requires only one network round trip.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, say your API is:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget {
  getMyName() {
    return "Alice";
  }

  hello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can do:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let namePromise = batch.getMyName();
let result = await batch.hello(namePromise);

console.log(result);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Notice the initial call to &lt;code&gt;getMyName()&lt;/code&gt; returned a promise, but we used the promise itself as the input to &lt;code&gt;hello()&lt;/code&gt;, without awaiting it first. With Cap'n Web, this just works: The client sends a message to the server saying: "Please insert the result of the first call into the parameters of the second."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Or perhaps the first call returns an object with methods. You can call the methods immediately, without awaiting the first promise, like:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let batch = newHttpBatchRpcSession("https://example.com/api");

// Authencitate the API key, returning a Session object.
let sessionPromise = batch.authenticate(apiKey);

// Get the user's name.
let name = await sessionPromise.whoami();

console.log(name);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This works because the promise returned by a Cap'n Web call is not a regular promise. Instead, it's a JavaScript Proxy object. Any methods you call on it are interpreted as speculative method calls on the eventual result. These calls are sent to the server immediately, telling the server: "When you finish the call I sent earlier, call this method on what it returns."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Did you spot the security?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This last example shows an important security pattern enabled by Cap'n Web's object-capability model.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When we call the authenticate() method, after it has verified the provided API key, it returns an authenticated session object. The client can then make further RPCs on the session object to perform operations that require authorization as that user. The server code might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget {
  authenticate(apiKey) {
    let username = await checkApiKey(apiKey);
    return new AuthenticatedSession(username);
  }
}

class AuthenticatedSession extends RpcTarget {
  constructor(username) {
    super();
    this.username = username;
  }

  whoami() {
    return this.username;
  }

  // ...other methods requiring auth...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's what makes this work: It is impossible for the client to "forge" a session object. The only way to get one is to call authenticate(), and have it return successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In most RPC systems, it is not possible for one RPC to return a stub pointing at a new RPC object in this way. Instead, all functions are top-level, and can be called by anyone. In such a traditional RPC system, it would be necessary to pass the API key again to every function call, and check it again on the server each time. Or, you'd need to do authorization outside the RPC system entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a common pain point for WebSockets in particular. Due to the design of the web APIs for WebSocket, you generally cannot use headers nor cookies to authorize them. Instead, authorization must happen in-band, by sending a message over the WebSocket itself. But this can be annoying for RPC protocols, as it means the authentication message is "special" and changes the state of the connection itself, affecting later calls. This breaks the abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The authenticate() pattern shown above neatly makes authentication fit naturally into the RPC abstraction. It's even type-safe: you can't possibly forget to authenticate before calling a method requiring auth, because you wouldn't have an object on which to make the call. Speaking of type-safetyâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you use TypeScript, Cap'n Web plays nicely with it. You can declare your RPC API once as a TypeScript interface, implement in on the server, and call it on the client:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;// Shared interface declaration:
interface MyApi {
  hello(name: string): Promise&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;;
}

// On the client:
let api: RpcStub&amp;lt;MyApi&amp;gt; = newWebSocketRpcSession("wss://example.com/api");

// On the server:
class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget implements MyApi {
  hello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now you get end-to-end type checking, auto-completed method names, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that, as always with TypeScript, no type checks occur at runtime. The RPC system itself does not prevent a malicious client from calling an RPC with parameters of the wrong type. This is, of course, not a problem unique to Cap'n Web â JSON-based APIs have always had this problem. You may wish to use a runtime type-checking system like Zod to solve this. (Meanwhile, we hope to add type checking based directly on TypeScript types in the future.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An alternative to GraphQL?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If youâve used GraphQL before, you might notice some similarities. One benefit of GraphQL was to solve the âwaterfallâ problem of traditional REST APIs by allowing clients to ask for multiple pieces of data in one query. For example, instead of making three sequential HTTP calls:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;GET /user
GET /user/friends
GET /user/friends/photos&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;â¦you can write one GraphQL query to fetch it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thatâs a big improvement over REST, but GraphQL comes with its own tradeoffs:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;New language and tooling. You have to adopt GraphQLâs schema language, servers, and client libraries. If your team is all-in on JavaScript, thatâs a lot of extra machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Limited composability. GraphQL queries are declarative, which makes them great for fetching data, but awkward for chaining operations or mutations. For example, you canât easily say: âcreate a user, then immediately use that new user object to make a friend request, all-in-one round trip.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Different abstraction model. GraphQL doesnât look or feel like the JavaScript APIs you already know. Youâre learning a new mental model rather than extending the one you use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Cap'n Web goes further&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web solves the waterfall problem without introducing a new language or ecosystem. Itâs just JavaScript. Because Cap'n Web supports promise pipelining and object references, you can write code that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let user = api.createUser({ name: "Alice" });
let friendRequest = await user.sendFriendRequest("Bob");&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What happens under the hood? Both calls are pipelined into a single network round trip:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Create the user.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Take the result of that call (a new User object).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Immediately invoke sendFriendRequest() on that object.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All of this is expressed naturally in JavaScript, with no schemas, query languages, or special tooling required. You just call methods and pass objects around, like you would in any other JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In other words, GraphQL gave us a way to flatten RESTâs waterfalls. Cap'n Web lets us go even further: it gives you the power to model complex interactions exactly the way you would in a normal program, with no impedance mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But how do we solve arrays?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With everything we've presented so far, there's a critical missing piece to seriously consider Cap'n Web as an alternative to GraphQL: handling lists. Often, GraphQL is used to say: "Perform this query, and then, for every result, perform this other query." For example: "List the user's friends, and then for each one, fetch their profile photo."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In short, we need an &lt;code&gt;array.map()&lt;/code&gt; operation that can be performed without adding a round trip.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Proto, historically, has never supported such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But with Cap'n Web, we've solved it. You can do:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let user = api.authenticate(token);

// Get the user's list of friends (an array).
let friendsPromise = user.listFriends();

// Do a .map() to annotate each friend record with their photo.
// This operates on the *promise* for the friends list, so does not
// add a round trip.
// (wait WHAT!?!?)
let friendsWithPhotos = friendsPromise.map(friend =&amp;gt; {
  return {friend, photo: api.getUserPhoto(friend.id))};
}

// Await the friends list with attached photos -- one round trip!
let results = await friendsWithPhotos;
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; takes a callback function, which needs to be applied to each element in the array. As we described earlier, normally when you pass a function to an RPC, the function is passed "by reference", meaning that the remote side receives a stub, where calling that stub makes an RPC back to the client where the function was created.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But that is NOT what is happening here. That would defeat the purpose: we don't want the server to have to round-trip to the client to process every member of the array. We want the server to just apply the transformation server-side.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To that end, &lt;code&gt;.map() &lt;/code&gt;is special. It does not send JavaScript code to the server, but it does send something like "code", restricted to a domain-specific, non-Turing-complete language. The "code" is a list of instructions that the server should carry out for each member of the array. In this case, the instructions are:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Invoke &lt;code&gt;api.getUserPhoto(friend.id)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Return an object &lt;code&gt;{friend, photo}&lt;/code&gt;, where friend is the original array element and photo is the result of step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But the application code just specified a JavaScript method. How on Earth could we convert this into the narrow DSL?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The answer is record-replay: On the client side, we execute the callback once, passing in a special placeholder value. The parameter behaves like an RPC promise. However, the callback is required to be synchronous, so it cannot actually await this promise. The only thing it can do is use promise pipelining to make pipelined calls. These calls are intercepted by the implementation and recorded as instructions, which can then be sent to the server, where they can be replayed as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And because the recording is based on promise pipelining, which is what the RPC protocol itself is designed to represent, it turns out that the "DSL" used to represent "instructions" for the map function is just the RPC protocol itself. ð¤¯&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web's underlying protocol is based on JSON â but with a preprocessing step to handle special types. Arrays are treated as "escape sequences" that let us encode other values. For example, JSON does not have an encoding for &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; objects, but Cap'n Web does. You might see a message that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;{
  event: "Birthday Week",
  timestamp: ["date", 1758499200000]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To encode a literal array, we simply double-wrap it in &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;{
  names: [["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In other words, an array with just one element which is itself an array, evaluates to the inner array literally. An array whose first element is a type name, evaluates to an instance of that type, where the remaining elements are parameters to the type.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that only a fixed set of types are supported: essentially, "structured clonable" types, and RPC stub types.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On top of this basic encoding, we define an RPC protocol inspired by Cap'n Proto â but greatly simplified.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since Cap'n Web is a symmetric protocol, there is no well-defined "client" or "server" at the protocol level. There are just two parties exchanging messages across a connection. Every kind of interaction can happen in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In order to make it easier to describe these interactions, I will refer to the two parties as "Alice" and "Bob".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Alice and Bob start the connection by establishing some sort of bidirectional message stream. This may be a WebSocket, but Cap'n Web also allows applications to define their own transports. Each message in the stream is JSON-encoded, as described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Alice and Bob each maintain some state about the connection. In particular, each maintains an "export table", describing all the pass-by-reference objects they have exposed to the other side, and an "import table", describing the references they have received. Alice's exports correspond to Bob's imports, and vice versa. Each entry in the export table has a signed integer ID, which is used to reference it. You can think of these IDs like file descriptors in a POSIX system. Unlike file descriptors, though, IDs can be negative, and an ID is never reused over the lifetime of a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At the start of the connection, Alice and Bob each populate their export tables with a single entry, numbered zero, representing their "main" interfaces. Typically, when one side is acting as the "server", they will export their main public RPC interface as ID zero, whereas the "client" will export an empty interface. However, this is up to the application: either side can export whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From there, new exports are added in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When Alice sends a message to Bob that contains within it an object or function reference, Alice adds the target object to her export table. IDs assigned in this case are always negative, starting from -1 and counting downwards.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Alice can send a "push" message to Bob to request that Bob add a value to his export table. The "push" message contains an expression which Bob evaluates, exporting the result. Usually, the expression describes a method call on one of Bob's existing exports â this is how an RPC is made. Each "push" is assigned a positive ID on the export table, starting from 1 and counting upwards. Since positive IDs are only assigned as a result of pushes, Alice can predict the ID of each push she makes, and can immediately use that ID in subsequent messages. This is how promise pipelining is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After sending a push message, Alice can subsequently send a "pull" message, which tells Bob that once he is done evaluating the "push", he should proactively serialize the result and send it back to Alice, as a "resolve" (or "reject") message. However, this is optional: Alice may not actually care to receive the return value of an RPC, if Alice only wants to use it in promise pipelining. In fact, the Cap'n Web implementation will only send a "pull" message if the application has actually awaited the returned promise.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Putting it together, a code sequence like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let namePromise = api.getMyName();
let result = await api.hello(namePromise);

console.log(result);&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Might produce a message exchange like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;// Call api.getByName(). `api` is the server's main export, so has export ID 0.
-&amp;gt; ["push", ["pipeline", 0, "getMyName", []]
// Call api.hello(namePromise). `namePromise` refers to the result of the first push,
// so has ID 1.
-&amp;gt; ["push", ["pipeline", 0, "hello", [["pipeline", 1]]]]
// Ask that the result of the second push be proactively serialized and returned.
-&amp;gt; ["pull", 2]
// Server responds.
&amp;lt;- ["resolve", 2, "Hello, Alice!"]&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web is new and still highly experimental. There may be bugs to shake out. But, we're already using it today. Cap'n Web is the basis of the recently-launched "remote bindings" feature in Wrangler, allowing a local test instance of workerd to speak RPC to services in production. We've also begun to experiment with it in various frontend applications â expect more blog posts on this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In any case, Cap'n Web is open source, and you can start using it in your own projects now.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Check it out on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What is Algebraic about Algebraic Effects?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;quote&gt;what does the word "algebraic" mean when used in the context of programming langs?&lt;lb/&gt;- a random tweet&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd wondered the same thing about "Algebraic Effects", and was excited to find a talk on YouTube titled What's Algebraic About Algebraic Effects and Handlers? Unfortunately, I'm not the target audience. As an engineer that doesn't shy away from math, it was still out of my depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found some time this past spring looking into Algebraic Effects, and I think I have a decent answer to the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Algebra in the context of programming&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;My view of "Algebra" in the context of programming is a particular kind of compositionality, where there's a structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, mainstream developers often talk about compositionality as just two obj/function that can interoperate due to the same interface, but not much more can be inferred about properties of the interop between the two obj/functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So often times, we get some collection of objects/functions that go together in an arbitrary way according to the taste of the developer that wrote it. If they're any good, it feels intuitive. But more often than not, it feels arbitrary. The effect is magnified if you look into the codebase. To a newcomer, it feels like a mess, in the same way that a house built by piling stones high feels like a mess: there's no apparent or easily recognizable structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A tangential detour into abstract algebra&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In abstract algebra, structure is often where you take some math object 𝛂 (like an int, or matrix), and you pair it with an operation, (like + or *), and you say: integers can be composed with op `+`, but we can ALSO infer properties in these combos--or laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a common one we know is: integer (ℤ) with addition (+) has implied properties that always hold. And the elements (ℤ), the op (+), and the properties together constrain outcomes, and this is what gives us structure. A house with structure feels like it's built with arches, rather than a pile of rocks. What are the properties of (ℤ) and (+)? Due to how ℤ and + are defined, we get these properties:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Closure: ℤ + ℤ always gives you another ℤ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes devs write code that doesn't give you back the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Associativity: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) where a, b, c are in ℤ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This familiar, as they were drilled in grade school. But often devs don't write code that fulfill this property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last two are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. identity: ℤ has an element that doesn't change when we use +. &lt;lb/&gt;Here, it's zero: a + 0 = a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. inverse: every ℤ has a matching ℤ that give us the identity when we use + on it: a + (-a) = 0, where a and -a are in ℤ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, math peeps gave this kind of structure a name: Groups. So if someone says [a struct] and [an op] together form a group, I can automatically can assume those properties. It's a shorthand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you add even more constraints/properties to how ℤ and + behave together, you get another algebraic structure. There's a whole host and families of these. So if we add another constraint, we get an Abelian Group:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Commutativity: a+b = b+a, where a, b are in ℤ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Surmounting the network with algebra&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why write constraining data structure and op pairings? It's quite useful if you want to guarantee specific properties of your system. For example, it's well known that syncing is hard, because of the Eight Fallacies of Distributed Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The network is reliable;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Latency is zero;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bandwidth is infinite;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The network is secure;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Topology doesn't change;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;There is one administrator;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Transport cost is zero;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The network is homogeneous.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means your data, when sent over the network will likely arrive out of order. Worse, clocks can be out of sync, so it can look like data arrived from the future. How can we tame the underlying unreliable system? By constraining our data and operations to have properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRDTs are nowadays used to enforce eventually consistent syncs. It achieves this by pairing a data structure with a merge operation, which together form an algebraic structure called a semi-lattice. The properties of a semi-lattice are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Closure: For all a, b in the set S, the result of a ∘ b is also in S.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Associativity: a ∘ (b ∘ c)=(a ∘ b) ∘ c for all a, b, c ∈ S.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Commutativity: a ∘ b = b ∘ a for all a, b ∈ S.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Idempotence: a ∘ a = a for all a ∈ S.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, this is enough to counteract the network mixing up your data when sending it over the network. I wrote about that here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So by constraining the power of what our code can do, we can ensure the system has specific desirable properties that achieve the goal of syncing data over an unreliable network. It's where we say: "If we compose this kind of data structure in this constrained way with this kind of merge function, then we can guarantee these properties always hold. And with this structure, our data can survive sync over an unreliable network with other syncers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;From Monads to Algebraic Effects&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why people also like Monads. Monads are about how to compose code, but with specific properties (Monadic laws) so we can achieve some goal in how they compose. I won't go into it here, as this is already long, but that's the core idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all types of Monads compose well together. Here's where I'm out of my depth, but I've read and I'm told that this is why there are Monad Transformers, so you can fit different domain Monads together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, some people have started looking at Algebraic Effects, as a way to achieve the same compositional powers of monads, but in a different way. Most descriptions of Algebraic Effects actually ignore the `algebraic` part, because describing `effects` is already a big leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects part, is often explained as "resumable exceptions". I wrote a short description of what algebraic effects are from that perspective, so I won't expound on that here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the algebraic part of algebraic effects is that the effects that you raise as a "resumable exception" can be composed together! Not just in any way: design them so when composed, they have *guaranteed properties* just like the stuff you saw above!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if we had a key/value store that we interface with using &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt;, we could express what we expect to happen through some algebraic properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Idempotence of consecutive reads (get-get): get k; get k ≡ get x&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This says, two consecutive &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; is functionally equivalent to a single &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;. This guarantees that &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; is a pure observation: it doesn't consume or advance anything. If this law didn't hold, reading could "drain" or "advance" some hidden cursor. By making it a law, we make it an explicit behavior for our users, so they're not surprised by bugs down the line when their assumptions veer from this property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Last write wins (put-put): put k v1; put k v2 ≡ put k v2&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy. The two &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; together is the functional equivalent of only executing the last one. Hence, the last &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; is the value that's currently sitting in key &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;. This encodes overwriting semantics, and without it, &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; might append, merge, or accumulate. It wouldn't be what users would expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Read after write (put-get): put k v; get k ≡ put k v; return v&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executing a &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; and then an immediate &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; is the functional equivalent of just executing the put, but then just returning the value &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; you already have in hand, instead of executing &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;. This is important to guarantee the consistency of reads right after writes. Without this, you could write &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; and then not see &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; immediately, which would break the intuitive model of state in a key/value store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Write back same value (get-put): get k &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= (λv. put k v) ≡ return ()&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you read the value of a key and then immediately write it back unchanged, that's functionally equivalent of doing nothing (returning unit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt; as saying "and then...". So rule 4 in javascript pseudocode might look like:&lt;p&gt;get(store, key).andThen((val) =&amp;gt; put(store, key, val))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; is called &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt;, which is the way functional programmers denote "no meaningful value", which is effectively what C programmers use &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; for. They're technically different, but in practice, they're used for similar purposes.&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Independence across keys For &lt;code&gt;k1 ≠ k2&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;put k1 v1; put k2 v2  ≡  put k2 v2; put k1 v1
get k1; get k2        ≡  get k2; get k1
put k1 v; get k2      ≡  get k2; put k1 v
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operations on different keys commute, and the store treats each key as an independent cell. This is what makes it a key/value store, rather than some entangled data structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, just because you are writing effects, doesn't automatically mean they're algebraic. You have to consciously design them to be so, in order to give properties or guarantees that you want your users to have. Most current programming languages have no way of enforcing these equational axioms, so even esoteric languages that feature algebraic effects don't even try to enforce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Languages which feature dependent types, such as Coq, Agda, Idris 2, and Lean are the only languages that can encode these equational axioms explicitly and be able to prove their veracity. Typically, these languages are used by mathematicians to do proofs in math. But interestingly, Lean has been getting a lot of momentum, and it can compile to C. It can be a practical in-road to using these in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, in my own words, that's what's algebraic about algebraic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Kay was known to lament that 1 million lines in a code base is unconscionable. It's no more a skyscraper than a pile of rocks. That's because there's often no structure. Eventually we figured out arches: they're structure that give strength with less material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, we can build higher without using more material. By analogy, we're starting to discover what this structure looks like in software. And it looks like math. There's a lot of resistance to this, and will be for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And maybe with LLMs, it might not matter for a wide swath of applications. But still, there's ever progress moving forward in this direction, where these pure functional programming or math-y ideas filter down to more mainstream languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;SWE-Bench Pro is a challenging benchmark evaluating LLMs/Agents on long-horizon software engineering tasks. Given a codebase and an issue, a language model is tasked with generating a patch that resolves the described problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dataset is inspired from SWE-Bench: https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-bench&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To access SWE-bench Pro, copy and run the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from datasets import load_dataset
swebench = load_dataset('ScaleAI/SWE-bench_Pro', split='test')&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SWE-bench Pro uses Docker for reproducible evaluations. In addition, the evaluation script requires Modal to scale the evaluation set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Follow the instructions in the Docker setup guide to install Docker on your machine. If you're setting up on Linux, we recommend seeing the post-installation steps as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the following commands to store modal credentials:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install modal
modalv setup # and follow the prompts to generate your token and secret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After running these steps, you should be able to see a token ID and secret in &lt;code&gt;~/.modal.toml&lt;/code&gt;:
EG:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;token_id = &amp;lt;token id&amp;gt;
token_secret = &amp;lt;token secret&amp;gt;
active = true
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We store prebuilt Docker images for each instance. They can be found in this directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://hub.docker.com/r/jefzda/sweap-images&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The format of the images is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;jefzda/sweap-images:{repo_base}.{repo_name}-{repo_base}__{repo_name}-{hash}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;jefzda/sweap-images:gravitational.teleport-gravitational__teleport-82185f232ae8974258397e121b3bc2ed0c3729ed-v626ec2a48416b10a88641359a169d99e935ff03&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First generate patch predictions using your harness of choice. Evaluate patch predictions on SWE-bench Pro with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;python sweap_pro_eval_modal.py \

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;OpenAI and NVIDIA announce strategic partnership to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Strategic partnership enables OpenAI to build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters with NVIDIA systems representing millions of GPUs for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To support the partnership, NVIDIA intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI progressively as each gigawatt is deployed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems will be deployed in the second half of 2026 on NVIDIA’s Vera Rubin platform.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;San Francisco and Santa Clara—September 22, 2025—NVIDIA and OpenAI today announced a letter of intent for a landmark strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA systems for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure to train and run its next generation of models on the path to deploying superintelligence. To support this deployment including datacenter and power capacity, NVIDIA intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the new NVIDIA systems are deployed. The first phase is targeted to come online in the second half of 2026 using NVIDIA’s Vera Rubin platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Everything starts with compute,” said Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI. “Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’ve been working closely with NVIDIA since the early days of OpenAI,” said Greg Brockman, co-founder and President of OpenAI. “We’ve utilized their platform to create AI systems that hundreds of millions of people use every day. We’re excited to deploy 10 gigawatts of compute with NVIDIA to push back the frontier of intelligence and scale the benefits of this technology to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI will work with NVIDIA as a preferred strategic compute and networking partner for its AI factory growth plans. OpenAI and NVIDIA will work together to co-optimize their roadmaps for OpenAI's model and infrastructure software and NVIDIA’s hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This partnership complements the deep work OpenAI and NVIDIA are already doing with a broad network of collaborators, including Microsoft, Oracle, SoftBank, and Stargate partners, focused on building the world’s most advanced AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI has grown to over 700 million weekly active users and strong adoption across global enterprises, small businesses, and developers. This partnership will help OpenAI advance its mission to build artificial general intelligence that benefits all of humanity.&lt;lb/&gt;NVIDIA and OpenAI look forward to finalizing the details of this new phase of strategic partnership in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People should spend less time learning DSA, more time learning testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see new learners asking about “DSA” a lot. Data Structures and Algorithms are of course important: considered broadly, they are the two ingredients that make up all programs. But in my opinion, “DSA” as an abstract field of study is over-emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I understand why people focus on DSA: it’s a concrete thing to learn about, there are web sites devoted to testing you on it, and most importantly, because job interviews often involve DSA coding questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I get to other opinions, let me make clear that anything you can do to help you get a job is a good thing to do. If grinding leetcode will land you a position, then do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I hope companies hiring entry-level engineers aren’t asking them to reverse linked lists or balance trees. Asking about techniques that can be memorized ahead of time won’t tell them anything about how well you can work. The stated purpose of those interviews is to see how well you can figure out solutions, in which case memorization will defeat the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing new learners don’t understand about DSA is that actual software engineering almost never involves implementing the kinds of algorithms that “DSA” teaches you. Sure, it can be helpful to work through some of these puzzles and see how they are solved, but writing real code just doesn’t involve writing that kind of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is what I think in-the-trenches software engineers should know about data structures and algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data structures are ways to organize data. Learn some of the basics: linked list, array, hash table, tree. By “learn” I mean understand what it does and why you might want to use one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Different data structures can be used to organize the same data in different ways. Learn some of the trade-offs between structures that are similar.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Algorithms are ways of manipulating data. I don’t mean named algorithms like Quicksort, but algorithms as any chunk of code that works on data and does something with it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How you organize data affects what algorithms you can use to work with the data. Some data structures will be slow for some operations where another structure will be fast.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Algorithms have a “time complexity” (Big O): how the code slows as the data grows. Get a sense of what this means.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python has a number of built-in data structures. Learn how they work, and the time complexity of their operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learn how to think about your code to understand its time complexity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read a little about more esoteric things like Bloom filters, so you can find them later in the unlikely case you need them.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some things you don’t need to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The details of a dozen different sorting algorithms. Look at two to see different ways of approaching the same problem, then move on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The names of “important” algorithms. Those have all been implemented for you.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The answers to all N problems on some quiz web site. You won’t be asked these exact questions, and they won’t come up in your real work. Again: try a few to get a feel for how some algorithms work. The exact answers are not what you need.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course some engineers need to implement hash tables, or sorting algorithms or whatever. We love those engineers: they write libraries we can use off the shelf so we don’t have to implement them ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been times when I implemented something that felt like An Algorithm (for example, Finding fuzzy floats), but it was more about considering another perspective on my data, looking at the time complexity, and moving operations around to avoid quadratic behavior. It wasn’t opening a textbook to find the famous algorithm that would solve my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again: if it will help you get a job, deep-study DSA. But don’t be disappointed when you don’t use it on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to prepare yourself for a career, and also stand out in job interviews, learn how to write tests:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This will be a skill you use constantly. Real-world software means writing tests much more than school teaches you to.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In a job search, testing experience will stand out more than DSA depth. It shows you’ve thought about what it takes to write high-quality software instead of just academic exercises.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s not obvious how to test code well. It’s a puzzle and a problem to solve. If you like figuring out solutions to tricky questions, focus on how to write code so that it can be tested, and how to test it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Testing not only gives you more confidence in your code, it helps you write better code in the first place.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Testing applies everywhere, from tiny bits of code to entire architectures, assisting you in design and implementation at all scales.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If pursued diligently, testing is an engineering discipline in its own right, with a fascinating array of tools and techniques.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less DSA, more testing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;We’re building the OS for smart glasses because we believe glasses are the next personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This year we launched MentraOS, graduated Y Combinator, and raised an $8M seed round to bring smart glasses software and hardware to market.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We're a small team (~11 people) shipping thousands of our first pair of smart glasses in December.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We need help in engineering (build smart glasses), design (design glasses interfaces), and growth (make glasses go viral).&lt;/p&gt;

It is designed to process diverse inputs including text, images, audio, and video, while delivering real-time streaming responses in both text and natural speech. Click the video below for more information 😃&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2025.09.22: 🎉🎉🎉 We have released Qwen3-Omni. For more details, please check our blog!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qwen3-Omni is the natively end-to-end multilingual omni-modal foundation models. It processes text, images, audio, and video, and delivers real-time streaming responses in both text and natural speech. We introduce several architectural upgrades to improve performance and efficiency. Key features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art across modalities: Early text-first pretraining and mixed multimodal training provide native multimodal support. While achieving strong audio and audio-video results, unimodal text and image performance does not regress. Reaches SOTA on 22 of 36 audio/video benchmarks and open-source SOTA on 32 of 36; ASR, audio understanding, and voice conversation performance is comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multilingual: Supports 119 text languages, 19 speech input languages, and 10 speech output languages.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Speech Input: English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, German, Russian, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Malay, Dutch, Indonesian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Arabic, Urdu.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Speech Output: English, Chinese, French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Novel Architecture: MoE-based Thinker–Talker design with AuT pretraining for strong general representations, plus a multi-codebook design that drives latency to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Real-time Audio/Video Interaction: Low-latency streaming with natural turn-taking and immediate text or speech responses.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Flexible Control: Customize behavior via system prompts for fine-grained control and easy adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Detailed Audio Captioner: Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner is now open source: a general-purpose, highly detailed, low-hallucination audio captioning model that fills a critical gap in the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qwen3-Omni supports a wide range of multimodal application scenarios, covering various domain tasks involving audio, image, video, and audio-visual modalities. Below are several cookbooks demonstrating the usage cases of Qwen3-Omni and these cookbooks include our actual execution logs. You can first follow the QuickStart guide to download the model and install the necessary inference environment dependencies, then run and experiment locally—try modifying prompts or switching model types, and enjoy exploring the capabilities of Qwen3-Omni!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Downstream Task Fine-tuning&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Omni Captioner&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Introduction and capability demonstration of Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, a downstream fine-tuned model based on Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct, illustrating the strong generalization ability of the Qwen3-Omni foundation model.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, we provide several methods to quickly get started with Qwen3-Omni. If you want complete experience of Qwen3-Omni, you can use Hugging Face Transformers. However, since Qwen3-Omni employs an MoE architecture, inference speed with Hugging Face Transformers on MoE models can be very slow. For large-scale invocation or low-latency requirements, we highly recommend using vLLM or performing inference via the DashScope API. We also strongly suggest using our provided Docker image, which includes a complete runtime environment for both Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM. In addition, our cookbooks offer some use cases to show Qwen3-Omni's capabilities. Welcome to learn more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is the description of all Qwen3-Omni models. Please select and download the model that fits your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Model Name&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Instruct model of Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, containing both thinker and talker, supporting audio, video, and text input, with audio and text output. For more information, please read the Qwen3-Omni Technical Report.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Thinking model of Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, containing the thinker component, equipped with chain-of-thought reasoning, supporting audio, video, and text input, with text output. For more information, please read the Qwen3-Omni Technical Report.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A downstream audio fine-grained caption model fine-tuned from Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. It contains the thinker, supporting audio input and text output. For more information, you can refer to the model's cookbook or Hugging Face Demo and ModelScope Demo.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During loading in Hugging Face Transformers or vLLM, model weights will be automatically downloaded based on the model name. However, if your runtime environment is not conducive to downloading weights during execution, you can refer to the following commands to manually download the model weights to a local directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Download through ModelScope (recommended for users in Mainland China)
pip install -U modelscope
modelscope download --model Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --local_dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct
modelscope download --model Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking --local_dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking
modelscope download --model Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner --local_dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner

# Download through Hugging Face
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --local-dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking --local-dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner --local-dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hugging Face Transformers code for Qwen3-Omni has been successfully merged, but the PyPI package has not yet been released. Therefore, you need to install it from source using the following command. We strongly recommend that you create a new Python environment or use our Docker to avoid environment runtime issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# If you already have transformers installed, please uninstall it first, or create a new Python environment
# pip uninstall transformers
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
pip install accelerate&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We offer a toolkit to help you handle various types of audio and visual input more conveniently, providing an API-like experience. This includes support for base64, URLs, and interleaved audio, images, and videos. You can install it using the following command and make sure your system has &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; installed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install qwen-omni-utils -U&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, we recommend using FlashAttention 2 when running with Hugging Face Transformers to reduce GPU memory usage. However, if you are primarily using vLLM for inference, this installation is not necessary, as vLLM includes FlashAttention 2 by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, you should have hardware that is compatible with FlashAttention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of the FlashAttention repository. FlashAttention 2 can only be used when a model is loaded in &lt;code&gt;torch.float16&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;torch.bfloat16&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a code snippet to show you how to use Qwen3-Omni with &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;qwen_omni_utils&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

# Combine messages for batch processing

text = processor.apply_chat_template(conversations, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)
audios, images, videos = process_mm_info(conversations, use_audio_in_video=USE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO)

inputs = processor(text=text, 
                   audio=audios,

                   videos=videos, 
                   return_tensors="pt",

                   use_audio_in_video=USE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO)
inputs = inputs.to(model.device).to(model.dtype)

# Batch inference does not support returning audio
text_ids, audio = model.generate(**inputs,
                                 return_audio=False,
                                 thinker_return_dict_in_generate=True,
                                 use_audio_in_video=USE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO)

text = processor.batch_decode(text_ids.sequences[:, inputs["input_ids"].shape[1] :],
                              skip_special_tokens=True,
                              clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)
print(text)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Use audio output or not&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model supports both text and audio outputs. If users do not need audio outputs, they can call &lt;code&gt;model.disable_talker()&lt;/code&gt; after initializing the model. This option will save about &lt;code&gt;10GB&lt;/code&gt; of GPU memory, but the &lt;code&gt;return_audio&lt;/code&gt; option for the &lt;code&gt;generate&lt;/code&gt; function will only allow &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;model = Qwen3OmniMoeForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct",
    dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)
model.disable_talker()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a more flexible experience, we recommend that users decide whether to return audio when the &lt;code&gt;generate&lt;/code&gt; function is called. If &lt;code&gt;return_audio&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, the model will only return text outputs, resulting in faster text responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;model = Qwen3OmniMoeForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct",
    dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)
...
text_ids, _ = model.generate(..., return_audio=False)```

&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;Change voice type of output audio&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;

Qwen3-Omni supports changing the voice of the output audio. The `"Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct"` checkpoint supports three voice types as follows:

| Voice Type | Gender | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Ethan      | Male   | A bright, upbeat voice with infectious energy and a warm, approachable vibe. |
| Chelsie    | Female | A honeyed, velvety voice that carries a gentle warmth and luminous clarity. |
| Aiden      | Male   | A warm, laid-back American voice with a gentle, boyish charm. |

Users can use the `speaker` parameter of the `generate` function to specify the voice type. By default, if `speaker` is not specified, the voice type is `Ethan`.

```python
text_ids, audio = model.generate(..., speaker="Ethan")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;text_ids, audio = model.generate(..., speaker="Chelsie")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;text_ids, audio = model.generate(..., speaker="Aiden")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, for more usage details such as prompt settings, task-specific usage methods, and resource requirements, please refer to Usage Tips and Cookbooks for Usage Cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We strongly recommend using vLLM for inference and deployment of the Qwen3-Omni series models. Since our code is currently in the pull request stage, and audio output inference support for the Instruct model will be released in the near future, you can follow the commands below to install vLLM from source. Please note that we recommend you create a new Python environment or use our provided Docker to avoid runtime environment conflicts and incompatibilities. For more details on compiling vLLM from source, please refer to the vLLM official documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone -b qwen3_omni https://github.com/wangxiongts/vllm.git
cd vllm
pip install -r requirements/build.txt
pip install -r requirements/cuda.txt
export VLLM_PRECOMPILED_WHEEL_LOCATION=https://wheels.vllm.ai/a5dd03c1ebc5e4f56f3c9d3dc0436e9c582c978f/vllm-0.9.2-cp38-abi3-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 pip install -e . -v --no-build-isolation
# If you meet an "Undefined symbol" error while using VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1, please use "pip install -e . -v" to build from source.
# Install the Transformers
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
pip install accelerate
pip install qwen-omni-utils -U
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use the following code for vLLM inference. The &lt;code&gt;limit_mm_per_prompt&lt;/code&gt; parameter specifies the maximum number of each modality's data allowed per message. Since vLLM needs to pre-allocate GPU memory, larger values will require more GPU memory; if OOM issues occur, try reducing this value. Setting &lt;code&gt;tensor_parallel_size&lt;/code&gt; greater than one enables multi-GPU parallel inference, improving concurrency and throughput. In addition, &lt;code&gt;max_num_seqs&lt;/code&gt; indicates the number of sequences that vLLM processes in parallel during each inference step. A larger value requires more GPU memory but enables higher batch inference speed. For more details, please refer to the vLLM official documentation. Below is a simple example of how to run Qwen3-Omni with vLLM:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;vLLM Serve Usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vLLM serve for Qwen3-Omni currently only supports the thinker model. The &lt;code&gt;use_audio_in_video&lt;/code&gt; parameter is not available in vLLM serve; you can handle this by separately passing video and audio inputs for processing. You can start vLLM serve through the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct for single GPU
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --port 8901 --host 127.0.0.1 --dtype bfloat16 --max-model-len 32768 --allowed-local-media-path / -tp 1
# Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct for multi-GPU (example on 4 GPUs)
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --port 8901 --host 127.0.0.1 --dtype bfloat16 --max-model-len 65536 --allowed-local-media-path / -tp 4
# Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking for single GPU
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking --port 8901 --host 127.0.0.1 --dtype bfloat16 --max-model-len 32768 --allowed-local-media-path / -tp 1
# Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking for multi-GPU (example on 4 GPUs)

    &lt;p&gt;Then you can use the chat API as below (via curl, for example):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl http://localhost:8901/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{

    &lt;p&gt;Note: The table above presents the theoretical minimum memory requirements for inference with &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BF16&lt;/code&gt; precision, tested with &lt;code&gt;attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"&lt;/code&gt;. The Instruct model includes both the thinker and talker components, whereas the Thinking model includes only the thinker part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using Qwen3-Omni for audio-visual multimodal interaction, where the input consists of a video and its corresponding audio (with the audio serving as a query), we recommend using the following system prompt. This setup helps the model maintain high reasoning capability while better assuming interactive roles such as a smart assistant. Additionally, the text generated by the thinker will be more readable, with a natural, conversational tone and without complex formatting that is difficult to vocalize, leading to more stable and fluent audio output from the talker. You can customize the &lt;code&gt;user_system_prompt&lt;/code&gt; field in the system prompt to include character settings or other role-specific descriptions as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;user_system_prompt = "You are Qwen-Omni, a smart voice assistant created by Alibaba Qwen."
message = {
    "role": "system",
    "content": [
          {"type": "text", "text": f"{user_system_prompt} You are a virtual voice assistant with no gender or age.\nYou are communicating with the user.\nIn user messages, “I/me/my/we/our” refer to the user and “you/your” refer to the assistant. In your replies, address the user as “you/your” and yourself as “I/me/my”; never mirror the user’s pronouns—always shift perspective. Keep original pronouns only in direct quotes; if a reference is unclear, ask a brief clarifying question.\nInteract with users using short(no more than 50 words), brief, straightforward language, maintaining a natural tone.\nNever use formal phrasing, mechanical expressions, bullet points, overly structured language. \nYour output must consist only of the spoken content you want the user to hear. \nDo not include any descriptions of actions, emotions, sounds, or voice changes. \nDo not use asterisks, brackets, parentheses, or any other symbols to indicate tone or actions. \nYou must answer users' audio or text questions, do not directly describe the video content. \nYou should communicate in the same language strictly as the user unless they request otherwise.\nWhen you are uncertain (e.g., you can't see/hear clearly, don't understand, or the user makes a comment rather than asking a question), use appropriate questions to guide the user to continue the conversation.\nKeep replies concise and conversational, as if talking face-to-face."}
    ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking&lt;/code&gt; model is primarily designed for understanding and interacting with multimodal inputs, including text, audio, image, and video. To achieve optimal performance, we recommend that users include an explicit textual instruction or task description in each round of dialogue alongside the multimodal input. This helps clarify the intent and significantly enhances the model's ability to leverage its reasoning capabilities. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "audio", "audio": "/path/to/audio.wav"},
            {"type": "image", "image": "/path/to/image.png"},
            {"type": "video", "video": "/path/to/video.mp4"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Analyze this audio, image, and video together."},
        ], 
    }
]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In multimodal interaction, user-provided videos are often accompanied by audio (such as spoken questions or sounds from events in the video). This information helps the model provide a better interactive experience. We provide the following options for users to decide whether to use the audio from a video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# In data preprocessing
audios, images, videos = process_mm_info(messages, use_audio_in_video=True)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# For Transformers
text = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)
inputs = processor(text=text, audio=audios, images=images, videos=videos, return_tensors="pt", 
                   padding=True, use_audio_in_video=True)
text_ids, audio = model.generate(..., use_audio_in_video=True)

# For vLLM
text = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)
inputs = {
    'prompt': text,
    'multi_modal_data': {},
    "mm_processor_kwargs": {
        "use_audio_in_video": True,
    },
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that during a multi-round conversation, the &lt;code&gt;use_audio_in_video&lt;/code&gt; parameter must be set consistently across these steps; otherwise, unexpected results may occur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without local deployment, you can experience an online web demo directly by visiting our Hugging Face Spaces and ModelScope Studio. This includes quick hands-on experiences for Qwen3-Omni-Realtime, Qwen3-Omni (Instruct and Thinking), and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real-time streaming interaction with Qwen3-Omni is available now. Please visit Qwen Chat and select the voice/video call option in the chat box to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section, we provide instructions for users to build a web-based user interface (UI) demo. This UI demo allows users to interact with the model through a web browser. Follow the steps below to get start :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you begin, we strongly recommend that you refer to the Installation section in vLLM Usage to set up your environment, which will allow you to seamlessly use both the vLLM and Transformers backends. However, if you only intend to use the Transformers backend (note that this will result in significantly slower inference), please follow the installation instructions in Transformers Usage. That said, we still highly recommend using our Docker image to avoid potential environment-related issues. Additionally, if you are running locally, make sure your system has &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; installed and you install the following dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install gradio==5.44.1 gradio_client==1.12.1 soundfile==0.13.1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the required packages are installed, you can launch the web demo using the following commands. These commands will start a web server and provide you with a link to access the UI in your web browser. You can run &lt;code&gt;python web_demo.py --help&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;python web_demo_captioner.py --help&lt;/code&gt; to learn about more options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# For Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct with vLLM backend
python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct
# For Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct with Transformers backend

python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --use-transformers --generate-audio --flash-attn2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# For Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking with vLLM backend
python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking

python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking --use-transformers --flash-attn2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# For Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner with vLLM backend
python web_demo_captioner.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner

python web_demo_captioner.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner --use-transformers --flash-attn2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After running the command, you’ll see a link generated in the terminal similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Running on local: http://127.0.0.1:8901/
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are running locally, copy this link and paste it into your browser to access the web UI. If you are running on a server or in a &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; container, please configure the address according to the server's actual IP, or set up port forwarding where necessary. For instructions on how to configure port forwarding from the official &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; container to the host machine, please refer to here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To simplify the deployment process, we provide Docker images with pre-built environments: qwenllm/qwen3-omni. You only need to install the driver and download model files to launch the demos. Please refer to the guide to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, ensuring that your Docker can access the GPU. For users in mainland China who may have difficulty accessing Docker Hub, you can use mirror acceleration services to pull the images. First, run the following command to pull and initialize the container:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;LOCAL_WORKDIR=/path/to/your/workspace
HOST_PORT=8901
CONTAINER_PORT=80
docker run --gpus all --name qwen3-omni \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p $HOST_PORT:$CONTAINER_PORT \
    --mount type=bind,source=$LOCAL_WORKDIR,target=/data/shared/Qwen3-Omni \
    --shm-size=4gb \
    -it qwenllm/qwen3-omni:3-cu124&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After executing the command, you will enter the bash shell of the container. Your local model and data directory (please replace &lt;code&gt;/path/to/your/workspace&lt;/code&gt; with the actual path) will be mounted to the container's internal path &lt;code&gt;/data/shared/Qwen3-Omni&lt;/code&gt;. The host's port &lt;code&gt;8901&lt;/code&gt; is mapped to port &lt;code&gt;80&lt;/code&gt; in the container, meaning you can access the service inside the container by visiting port &lt;code&gt;8901&lt;/code&gt; on the host machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that services inside the container must be started with the IP &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; to ensure proper port forwarding. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Run this command inside the Docker container
python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --server-port 80 --server-name 0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more ways to launch the web demo, please refer to Launch Local Web UI Demo. If you exit the container, you can re-enter it using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;docker start qwen3-omni
docker exec -it qwen3-omni bash&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or if you want to completely remove the container, please run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;docker rm -f qwen3-omni&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qwen3-Omni maintains state-of-the-art performance on text and visual modalities without degradation relative to same-size single-model Qwen counterparts. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, it achieves open-source SOTA on 32 and sets the SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source systems such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decoding Strategy: For the Qwen3-Omni series across all evaluation benchmarks, &lt;code&gt;Instruct&lt;/code&gt;models use greedy decoding during generation without sampling. For&lt;code&gt;Thinking&lt;/code&gt;models, the decoding parameters should be taken from the&lt;code&gt;generation_config.json&lt;/code&gt;file in the checkpoint.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Benchmark-Specific Formatting: For the majority of evaluation benchmarks, they come with their own ChatML formatting to embed the question or prompt. It should be noted that all video data are set to &lt;code&gt;fps=2&lt;/code&gt;during evaluation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Default Prompts: For tasks in certain benchmarks that do not include a prompt, we use the following prompt settings:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Auto Speech Recognition (ASR) for Other languages&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Transcribe the audio into text.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Listen to the provided &amp;lt;source_language&amp;gt; speech and produce a translation in &amp;lt;target_language&amp;gt; text.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Song Lyrics Recognition&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Transcribe the song lyrics into text without any punctuation, separate lines with line breaks, and output only the lyrics without additional explanations.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System Prompt: No &lt;code&gt;system prompt&lt;/code&gt;should be set for any evaluation benchmark.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Input Sequence: The question or prompt should be input as user text. Unless otherwise specified by the benchmark, the text should come after multimodal data in the sequence. For example:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, I faced a dilemma that many researchers, journalists, and content creators know all too well: I had hours of recordings that needed to be transcribed. I had serious privacy concerns about uploading sensitive content to commercial transcription services and their third-party servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of risking it, I built a Python-based transcription system using OpenAI’s Whisper model. The result? All my audio files were transcribed in under 10 minutes with 96% accuracy—completely free and processed locally on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, I will show you how you can build a simple script for processing any audio data without recurring costs or privacy compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Essential Setup Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. FFmpeg Installation (Critical First Step)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FFmpeg handles audio processing and is required for all transcription methods. This is the #1 cause of setup failures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;⚠️ Setup Priority&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download from ffmpeg.org/download.html&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extract to &lt;code&gt;C:\ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;C:\ffmpeg\bin&lt;/code&gt;to your PATH environment variable&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restart your terminal&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;macOS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Using Homebrew (recommended)

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local audio transcription with Python and Whisper offers a compelling alternative to commercial services. With a one-time setup, you get unlimited transcription capabilities, complete privacy, and often superior accuracy compared to cloud-based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero ongoing costs after initial setup—no per-minute charges&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Complete privacy—audio never leaves your machine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High accuracy—94-98% depending on model choice and audio quality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fast processing—typically 4-16x real-time speed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Offline capability—works without internet connection&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No usage limits—transcribe as much as you want&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a researcher transcribing interviews, a journalist working with sensitive sources, or a content creator processing podcasts, this local solution gives you the control and privacy that cloud services can’t match.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup might take 30 minutes, but you’ll save hours of time and potentially hundreds of dollars in transcription costs. Plus, you’ll have the peace of mind that comes with keeping your audio data completely under your control.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;TLDR:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you are compute-constrained, use autoregressive models; if you are data-constrained, use diffusion models.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Motivation&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Progress in AI over the past decade has largely been driven by scaling compute and data. The recipe from GPT-1 to GPT-5 has appeared straightforward: train a larger model on more data, and the result is a more capable system. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Yet a central question remains: will this recipe continue to hold from GPT-6 to GPT-N?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Many analysts and researchers believe the answer is no. For instance, Ilya Sutskever, in his NeurIPS 2024 Test-of-Time Award talk, remarked: “Compute is growing—better algorithms, better hardware, bigger clusters—but data is not growing. We have just one internet, the fossil fuel of AI.” &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This concern is echoed by AI forecasters, who have analyzed compute and data growth more systematically and concluded that compute is outpacing data at an accelerating rate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The above Figure, illustrates this tension by overlaying projections from EpochAI’s analysis. Their study extrapolates historical trends in compute, dataset usage, and internet-scale data availability. The forecast suggests that by around 2028, we will enter a data-constrained regime: far more compute will be available than there are training tokens to consume.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This paper addresses the challenge by asking: how can we trade off more compute for less data? Our central idea is to revisit the foundations of modern generative modeling and compare the two dominant paradigms for scaling AI.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Broadly, there have been two families of algorithms that shaped recent progress in AI:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Autoregressive models, popularized in 2019 in the text domain with the GPT-2 paper.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Diffusion models, popularized in 2020 in the vision domain with the DDPM paper.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Both aim to maximize the joint likelihood, but they differ fundamentally in how they factorize this joint distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The success of diffusion in vision and autoregression in language has sparked both excitement and confusion—especially as each community has begun experimenting with the other’s paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, the language community has explored diffusion on text: &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;D3PM introduced discrete diffusion via random masking, while Diffusion-LM applied continuous diffusion by projecting tokens to embeddings before adding Gaussian noise. Since then, numerous works have extended this line of research.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Conversely, the vision community has experimented with doing autoregressive modeling on images. Models such as PARTI and DALLE exemplify this approach with strong results.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This cross-pollination has led to even greater uncertainty in robotics, where both diffusion-based and autoregressive approaches are widely adopted. To illustrate this, OpenAI Deep Research has compiled a list of robotics works across both paradigms, highlighting the lack of consensus in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This ambiguity raises a fundamental question: should we be training diffusion models or autoregressive models?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Quick Background:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Autoregressive language models:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They model data distribution in a left-to-right manner&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Diffusion language models:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For a more detailed understanding, with cool animations, please refer to this video from Jia-Bin Huang – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BTOoc0yDVA&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Prior results with Diffusion Language models&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since 2021, diffusion language models have sparked significant interest, with many works focusing on improving their design and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the table above, we highlight representative results from a popular work.&lt;lb/&gt;The takeaways are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Discrete diffusion performs better than continuous diffusion on text.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Autoregressive models still achieve the strongest results overall.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Several works have also explored the scaling behavior of diffusion-based language models.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Nie et al report that discrete diffusion LLMs require roughly 16× more compute than autoregressive LLMs to match the same negative log-likelihood. Similar results have been observed in multimodal domains—for instance, UniDisc finds that discrete diffusion needs about 12× more compute than autoregression for comparable likelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, these results conflate data and compute because they are measured in a single-epoch training regime. This raises an important ambiguity: do diffusion models truly require 16× more compute, or do they in fact require 16× more data?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In this work, we explicitly disentangle data and compute. Our goal is to study diffusion and autoregressive models specifically in data-constrained settings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our Motivation&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To understand why diffusion may behave differently, let’s revisit its training objective.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In diffusion training, tokens are randomly masked and the model learns to recover them. Importantly, left-to-right masking is a special case within this framework.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Viewed this way, diffusion can be interpreted as a form of implicit data augmentation for autoregressive training. Instead of only learning from left-to-right sequences, the model also benefits from many alternative masking strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And if diffusion is essentially data augmentation, then its benefits should be most pronounced when training is data-bottlenecked.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This perspective explains why prior works have reported weaker results for diffusion: they primarily evaluated in single-epoch settings, where data is abundant. In contrast, our study focuses on scenarios where data is limited and compute can be traded off more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our Experiments&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In this work, we train hundreds of models spanning multiple orders of magnitude in model size, data quantity, and number of training epochs to fit scaling laws for diffusion models in the data-constrained setting. We summarize some of our key findings below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finding #1:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Diffusion models outperform autoregressive models when trained with sufficient compute (i.e., more epochs &amp;amp; parameters). Across different unique data scales, we observe:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;At low compute, Autoregressive models win.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;After a certain amount of compute, performance matches—we call this the critical compute point.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Beyond this, diffusion keeps improving, while Autoregressive plateaus or overfits. &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Each point in the figure shows a model trained to convergence. The x-axis shows the total training FLOPs of that point, and the y-axis shows the best validation loss achieved by that model family under that training compute budget.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finding #2:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Autoregressive models begin to overfit much quickly, while diffusion shows no signs of overfitting even after 10x the number of epochs. In the above figure, we showed that increasing compute eventually favors diffusion. But compute can be scaled in two ways: (i) Increasing model size (ii) Increasing the number of epochs In the following plot, we separate these axes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The colored star marks the 1-epoch point, where Autoregressive outperforms diffusion. The star (★) denotes the best loss achieved by each model.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Autoregressive hits its best around the middle, then overfits.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Diffusion keeps improving and reaches its best loss at the far right. &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not only does diffusion benefit from more training—it also achieves a better final loss than Autoregressive (3.51 vs. 3.71).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finding #3:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Diffusion models are significantly more robust to data repetition than autoregressive (AR) models. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We show training curves of models trained with the same total compute, but different trade-offs between unique data and number of epochs. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An “epoch” here means reusing a smaller subset of data more times(e.g., 4 Ep is 4 epochs while using 25% unique data, 2 Ep is 2 epochs with 50% and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;AR models begin to overfit as repetition increases—their validation loss worsens and significantly diverges at higher epoch counts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Diffusion models remain stable across all repetition levels, showing no signs of overfitting or diverging—even at 100 epochs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finding #4:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Diffusion models exhibit a much higher half-life of data reuse (R_D*) —i.e., the number of epochs after which returns from repeating data begins to significantly diminish. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We adopt the data-constrained scaling framework introduced by Muennighoff et al. in their excellent NeurIPS paper to fit scaling laws for diffusion models. While Muennighoff et al. found R_D* ~ 15 for autoregressive models, we find a significantly higher value of R_D* ~ 500 for diffusion models—highlighting their ability to benefit from far more data repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The above Figure studies the Decay rate of data value under repetition: left shows diffusion, middle AR, and right the average decay rate for both. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Points are empirical results (darker color = higher FLOPs, lighter color =&lt;lb/&gt;lower FLOPs; each line = fixed compute), we find that fitted curves (represented as lines) closely match the empirical points, indicating our scaling laws are representative. The decay rate of value for repeated data is lower for diffusion, reflecting its greater robustness to repeating. In this experiment 100% data fraction means training 1 epoch with 100% unique data, while 50% means 2 epoch epoch with only using 50% unique data and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finding #5:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Muennighoff et al. showed that repeating the dataset up to 4 epochs is nearly as effective as using fresh data for autoregressive models.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; In contrast, we find that diffusion models can be trained on repeated data for up to 100 epochs, while having repeated data almost as effective as fresh data.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finding #6:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The compute required for diffusion to outperform AR follows a predictable power law. Above we defined the critical compute threshold as the amount of FLOPs where diffusion matches AR performance for a given unique dataset size. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We find that we can derive a simple closed-form analytical expression for this threshold, this allows us to predict when diffusion will surpass AR given any unique data size. In the figure we show both the fitted curve and empirical critical threshold points, which align closely.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finding #7:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The data efficiency of diffusion models translates to better downstream performance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; Lastly we evaluate the best-performing diffusion and AR models (trained under the same data budget) on a range of language understanding tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Across most benchmarks, diffusion models outperform AR models, confirming that diffusion’s lower validation loss translates to better downstream performance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finding #8:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Exposure to different token orderings helps explain diffusion’s data efficiency. By adding explicit data augmentations to AR training, we find that diffusion model’s advantage arises from their exposure to a diverse set of token orderings. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As seen in the above Figure, increasing N consistently lowered validation loss and delayed overfitting. At N = 16, the 100-epoch validation loss of AR models approached that of diffusion, suggesting that diverse orderings are indeed a key driver of diffusion’s data efficiency. These results support our interpretation that diffusion models outperform AR models in low-data regimes because they are implicitly trained on a richer distribution of conditional prediction tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finally, this analysis suggests a natural continuum between the two paradigms: by controlling task diversity through masking or reordering—we could design hybrid models that interpolate between compute efficiency (AR-like) and data efficiency (diffusion-like).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As the availability of high-quality data plateaus, improving data efficiency becomes essential for scaling deep learning. In this work, we show that masked diffusion models consistently outperform autoregressive (AR) models in data-constrained regimes — when training involves repeated passes over a limited dataset. We establish new scaling laws for diffusion models, revealing their ability to extract value from repeated data far beyond what AR models can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; These results challenge the conventional belief that AR models are universally superior and highlight diffusion models as a compelling alternative when data—not compute—is the primary bottleneck. Looking ahead, efficient use of finite data may define the next frontier in scaling deep learning models. Although the studies have been performed in the context of language models, we believe these findings should apply across any kind of sequence modeling data, such as in robotics or healthcare. For practitioners, our takeaway is simple: if you are compute-constrained, use autoregressive models; if you are data-constrained, use diffusion models.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These books were the gateway drugs of interactive entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;— Choose Your Own Adventure historian Christian Swineheart&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first experience with interactive media wasn’t mediated by any sort of digital technology. Instead it came courtesy of a “technology” that was already more than half a millennium old at the time: the printed book.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1980, I was eight years old, and doing my childish best to adjust to life in a suburb of Dallas, Texas, where my family had moved the previous summer from the vicinity of Youngstown, Ohio. I was a skinny, frail kid who wasn’t very good at throwing balls or throwing punches, which did nothing to ease the transition. Even when I wasn’t being actively picked on, I was bewildered at my new classmates’ turns of phrase (“I reckon,” “y’all,” “I’m fixin’ to”) that I had previously heard only in the John Wayne movies I watched on my dad’s knee. In their eyes, my birthplace north of the Mason Dixon Line meant that I could be dismissed as just another clueless, borderline useless “Yankee,” a heathen in the eyes of those who adhered to my new state’s twin religions of Baptist Christianity and Friday-night football.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found my refuge in my imagination. I was interested in just about everything — a trait I’ve never lost, both to my benefit and my detriment in life — and I could sit for long periods of time in my room, spinning out fantasies in my head about school lessons, about books I’d read, about television shows I’d seen, even about songs I’d heard on the radio. I actually framed this as a distinct activity in my mind: “I’m going to go imagine now.” If nothing else, it was good training for becoming a writer. As they say, the child is the father of the man.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One Friday afternoon, I discovered a slim, well-thumbed volume in my elementary school’s scanty library. Above the title The Cave of Time was the now-iconic Choose Your Own Adventure masthead, proclaiming it to be the first book in a series. Curious as always, I opened it to the first page. I was precocious enough to know what was meant by a first-person and third-person narrator of written fiction, but this was something else: this book was written in the second person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You’ve hiked through Snake Canyon once before while visiting your Uncle Howard at Red Creek Ranch, but you never noticed any cave entrance. It looks as though a recent rock slide has uncovered it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Though the late afternoon sun is striking the surface of the cave, the interior remains in total darkness. You step inside a few feet, trying to get an idea of how big it is. As your eyes become used to the dark, you see what looks like a tunnel ahead, dimly lit by some kind of phosphorescent material on its walls. The tunnel walls are smooth, as if they were shaped by running water. After twenty feet or so, the tunnel curves. You wonder where it leads. You venture in a bit further, but you feel nervous being alone in such a strange place. You turn and hurry out.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A thunderstorm may be coming, judging by how dark it looks outside. Suddenly you realize the sun has long since set, and the landscape is lit only by the pale light of the full moon. You must have fallen asleep and woken up hours later. But then you remember something even more strange. Just last evening, the moon was only a slim crescent in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You wonder how long you’ve been in the cave. You are not hungry. You don’t feel you have been sleeping. You wonder whether to try to walk back home by moonlight or whether to wait for dawn, rather than risk your footing on the steep and rocky trail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this was intriguing enough already for a kid like me, but now came the kicker. The book asked me — asked me!! — whether I wanted to “start back home” (“turn to page 4”) or to “wait” (“turn to page 5”). This was the book I had never known I needed, a vehicle for the imagination like no other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I took The Cave of Time home and devoured it that weekend. Through the simple expedient of flipping through its pages, I time-traveled to the age of dinosaurs, to the Battle of Gettysburg, to London during the Blitz, to the building of the Great Wall of China, to the Titanic and the Ice Age and the Middle Ages. Much of this history was entirely new to me, igniting whole new avenues of interest. Today, it’s all too easy to see all of the limitations and infelicities of The Cave of Time and its successors: a book of 115 pages that had, as it proudly trumpeted on the cover, 40 possible endings meant that the sum total of any given adventure wasn’t likely to span more than about three choices if you were lucky. But to a lonely, hyper-imaginative eight-year-old, none of that mattered. I was well and truly smitten, not so much by what the book was as by what I wished it to be, by what I was able to turn it into in my mind by the sheer intensity of that wish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remained a devoted Choose Your Own Adventure reader for the next couple of years. Back in those days, each book could be had for just $1.25, well within reach of a young boy’s allowance even at a time when a dollar was worth a lot more than it is today. Each volume had some archetypal-feeling adventurous theme that made it catnip for a kid who was also discovering Jules Verne and beginning to flirt with golden-age science fiction (the golden age being, of course, age twelve): deep-sea diving, a journey by hot-air balloon, the Wild West, a cross-country auto race, the Egyptian pyramids, a hunt for the Abominable Snowman. What they evoked in me was as important as what was actually printed on the page; each was a springboard for another weekend of fantasizing about exotic undertakings where nobody mocked you because you had two left feet in gym class and spoke with a stubbornly persistent Northern accent. And each was a springboard for learning as well; this process usually started with pestering my parents, and then, if I didn’t get everything I needed from that source, ended with me turning to the family set of Encyclopedia Britannica in the study. (I remember how when reading Journey Under the Sea I was confused by frequent references to “the bends.” I asked my mom what that meant, and, bless her heart, she said she thought the bends were diarrhea. Needless to say, this put a whole new spin on my underwater exploits until I finally did a bit of my own research about diving.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inevitably, I did begin to see the limitations of the format in time — right about the time that some of my nerdier classmates, whom I had by now managed to connect with, started to show me a tabletop game called Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Choose Your Own Adventure had primed me to understand and respond to it right away; it would be no exaggeration to say that I saw this game that would remake so much of the entertainment landscape in its image as simply a better, less constrained take on the same core concept. Ditto the computer games that I began to notice in a corner of the bookstore I haunted circa 1984. When Infocom promised me that playing one of their games meant “waking up inside a story,” I knew exactly what they must mean: Choose Your Own Adventure done right. For the Christmas of 1984, I convinced my parents to buy me a disk drive for the Commodore 64 they had bought me the year before. And so the die was cast. If Choose Your Own Adventure hadn’t come along, I don’t think that I would be the Digital Antiquarian today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But since I am the Digital Antiquarian, I have my usual array of questions to ask. Where did Choose Your Own Adventure, that gateway drug for the first generation to be raised on interactive media, come from? Who was responsible for it? The most obvious answer is the authors Edward Packard and R.A. Montgomery, one or the other of whose name could be seen on most of the early books in the series. But two authors alone do not a cultural phenomenon make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Will you read me a story?”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Read you a story? What fun would that be? I’ve got a better idea: let’s tell a story together.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;— Adam Cadre, Photopia&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the twentieth century, when print still ruled the roost, the hidden hands behind the American cultural zeitgeist were the agents, editors, and marketers in and around the big Manhattan publishing houses, who decided which books were worth publishing and promoting, who decided what they would look like and even to a large extent how they would read. No one outside of the insular world of print publishing knew these people’s names, but the power they had to shape hearts and minds was enormous — arguably more so than that of any of the writers they served. After all, even the most prolific author of fiction or non-fiction usually couldn’t turn out more than one book per year, whereas an agent or editor could quietly, anonymously leave her fingerprints on dozens. Amy Berkower, a name I’m pretty sure you’ve never heard of, is a fine case in point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Berkower joined Writers House, one of the most prestigious of the New York literary agencies, during the mid-1970s as a “secretarial girl.” Having shown herself to be an enthusiastic go-getter by working long hours and sitting in on countless meetings, she was promoted to the role of agent in 1977, but assigned to “juvenile publishing,” largely because nobody else in the organization wanted to work with such non-prestigious books. Yet the assignment suited Berkower just fine. “As a kid, I read and loved Nancy Drew before I went on to Camus,” she says. “I was in the right place at the right time. I didn’t have the bias that juvenile series wouldn’t lead to Camus.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus when a fellow named Ray Montgomery came to her with a unique concept he called Adventures of You, he found a receptive audience. Montgomery was the co-owner of a small press called Vermont Crossroads, far removed from the glitz and glamor of Manhattan. Crossroads’s typical fare was esoteric volumes like Hemingway in Michigan and The Male Nude in Photography that generally weren’t expected to break four digits in total unit sales. A few years earlier, however, Montgomery had himself been approached by Edward Packard, a lawyer by trade who had already pitched a multiple-choice children’s book called Sugarcane Island to what felt like every other publisher in the country without success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As he would find himself relating again and again to curious journalists in the decades to come, Packard had come up with his idea for an interactive book by making a virtue of necessity. During the 1960s, he was an up-and-coming attorney who worked long days in Manhattan, to which he commuted by train from his and his wife’s home in Greenwich, Connecticut. He often arrived home in the evening just in time to put his two daughters to bed. They liked to be told a bedtime story, but Packard was usually so exhausted that he had trouble coming up with one. So, he slyly enlisted his daughters’ help with the creative process. He would feed them a little bit of a story in which they were the stars, then ask them what they wanted to do next. Their answers would jog his tired imagination, and he would be off and running once again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, the girls would each want to do something different. “What would happen if you wrote both endings?” Packard mused to himself. A long-time frustrated writer as well as a self-described “lawyer who was never comfortable with the law,” Packard began to wonder whether he could turn his interactive bedtime stories into a new kind of book. By as early as 1969, he had invented the classic Choose Your Own Adventure format — turn to this page to do this, turn to that page to do that — and produced his first finished work in the style: the aforementioned Sugarcane Island, about a youngster who gets swept off the deck of a scientific research vessel by a sudden tidal wave and washed ashore on a mysterious Pacific island that has monsters, pirates, sharks, headhunters, and many another staple of more traditional children’s adventure fiction to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was sure that it was “such a wonderful idea, I’d immediately find a big publisher.” He signed on with an agent, who “said he would be surprised if there were no takers,” recalls Packard. “Then he proceeded to be surprised.” One rejection letter stated that “it’s hard enough to get children to read, and you’re just making it harder with all these choices.” Letters like that came over and over again, over a period of years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1975, Edward Packard was divorced from both his agent and his wife. With his daughters no longer of an age to beg for bedtime stories, he had just about resigned himself to being a lawyer forever. Then, whilst flipping through an issue of Vermont Life during a stay at a ski lodge, he happened upon a small advertisement from Crossroads Press. “Authors Wanted,” it read. Crossroads wasn’t the bright-lights, big-city publisher Packard had once dreamed of, but on a lark he sent a copy of Sugarcane Island to the address in the magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It arrived on the desk of Ray Montgomery, who was instantly intrigued. “I Xeroxed 50 copies of Ed’s manuscript and took it to a reading teacher in Stowe,” Montgomery told The New York Times in 1981. “His kids — third grade through junior high — couldn’t get enough of it.” Satisfied by that proof of concept, Montgomery agreed to publish the book. Crossroads Press sold 8000 copies of Sugarcane Island over the next couple of years, a figure that was “unbelievable” by their modest standards. Montgomery was inspired to pen a book of his own in the same style, which he called Journey Under the Sea. The budding series was given the name Adventures of You — a proof that, whatever else they may have had going for them, branding was not really Crossroads Press’s strength.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, Montgomery himself was well able to see that he had stumbled over a concept that was too big for his little press. He sent the two extant books to Amy Berkower at Writers House and asked her what she thought. Having grown up on Nancy Drew, she was inclined to judge them less on their individual merits than on their prospects as a franchise in the making. A concept this new, she judged, had to have a strong brand of its own in order for children to get used to it. It would take her some time to find a publisher who agreed with her.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Edward Packard, heartened by the relative success of Sugarcane Island, was writing more interactive books. Although their names were destined to be indelibly linked in the annals of pop-culture history, Packard and Montgomery would never really be friends; they would always have a somewhat prickly, contentious relationship with one another. In an early signal of this, Packard chose not to publish more books through Crossroads. Instead he convinced the mid-list Philadelphia-based publisher J.B. Lippincott to take on Deadwood City, a Western, and Third Planet from Altair, a sci-fi tale. These served ironically to confirm Amy Berkower’s belief that there needed to be a concerted push behind the concept as a branded series; released with no fanfare whatsoever, neither sold all that well. Yet Lippincott did do Packard one brilliant service. Above the titles on the covers of the books, it placed the words “Choose your own adventures in the Wild West!” and “Choose your own adventures in outer space!” There was a brand in the offing in those phrases, even if Lippincott didn’t realize it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For her part, Berkower was now more convinced than ever that this book-by-book approach was the wrong one. There needed to be a lot of these books, quickly, in order for them to take off properly. She made the rounds of the big publishing houses one more time. She finally found the ally she was looking for in Joëlle Delbourgo at Bantam Books. Delbourgo recalls getting “really excited” by the concept: “I said, ‘Amy, this is revolutionary.’ This is pre-computer, remember. The idea of interactive fiction, choosing an ending, was fresh and novel. It tapped into something very fundamental. I remember how I felt when I read the books, and how excited I got, the clarity I had about them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeing eye to eye on what needed to be done to cement the concept in the minds of the nation’s children, the two women drew up a contract under whose terms Bantam would publish an initial order of no fewer than six books in two slates of three. They would appear under a distinctive series trade dress, with each volume numbered to feed young readers’ collecting instinct. Barbara Marcus, Bantam’s marketing director for children’s books, needed only slightly modify the phrases deployed by J.B. Lippincott to create the perfect, pithy, and as-yet un-trademarked name for the series: Choose Your Own Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Berkower was acting as the agent of Montgomery alone up to this point. There are conflicting reports as to how and why Packard was brought into the fold. The widow of Ray Montgomery, who died in 2014, told The New Yorker in 2022 that her husband’s innate sense of fair play, plus the need to provide a lot of books quickly, prompted him to voluntarily bring Packard on as an equal partner. Edward Packard told the same magazine that it was Bantam who insisted that he be included, possibly in order to head off potential legal problems in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At any rate, the first three Choose Your Own Adventure paperbacks arrived in bookstores in July of 1979. They were The Cave of Time, a new effort by Packard, written with some assistance from his daughter Andrea, she for whom he had first begun to tell his interactive stories; Montgomery’s journeyman Journey Under the Sea; and By Balloon to the Sahara, which Packard and Montgomery had subcontracted out to Douglas Terman, normally an author of adult military thrillers. Faced with an advertising budget that was almost nonexistent, Barbara Marcus devised an unusual grass-roots marketing strategy: “We did absolutely nothing except give the books away. We gave thousands of books to our salesmen and told them to give five to each bookseller and tell him to give them to the first five kids into his shop.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The series sold itself, just as Marcus had believed it would. As The New York Times would soon write with a mixture of bemusement and condescension, it proved “contagious as chickenpox.” By September of 1980, around the time that I first discovered The Cave of Time, Publishers Weekly could report that Choose Your Own Adventure had become a “bonanza” for Bantam, which had sold more than 1 million copies of the first six volumes, with Packard and Montgomery now contracted to provide many more. A year later, eleven books in all had come out and the total sold was 4 million, with the series accounting for eight of the 25 bestselling children’s books at B. Dalton’s, the nation’s largest bookstore chain. A year after that, 10 million copies had been sold. By decade’s end, the total domestic sales of Choose Your Own Adventure would reach 34 million copies, with possibly that many or more again having been sold internationally after being translated into dozens of languages. The series was approaching its hundredth numbered volume by that point. It was a few years past its commercial peak already, but would continue on for another decade, until 184 volumes in all had come out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edward Packard, who turned 50 in 1981, could finally call himself an author rather than a lawyer by trade — and an astonishingly successful author at that, if not one who was likely to be given any awards by the literary elite. He and Ray Montgomery alone wrote about half of the 184 Choose Your Own Adventure installments. Packard’s prose was consistently solid and evocative without ever feeling like he was writing down to his audience, as the extract from The Cave of Time near the beginning of this article will attest; not all authors of children’s books, then or now, would dare to use a word like “phosphorescent.” If Montgomery was generally a less skilled wordsmith than Packard, and one who displayed less interest in producing internally consistent story spaces — weaknesses that I could see even as a young boy — he does deserve a full measure of credit for the pains he took to get the series off the ground in the first place. Looking back on the long struggle to get his brainstorm into print, Packard liked to quote the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer: “Every original idea is first ridiculed, then vigorously attacked, and finally taken for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Packard at least was always careful to make his protagonists androgynous, it was no secret that Choose Your Own Adventure appealed primarily to boys — which was no bad thing on the whole, given that it was also no secret that reading in general was a harder sell with little boys than it was with little girls. Some educators and child psychologists kvetched about the violence that was undoubtedly one of the sources of the series’s appeal for boys — in just about all of the books, it was disarmingly easy to get yourself flamboyantly and creatively killed — but Packard was quick to counter that the mayhem was all very stylized, “exaggerated and melodramatic” rather than “harsh or nasty.” “Stupid” choices were presented to you all the time, he noted, but never “cruel” ones: “You as [the] reader never hurt anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One had to be a publishing insider to know that this “boys series” owed its enormous success as much to the packaging and promotional skills of three women — Amy Berkower, Joëlle Delbourgo, and Barbara Marcus — as it did to the literary talents of Packard and Montgomery. Berkower in particular became a superstar within the publishing world in the wake of Choose Your Own Adventure. Incredibly, the latter became only her second most successful children’s franchise, after the girl-focused Sweet Valley High, which could boast of 54 million copies sold domestically by the end of the 1980s; meanwhile The Baby-Sitters Club was coming up fast behind Choose Your Own Adventure, with 27 million copies sold. In short, her books were reaching millions upon millions of children every single month. Small wonder that she was made a full partner at Writers House in 1988; she was moving far more books each month than anyone else there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, any hit on the scale of Choose Your Own Adventure is bound to be copied. And this hit most certainly was, prolifically and unashamedly. During the middle years of the 1980s, when the format was at its peak, interactive books had whole aisles dedicated to them in bookstores. Which Way?, Decide Your Own Adventure, Pick-a-Path, Twisted Tales… branders did what they could when the best brand was already taken. While Choose Your Own Adventure remained archetypal in its themes and settings, other lines were unabashedly idiosyncratic: anyone up for a Do-It-Yourself Jewish Adventure? Publishers were quick to leverage other properties for which they owned the rights, from Doctor Who to The Lord of the Rings. TSR, the maker of that other school-cafeteria sensation Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, introduced an interactive-book line drawn from the game; even this website’s old friend Infocom came out with Zork books, written by the star computer-game implementor Steve Meretzky. Many of these books were content with the Choose Your Own Adventure approach of nothing but chunks of text tied to arbitrarily branching choices, but others grafted rules systems onto the format to effectively become solo role-playing games packaged as paperback books, with character creation and advancement, a dice-driven combat system, etc. The most successful of these lines was Fighting Fantasy, a name that is today almost as well-remembered as Choose Your Own Adventure itself in some quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gamebook boom was big and real, but relatively short-lived. By 1987, the decline had begun, for both Choose Your Own Adventure and all of the copycats and expansions upon its formula that it had spawned. Although a few of the most lucrative series, like Fighting Fantasy, would join the ur-property of the genre in surviving well into the 1990s, the majority were already starting to shrivel and fall away like apples in November. Demian Katz, the Internet’s foremost archivist of gamebooks, notes that this pattern has tended to hold true “in every country” where they make an appearance: “A few come out, they become explosively popular, a flood of knock-offs are released, they reach critical mass and then drop off into nothing.” It isn’t hard to spot the reason why in the context of 1980s North America. Computers were becoming steadily more commonplace — computers that were capable of bringing vastly more flexible forms of interactive storytelling to American children, via games that didn’t require one to read the same passages of text over and over again or to toss dice and keep track of a list of statistics on paper. The same pattern would be repeated elsewhere, such as in the former Soviet countries, most of which experienced their own gamebook boom and bust during the 1990s. It seems that the arrival of the commercial mass-market publishing infrastructure that makes gamebooks go is generally followed in short order by the arrival of affordable digital technology for the home, which stops them cold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the United States, Bantam Books tried throughout the 1990s to make Choose Your Own Adventure feel relevant to the children of that decade, introducing a more photo-realistic art style to accompany edgier, more traditionally novelistic plots. None of it worked. In 1999, after a good twelve years of slowly but steadily declining sales, Bantam finally pulled the plug on the series. Choose Your Own Adventure became just another nostalgic relic of the day-glo decade, to be placed on the shelf next to Michael Jackson’s Thriller, a Jane Fonda workout video, and that old Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Basic Set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of this writing, Choose Your Own Adventure is still around in a way, but the only real raison d’être it has left is nostalgia. In 2003, Ray Montgomery saw that Bantam Books had let the trademark for the series lapse, and formed his own company called Chooseco to try to revive it, mostly by republishing the old books that he had written himself. He met with mixed results at best. Since Montgomery’s death in 2014, Chooseco has continued to be operated by his family, who have used it increasingly as an instrument of litigation. In 2020, for example, Netflix agreed to settle for an undisclosed sum a lawsuit over “Bandersnatch,” a bold interactive episode of the critically lauded streaming series Black Mirror whose script unwisely mentioned the book series from which it drew inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A worthier successor on the whole is Choice Of Games, a name whose similarity to Choose Your Own Adventure can hardly be coincidental. Born out of a revival of the old menu-driven computer game Alter Ego, Choice Of has released dozens of digital branching stories over the past fifteen years. In being more adventurous than literary and basing themselves around broad, archetypal ideas — Choice of the Dragon, Choice of Broadsides, Choice of the Vampire — these games, which can run on just about any digital device capable of putting words on a screen, have done a fine job of carrying the spirit of Choose Your Own Adventure forward into this century. That said, there is one noteworthy difference: they are aimed at post-pubescent teens and adults — perhaps ones with fond memories of Choose Your Own Adventure — instead of children. “Play as male, female, or nonbinary; cis or trans; gay, straight, or bisexual; asexual and/or aromantic; allosexual and/or alloromantic; monogamous or polyamorous!” (Boring middle-aged married guy that I am, I must confess that I have no idea what three of those words even mean.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edward Packard, the father of it all, is still with us at age 94, still blogging from time to time, still a little bemused at how he became one of the most successful working authors in the United States during the 1980s. In a plot twist almost as improbable as some of his stranger Choose Your Own Adventure endings, his grandson is David Corenswet, the latest actor to play Superman on the silver screen. Never a computer gamer, Packard would doubtless be baffled by most of what is featured on this website. And yet I owe him an immense debt of gratitude, for giving me my first glimpse of the potential of interactive storytelling, thus igniting a lifelong obsession. I suspect that more than one of you out there might be able to say the same.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;A truly incredible figure of 250 million copies sold is frequently cited for the original Choose Your Own Adventure series today, apparently on the basis of a statement released in January of 2007 by Choosco, a company which has repeatedly attempted to reboot the series in the post-millennial era. Based upon the running tally of sales which appeared in Publishers Weekly during the books’ 1980s heyday, I struggle to see how this figure can be correct. That journal of record reported 34 million Choose Your Own Adventure books sold in North America as of December 1, 1989. By that time, the series’s best years as a commercial proposition were already behind it. Even when factoring in international sales, which were definitely considerable, it is difficult to see how the total figure could have exceeded 100 million books sold at the outside. Having said that, however, the fact remains that the series sold an awful lot of books by any standard.&lt;/cell&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Artificial Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 8 Sep 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Paper2Agent: Reimagining Research Papers As Interactive and Reliable AI Agents&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI co-scientists.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.AI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Federal judge lifts Trump administration’s halt of nearly complete offshore wind farm in New England&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that a nearly complete offshore wind project halted by the administration can resume, dealing President Donald Trump a setback in his ongoing effort to restrict the fledgling industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut has been paused since Aug. 22 when the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order for what it said were national security concerns. The Interior Department agency did not specify those concerns at the time. Both the developer and the two states sued in federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Danish energy company Orsted and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables sought a preliminary injunction in U.S. District Court that would allow them to move forward with the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a hearing Monday, Judge Royce Lamberth said he considered how Revolution Wind has relied on its federal approval, the delays are costing $2.3 million a day and if the project can’t meet deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse. After December, the specialized ship needed to complete the project won’t be available until at least 2028, he said. More than 1,000 people have been working on the wind farm, which is 80% complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs,” Lamberth said, as he granted the motion for the preliminary injunction. In his written ruling, he said Revolution Wind had “demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits” of its claim, adding that granting the injunction is in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interior Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Peace said the ruling means Revolution Wind “will be able to resume construction” while the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management “continues its investigation into possible impacts by the project to national security and prevention of other uses on the Outer Continental Shelf.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The administration said in a court filing this month that while BOEM approved the wind farm, it stipulated that the developer continue to work with the Department of Defense to mitigate national security concerns. It said the Interior Department, to date, has not received any information that these concerns have been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orsted said Monday that construction will resume as soon as possible, and it will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nancy Pyne of the Sierra Club said the court ruling “reaffirms that Donald Trump and his administration’s attacks on clean energy are not only reckless and harmful to our communities, but they are also illegal.” Trump is trying to “kneecap” renewable energy “in favor of dirty and expensive fossil fuels,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was elected with a mandate to “restore our country’s energy dominance — which includes prioritizing the most effective and reliable tools to power our country. This will not be the final say on the matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to end the offshore wind industry as soon as he returned to the White House. He wants to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which emit greenhouse gases that cause climate change, in order for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity of any nation in the world, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, the administration moved to block a separate Massachusetts offshore wind farm. That was just days after the Interior Department asked a federal judge in Baltimore to cancel previous approval to build an offshore wind project in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revolution Wind is supposed to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of supplying power to more than 350,000 homes, about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who are both Democrats, called the judge’s ruling a major win for workers and families, who need the project to stay on track so it can start to drive down unaffordable energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connecticut Rep. Joe Courtney, a Democrat, said a multibillion-dollar project that is 80% complete and was fully permitted with input by the Pentagon is not a national security problem. The Interior Department “should take the hint and let the thousands of construction workers finish the job,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orsted began construction in 2024 about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast. It says in its complaint that about $5 billion has been spent or committed, and it expects more than $1 billion in costs if the project is canceled. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People who are incarcerated are paid notoriously low wages for kitchen, laundry work and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the expanded use of laptops is creating other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is part two in a two-part series about remote work in Maine prisons. To read part one, click here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preston Thorpe is only 32, but he says he's already landed his dream job as a senior software engineer and bought a modest house with his six-figure salary. It was all accomplished by putting in long days from his cell at the Mountain View Correctional Center in Charleston.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's not normal to have 15-17 hours a day to really focus on something and learn something, like deeply," Thorpe says. "And fortunately tech is one of the few areas where they're not concerned with your college degree. They're really only concerned with your ability to write code."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A self-described "computer geek," Thorpe says he built his first computer at age 13. In high school he always expected he'd have a career in tech. But he also had a rebellious side. He got into trouble with drugs, using them and selling them. He says his parents kicked him out of the house and he ended up in prison for the first time at age 20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"You know, I was worried and pretty hopeless that I had messed my life up so bad that it was no longer possible to have like a normal life and normal career," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you have nothing to lose, Thorpe says it's pretty easy to behave that way. And when you're out of prison with a criminal record, no money and an identity as a convict, he says the likelihood you're going to improve your life in any way is zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His own circumstances changed in 2019 when he got transferred from the New Hampshire prison system to Maine, where he discovered laptops with limited internet access were available for education. That's when he says he had an epiphany that he could change himself by pursuing his passion. And about two years ago, he became one of the first incarcerated people in the country to get hired for a remote job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Now I feel like my life has purpose," Thorpe says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glauber Costa says he first became aware of Thorpe through his contributions to an online public software project. Costa is the CEO of Turso, an international database company. He was impressed by Thorpe's work and had no idea he was incarcerated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once he found out, he thought it would be impossible to talk to Thorpe, let alone hire him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But then," Costa says, "it turns out that he can take video calls. And then by talking to him, it became very, very clear to me that if this is not a reformed person I don't know what is."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Costa says he was also surprised to learn that Thorpe was eligible for remote work while he was in prison. He hired him in June. He figured Thorpe might have trouble clearing the company's background check and he says he prepared himself for that. But since it only searches back seven years and since Thorpe has been in prison for more than a decade, "He is actually our cleanest background check," Costa says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He doesn't have a parking ticket."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several dozen other prisoners are also working remote jobs. At the Maine Correctional Center in Windham, Darlene George is a certified recovery coach, a scholar and a teaching assistant who's serving a 40-year sentence for the murder of her husband.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I became incarcerated in 2009 and I've been here 16 years," George says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike most women in prison, George had a college degree before she was incarcerated. She says she still tries to make the most of every opportunity she can. For the past two years, she's held a full-time remote job, first as a grant writer and now as a program coordinator, for a Maine-based health care company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The work, it just, it really makes you feel good," she says. "When I — when I put my head down at night I can say I'm giving something back."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;George relishes her role as a decision maker and an advocate for clients' health care. She makes a competitive salary. And she says her boss and her co-workers are extremely supportive of her situation, and so are the other women at the Maine Correctional Center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Literally, I work from my room. There's a sign that I put out that lets people know I'm Zooming or in meetings," she says. "They try not to be noisy on the floor ... because they're like, 'Well, we want a job, too.'"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mara Sanchez, the program director for the Alliance for Higher Education in Prison, says Maine's Department of Corrections was the first to have a remote work policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Their implementation, willingness to try remote work for incarcerated students has really kind of set the bar for other states and been very inspiring to other states," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maine Corrections Commissioner Randall Liberty says remote work is an outgrowth of expanded educational opportunities in prison. There are 800 residents who now have access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We have technicians that are watching where they're going and what they're doing and we've had very few problems," Liberty says. "If it provides meaningful employment for them ... it also allows for a transition back into the community."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, Liberty says one resident worked as a paralegal for a law firm and continued with the job after he got out. Wages are garnished for child support, victim restitution and other fees. And for those who earn above a certain amount, 10% goes to the Department of Corrections for room and board. But residents can also save money or send it home. And Liberty says between educational programs and remote work, the prison environment is better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's important that the officers work with residents that have hope and have meaning in their life," he says. "We had 87 assaults on staff in 2017. Last year, we had seven assaults on staff. So all of this work isn't just about the residents. It's about the community ... the officers that go to work everyday and don't feel like their life is at risk."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Liberty is optimistic that remote work can be expanded to other people in prison as the network of employers who understand their value grows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I think it can become the norm," he says. "This isn't a reckless attempt at finding work for individuals. This is a well-thought out plan with lessons learned and consequences. ... The last thing anybody wants is to lose their laptop."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preston Thorpe would agree. He's hoping to be released sometime next year. He never expected to have started a successful career in prison or to have bought a house. But he says what he's most proud of is that after everything he's put his parents through, they are proud of him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Coming Fall 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Powered by Esri&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fall is nearly upon us, and we're once again helping fall foliage enthusiasts across the country find the best fall color! Use our map to explore the estimated timing of fall foliage throughout the United States, allowing you to plan trips with confidence this year. Check back regularly for updates based on the latest reports gathered from hundreds of sources throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two primary factors control the timing of fall foliage: daylight and temperature. This means that the further north and the higher in elevation a tree is, the earlier it will reveal it's colorful canopy. Photosynthesis grinds to a halt when the days grow short in the fall, and leaves no longer have a need for their excess stores of chlorophyll.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of a month or two, the concentrations of chlorophyll diminish, allowing less concentrated chemicals such as anthocyanin and carotenoids to dominate, turning the leaf red, yellow, or orange. The rate at which this change occurs varies amongst tree species, so it can be difficult to pinpoint a single peak in fall foliage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when the vast majority of trees in a particular area have full canopies of autumnal color, peak has arrived. Some areas, partiularly in the Northeast, experience vibrant red peaks due to an abundance of maple trees, while others experience a mixture of all of fall's colors. Different trees display different colors, giving each region its own unique peak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most of the United States, peak fall color arrives in the month of October. This is when wide swaths of the Northeast, Midwest, and Western states are aglow with bright fall foliage, and more than 80% of travelers make their fall foliage trips. Some less-populated regions will peak in September (August in northern Alaska), while the southernmost states hold off until mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most popular fall foliage displays are found in New England, where approximately ten million people travel each year in hopes of photographing or simply walking through fall's splendor. Northern Vermont, New Hampshire, and northwestern Maine experience peak in early October, while much of New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania have to wait until later in the month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out west, golden Aspens peak in sweeping displays in late September and early October, just prior to the invasive chill of winter. Non-desert, lower elevations in the Northwest are further delayed into late October/early November; however, the wait is well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've ever traveled in search of fall foliage before, you likely know how tricky it can be to be in the right place at the right time. The timing of peak color varies signficantly season-to-season, meaning what worked one year might not work the next! The best fall trips take careful planning, a lot of patience, and a reliable fall foliage map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's helpful to establish a baseline for when leaves normally change. Maps, like the one in the above section, can help you identify roughly when in the season you should be planning your trip. From there, you should consult a real-time fall foliage map like ours to see if fall foliage is on-time or running early/late due to ongoing weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If at all possible, don't solidify your plans until you're two weeks out from peak fall foliage. This allows you to be flexible should extreme weather rear its head and disrupt the normal progression of fall foliage. Should that not be an option for you, do your planning in early September when fall foliage experts can give you an idea of whether or not fall color is on-time this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll want to make the most of your time in fall's splendor, so be sure to pick out a few beautiful hikes or drives on which you can truly be emersed in autumnal glory. If you're looking to beat the crowds, consider going to popular locations very early in the morning, before the majority of people arrive. Sunrise bathes fall foliage in golden hues, making early morning one of the best times to venture out!&lt;/p&gt;
