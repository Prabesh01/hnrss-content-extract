    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Humans can accurately sense the position, speed, and torque of their limbs, even with their eyes shut. This sense, known as proprioception, allows humans to precisely control their body movements.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s conventional prosthetic limbs do not provide feedback to the nervous system. Because of this, people with amputated limbs cannot feel the position, speed, and torque of their prosthetic joints without looking at them, making it difficult to control their movement. In order to create a more complete prosthetic control experience, researchers at the MIT Media Lab invented the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI). The AMI is a method to restore proprioception to persons with amputation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past several months, I’ve been receiving and then ignoring a steady stream of concerning emails from Sendgrid, the popular email delivery service owned by Twilio that I use for sending emails from Breadwinner. I’d see some weird API error notification, login to my SendGrid account, check everything is working properly, and then delete the email. I didn’t pay too close attention to them until I saw a couple very strange ones. &lt;lb/&gt;Today, I received this one implying SendGrid was going to be adding a “Support ICE” button to all emails sent through their platform:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;If you’ve been paying any attention at all to US politics, you’ll know how insidiuously provocative this would be if it were a real email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it isn’t. It’s a phishing email. If you use SendGrid, or have ever used it, you might be getting these too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This phishing campaign is a fascinating example of how sophisticated social engineering has become. Instead of Nigerian 419 scams, hackers have evolved to carefully craft messages sent to professionals that are designed to exploit the American political consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opt-out buttons are the trap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Attack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works: hackers compromise SendGrid customer accounts (through credential stuffing, password reuse, the usual methods). Once they have access, they can send emails through SendGrid’s infrastructure, which means the emails pass all the standard authentication checks (SPF, DKIM) that your spam filter uses to determine legitimacy. The emails look real because, technically, they are real SendGrid emails sent via SendGrid’s platform and via a customer’s reputation – they’re just sent by the wrong people and wrong domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re likely using a list of SendGrid customers so they can target this to only people who have used the service before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security researchers at Netcraft dubbed this “Phishception” back in 2024: attackers using SendGrid to phish SendGrid users, creating a self-perpetuating cycle where each compromised account can be used to compromise more accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been going on for years. Brian Krebs wrote about it in 2020. And yet here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Lures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s changed, or at least what I’ve noticed recently, is the political sophistication of the bait. The attackers aren’t just sending “your account is suspended” emails (though they do that too). They’re sending messages designed to provoke a strong emotional reaction that compels you to click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some I’ve received:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The LGBT Pride Footer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one claims SendGrid’s CEO “James Mitchell” (not a real person) came out as gay, and to show support, SendGrid is adding a pride-themed footer to all emails. “We understand this may not be right for everyone,” it helpfully notes, offering a “Manage Preferences” button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the opt-out. If you support LGBTQ+ rights, you might ignore this. But if you don’t? You’re clicking that button immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Black Lives Matter Theme&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For “one week,” all emails will feature a commemorative theme honoring George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. This change applies “platform-wide to all users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again: “If you prefer not to participate, you can opt out below.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the sender domain: nellions.co.ke, a Kenyan domain. This is a compromised SendGrid customer account being used to send phishing emails to American targets about American political issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The ICE Support Initiative&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one arrived just this morning. SendGrid is supposedly adding a “Support ICE” donation button to the footer of every email sent through their platform, “in response to recent events” and “as part of our commitment to supporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The timing here is notable: these hackers are reading the news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Spanish Language Switch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then there’s this one, which is just absurd: “Your language preference has been successfully changed to Spanish. All emails sent via the API will now be formatted in Spanish.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is less politically charged and more “wait, what? I didn’t do that” – just enough anxiety to get you to click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Classic Account Termination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course, they still do the classics: “Your account has been terminated for misusing sending guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Pattern&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look closely at those sender addresses again at the top of the Gmail message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;drummond.com&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;nellions.co.ke&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;theraoffice.com&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;nutritionsociety.org&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;myplace.co&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these are sendgrid.com. They’re all legitimate businesses whose SendGrid accounts have been compromised. When these emails hit your inbox, they pass authentication because they really were sent through SendGrid, just not by SendGrid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who’s Behind This?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The political sophistication on display here (BLM, LGBTQ+ rights, ICE, even the Spanish language switch playing on immigration anxieties) suggests someone with a deep understanding of American cultural fault lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that state actors have invested heavily in understanding and exploiting these divisions. Russian active measures campaigns have been documented doing exactly this kind of work: identifying wedge issues and creating content designed to inflame both sides. North Korea has demonstrated similar sophistication in their social engineering operations by targeting academics and foreign policy experts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying this is a state actor necessarily – the economic value of exploiting SendGrid’s formidable email infrastructure is most likely the appeal here. Similarly, this could just as easily be a domestic operation run by someone who’s extremely online and knows which culture war buttons to push. But I think the skill set required (technical ability to compromise accounts at scale plus cultural fluency in American politics) is notable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Can This Be Fixed?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SendGrid has known about this problem for years. Twilio (SendGrid’s parent company) has talked about requiring two-factor authentication for all customers, but implementation has been slow. The fundamental issue is that SendGrid’s business model depends on making it easy for legitimate businesses to send email at scale. Anything that adds friction for good actors also adds friction for bad actors, but the bad actors are more motivated to work around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the attackers only need one thing: access to SendGrid customer accounts. As long as people reuse passwords and don’t enable 2FA, there will be a steady supply of compromised accounts. It’s a bit of a hydra problem: cut off one head, another grows behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Protecting Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a SendGrid customer: enable two-factor authentication immediately. Use a unique password. Check your account for unauthorized API keys or sender identities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re just receiving these emails: don’t click anything. The links go to fake SendGrid login pages that will steal your credentials in real-time as they actually validate your password against SendGrid’s API and even capture your 2FA codes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Filter Hack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Gmail users, you can create a filter to automatically delete SendGrid impersonation emails that don’t come from legitimate SendGrid domains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go to Settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses → Create new filter&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the “From” field, enter: &lt;code&gt;-from:sendgrid.com -from:twilio.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the “Has the words” field, enter: &lt;code&gt;sendgrid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Click “Create filter” and select “Delete it”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will catch emails that mention SendGrid but aren’t actually from SendGrid. It’s not perfect, but it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Have You Gotten These?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m curious what other variations are out there. If you’ve received SendGrid phishing emails (especially weird or politically-charged ones) leave a comment or reach out. The more examples we document, the easier it is for people to recognize these when they land in their inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you work at Twilio/SendGrid and want to explain what’s being done about this: I’m all ears.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Data at Risk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~5,000 police departments, ~6,000 community deployments, and ~1,000 private businesses&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Status&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Remediated following responsible disclosure&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I discovered a Default ArcGIS API key embedded in Flock Safety's public-facing JavaScript bundles. This single credential granted access to the company's ArcGIS mapping environment, and 50 private layers, the same infrastructure that consolidates license plate detections, patrol car locations, drone telemetry, body camera locations, 911 call data, and surveillance camera locations from approximately 12,000 law enforcement, community, and private sector deployments nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key was not restricted by referrer, IP, or origin allowing it to be used by anyone, anywhere. It was exposed publicly across 53 separate Flock Safety front-end bundles and environments, each instance independently granting access to their ArcGIS mapping platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background: What is Flock Safety?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across the United States, license plate readers, drones, and audio sensors quietly record the movements of millions of people every day. Flock Safety operates one of the largest and most rapidly expanding of these networks, with hundreds of thousands of cameras generating over 30 billion vehicle detections each month, and an undisclosed amount of people detections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the center of this infrastructure is FlockOS, which Flock markets under the headline "One map. Smarter Response." According to their own documentation, the ArcGIS-powered interface "consolidates all data streams and the locations of each connected asset, enabling greater situational awareness and a common operating procedure." (Source: ClearGov Resource Document)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That "one map" is not a metaphor. It is the ArcGIS stack itself and the exposed API key unlocked it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Vulnerability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exposed credential was an organization-wide ArcGIS API key tied directly to Flock Safety's ArcGIS mapping environment. It appeared in client-side JavaScript bundles served from development subdomains that were publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Querying the ArcGIS API with this key returned metadata confirming its scope and the extent of Flock's misconfiguration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The credential was tagged appTitle: "Default API Key", the auto-generated key Esri creates at account signup. According to Esri's ArcGIS documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"An API key is a permanent access token that defines the scope and permission for granting your public-facing application access to specific, ready-to-use services and private content... An API key is created for you when you sign up for an ArcGIS Developer account."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key's metadata listed 50 "portal:app:access:item: privileges each granting access to a private ArcGIS item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given Flock's centralized "one map" architecture where participating agencies contribute data to shared, Flock-owned layers rather than maintaining separate instances each of those 50 private items likely aggregates data from hundreds or thousands of agencies. A single Detections layer would contain hotlist hits from all ~5,000 participating police departments. A single Mobile Units layer would show patrol car positions across every integrated agency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Esri's documentation warns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"For the highest level of security, always set the API key scopes and referrers before deploying an application."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock applied no referrer restrictions, no IP allowlist, and no scope limitations. They took the default key, granted it access to 50 private items, and embedded it in client-side JavaScript bundles across 53 publicly accessible endpoints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;53 Exposed Endpoints (hostnames redacted):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Each endpoint independently served the same unrestricted credential 53 times, and any one of them could have been used to access Flock's ArcGIS environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FlockOS: The Unified Attack Surface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FlockOS map component signature reveals the unified layer architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ru=({
  esriMapsApiKey: t,
  baseLayers: n,
  dynamicLayers: i,
  featureLayers: o,
  markerLayers: a,
  nonClusteredMarkerLayers: s,
  clusteredMarkerLayers: l,
  heatmapLayers: h,
  focusedMarkers: p,
  selectedLayers: g,
  setSelectedLayers: A,
  onBaseLayerChange: y,
  onCustomMapLayerSelectionChange: b
})&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single component consumes the Esri API key alongside every layer type: base maps, dynamic overlays, feature layers, clustered and non-clustered markers, and heatmaps. Layer selection state is managed uniformly across all data sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internal permission flags from JavaScript bundles confirm FlockOS's role as the unified interface:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;canUseFlockOS911&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;canUseCAD&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;canDispatchDrone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;canManageIntegrations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FlockOS is the interface; ArcGIS is the substrate. The exposed API key granted access to the common mapping layer where all Flock Safety applications converge: camera inventories, mobile units, detection outputs, hotlists, search geometries, drone telemetry, Raven analytics, officer-accessible views, and Flock911 incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Exposed Data Categories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Surveillance Infrastructure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Camera deployments operated by police departments, communities, and private businesses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Third-party devices connected via Wing Gateways&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Raven audio gunshot detection sensors&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Law Enforcement Location Data&lt;/head&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Live and historical patrol car GPS positions&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Officer mobile app location data (phone, smartwatch)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trailers and auxiliary GPS trackers&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;People and Vehicle Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;People detection alerts with camera IDs, time windows, confidence thresholds, and expiration timestamps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;People searches rendered as tracked objects on the map&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vehicle alerts and vehicle description alerts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vehicle searches persisted alongside detections&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audio alerts including gunshot detection popups with classification (single shot vs. multiple shots)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hotlists and Investigative Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hotlist detections with topic names, alert reasons, filter IDs, deduplicated detection IDs, license plate numbers, and time/location data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Saved search filters—analyst searches persisted as spatial objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search footprints—the actual polygons and radii investigators draw when selecting geographic areas of interest&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Personally Identifiable Information&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Camera registrant names&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Email addresses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Phone numbers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Location types (law enforcement, non-law enforcement, private)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Postal addresses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Counts of interior and exterior cameras per location&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arrays of associated camera locations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Camera Registry and Asset Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each camera record exposed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Physical deployment location&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Device serial numbers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Device uptime percentages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Operational status&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flock support and service metadata&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Flock911 Emergency Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A dedicated ArcGIS FeatureServer layer for Flock911 incidents exposed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Live incident locations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Call IDs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transcript access tokens&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Per-word transcript timing data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audio scrub positions and playback state&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Incident classification&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Active and selected incident identifiers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Audio and transcript data flows through the same map context as cameras, patrol units, and alerts. No separate security boundary exists at the mapping layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drone Telemetry (Aerodome Integration)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every status chip rendered on the patrol/device tray (via hQ) only recognizes the values: &lt;code&gt;Docked&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Buffering&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Recording&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Inactive&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Offline&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ONLINE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Charging&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Uploading&lt;/code&gt;. Statuses in the "online/charging/buffering" group render as green; "inactive/offline/off" renders gray; and "recording" renders red. This confirms the complete set of device states actively rendered on the shared map UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pattern of Credential Exposure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exposed Default API Key was not an isolated incident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I separately disclosed an additional critical vulnerability involving unauthenticated ArcGIS token minting. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to obtain valid ArcGIS tokens scoped to Flock Safety's production environment from their development environment, tokens titled "Flock Safety Prod" that grant access to the geographic mapping of Flock's camera network locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 13, 2025 — Initial disclosure sent to Flock Safety security team&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 14, 2025 — First follow-up requesting confirmation of receipt&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 19, 2025 — Second follow-up; Flock Safety finally acknowledges receipt&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;January 7, 2026 — Vulnerability remains unpatched (55+ days)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am withholding specific technical details to prevent exploitation while the vulnerability remains unpatched. However, its existence more than 55 days after responsible disclosure with no remediation, demonstrates a systemic pattern of credential mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Comparing the Exposed Credentials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Yes (via item access)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Yes (direct FeatureLayer)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Dev site JS bundles&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Unauthenticated token minting&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Status&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fixed (June 2025)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Unpatched (55+ days)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both keys operated under the same active subscription with nearly one million available credits. Critically, development environments were configured with broader access than production, and those development sites were publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scope Limitations and Evidentiary Standard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 50 "portal:app:access:item" privileges reference private item IDs that cannot be inventoried without actively querying each one which I did not do. However, ArcGIS collaboration features allow partner organizations to share layers into another organization's portal, and evidence suggests this capability was actively used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An individual at a sheriff's office with an active Flock deployment confirmed during the course of this research that their agency shares ArcGIS layers directly with Flock Safety's organization. This corroborates the technical architecture documented in Esri's collaboration documentation and aligns with the privilege structure observed in the exposed credential metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I can state with certainty:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The API key's metadata explicitly listed 50 &lt;code&gt;portal:app:access:item:&lt;/code&gt;privileges granting access to private ArcGIS items&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Esri's own documentation confirms that such privileges grant access to "hosted feature services, web maps, web scenes, tile layers" and other private portal content&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A law enforcement source with direct knowledge of their agency's Flock integration confirmed that layer sharing with Flock Safety's ArcGIS organization occurs in practice&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The key appeared across 53 publicly accessible endpoints with no referrer restrictions, IP limitations, or access controls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many of the photo's I've used as examples are from publicly exposed ArcGIS datasets owned by Police Departments, that have relevant Flock Safety data in them.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings establish that the exposed credential provided a viable technical pathway to access shared law enforcement data. The precise contents of each private layer remain unverified, yet the circumstantial evidence is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why This Matters: National Security Implications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Intelligence Value of Movement Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foreign intelligence services would not need access to communications content if they could reliably observe movement at this scale. Historical location data revealing the presence, routines, and associations of politicians, federal agents, intelligence personnel, military leadership, or special operations units constitutes intelligence in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario: If members of SEAL Team 6 or Delta Force disappear from roadways for several days, that absence is itself a signal. If, during the same timeframe, a primary French translator also vanishes from routine movement patterns, the signal sharpens. A coordinated absence across these roles would strongly suggest the initiation of a special operations mission inferred solely from movement data collected by a nationwide license plate reader network. A top secret clearance wouldn't be needed for top secret information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has previously compromised hotel infrastructure for years at a time, not to surveil ordinary guests, but to capture rare overlaps where officials from different countries stayed in the same location on the same night. (Source) If adversaries are willing to infiltrate hotel systems for fragments of movement data, the intelligence value of a nationwide, centralized surveillance map should be self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Domestic Risks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Persistent, indiscriminate movement tracking enables coercion, blackmail, and influence operations that do not require access to communications content. Members of Congress, senior military leaders, diplomats, corporate executives and their spouses and children are all placed at heightened risk. With sufficient coverage and time, patterns of life emerge. Affairs, undisclosed meetings, sensitive relationships, and routine behaviors become visible once movement data is collected and correlated at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a theoretical concern. The documented history of law enforcement misuse of license plate reader systems, including Flock's own platforms, demonstrates that access to movement data is routinely weaponized for personal purposes by those entrusted with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Documented Cases of Flock Camera Misuse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Braselton, Georgia (November 2025): Police Chief Michael Steffman was arrested and charged with stalking, harassment, and multiple counts of misusing automated license plate recognition systems after a months-long Georgia Bureau of Investigation probe revealed he used Flock cameras to track and harass multiple individuals. Steffman resigned hours before his arrest after serving the department for 20 years. Subsequent public records analysis by the grassroots coalition Get The Flock Out revealed that Steffman had searched Flock data from agencies in other states, including Capitola, California, demonstrating the cross-jurisdictional reach enabled by Flock's network sharing capabilities. (Source)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sedgwick, Kansas (2023–2024): Police Chief Lee Nygaard used Flock Safety license plate readers to track his ex-girlfriend's vehicle 164 times and her new boyfriend's vehicle 64 times over a four-month period. He logged false justifications including "missing child," "drug investigation," and "suspicious activity" to conceal the personal nature of his searches. Nygaard also followed the couple in his patrol vehicle outside city limits. He resigned during the misconduct investigation. His police certification was revoked, though he faced no criminal charges. (Source)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange City, Florida (2024–2025): Officer Jarmarus Brown was arrested and charged with stalking and unauthorized computer access after using Flock license plate readers to track his ex-girlfriend's whereabouts for approximately seven months. An audit revealed he had repeatedly run tags for three specific vehicles. A fellow officer had warned Brown to "stop running her vehicle in that system because he could get in trouble" a warning Brown ignored. Brown also placed a GPS AirTag in the victim's wallet without her knowledge. When confronted by investigators, Brown admitted the situation was "dumb as hell on my end." He was served termination paperwork following his arrest. (Source)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These cases share common patterns: trusted officials often in leadership positions weaponizing surveillance tools against women with no connection to criminal investigations. The systems provided few meaningful barriers to misuse, and detection typically occurred only after victims independently reported suspicious behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Congressional Concerns Validated&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My research directly supports Senator Ron Wyden's claims that "Flock cannot live up to its commitment to protect the privacy and security of Oregonians" (Letter to Flock) and his urging for the "Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigate Flock Safety... and, where appropriate, hold the company responsible for its negligent cybersecurity practices" (Letter to FTC).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On Flock's Security Claims&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the City of Staunton canceled its Flock Safety contract, CEO Garrett Langley sent an unsolicited email to Staunton Police Department (source) stating:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"I'm writing to you directly because I want there to be zero confusion about what's happening. Flock has never been hacked. Ever."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That statement is technically correct only in the narrowest sense. The absence of a breach was not the result of internal security controls, audits, or monitoring but of responsible disclosure. I identified the vulnerability and reported it so it could be remediated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The absence of a hack does not imply the presence of security. Had this credential been found by anyone else, this may have been one of the largest data breaches and national security incidents of this decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;On Compliance Claims&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the same communication, Flock asserted:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"Flock is CJIS compliant"&lt;lb/&gt;"Flock adheres to the highest security standards, including NDAA, SOC 2 (Type II), SOC 3, ISO 27001, HECVAT, FERPA, and alignment with NIST and CAIQ."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a cybersecurity professional who has conducted dozens of compliance assessments, these statements are familiar. Compliance frameworks are often mistaken for guarantees of security, when in reality they are scoped evaluations of specific controls, not comprehensive examinations of an organization's risk posture. The scope of what is tested is defined by the company being assessed, which means compliance reflects what was reviewed, not everything that exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I requested access to Flock's audit reports; they were not provided. What I can say is this: a default, organization-wide API key embedded across 53 publicly reachable development and production-adjacent web assets would not survive even a basic review for exposed secrets or subdomains. Its persistence strongly suggests that this attack surface was either excluded from the assessment scope or insufficiently tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a default, organization-wide credential persists across 53 publicly reachable assets, the failure is not merely procedural, it is architectural. The exposed surface was not a peripheral feature or isolated test environment. It was development infrastructure configured with privileges that would have granted access to private ArcGIS items shared within Flock Safety's organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're a resident: File a public records request for your city's Flock Safety contract and any internal audit logs. Attend the next city council meeting where surveillance procurement is discussed. The EFF maintains a Street-Level Surveillance resource for tracking these deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're a journalist: The technical evidence presented here is a starting point. I'm available for follow-up. There are more threads to pull.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're in law enforcement: Ask your vendor hard questions. Request their penetration test results. Demand to know where your agency's data lives and who else can access it. Your officers' safety depends on infrastructure that adversaries cannot trivially compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're a policymaker: Senator Wyden's letters to Flock and the FTC are public record. Support an investigation. Mandate independent security audits for any vendor handling law enforcement location data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the API key has now been rotated, the lesson remains. If a single cybersecurity researcher in his early twenties could gain direct technical access to an exposure of this magnitude, a well-resourced foreign adversary operating with intent could observe far more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock Safety did not merely leak an API key. They exposed the operational heartbeat of the nation, and they did so repeatedly, across 53 separate instances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That reality should concern everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How Markdown took over the world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly every bit of the high-tech world, from the most cutting-edge AI systems at the biggest companies, to the casual scraps of code cobbled together by college students, is annotated and described by the same, simple plain text format. Whether you’re trying to give complex instructions to ChatGPT, or you want to be able to exchange a grocery list in Apple Notes or copy someone’s homework in Google Docs, that same format will do the trick. The wild part is, the format wasn’t created by a conglomerate of tech tycoons, it was created by a curmudgeonly guy with a kind heart who right this minute is probably rewatching a Kubrick film while cheering for an absolutely indefensible sports team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s worth understanding how these simple little text files were born, not just because I get to brag about how generous and clever my friends are, but also because it reminds us of how the Internet really works: smart people think of good things that are crazy enough that they just might work, and then they give them away, over and over, until they slowly take over the world and make things better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making Their Mark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though it’s now a building block of the contemporary Internet, like so many great things, Markdown just started out trying to solve a personal problem. In 2002, John Gruber made the unconventional decision to bet his online career on two completely irrational foundations: Apple, and blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to remember now, but in 2002, Apple was just a few years past having been on death’s door. As difficult as it may be to picture in today’s world where Apple keynotes are treated like major events, back then, almost nobody was covering Apple regularly, let alone writing exclusively about the company. There was barely even an “tech news” scene online at all, and virtually no one was blogging. So John’s decision to go all-in on Apple for his pioneering blog Daring Fireball was, well, a daring one. At the time, Apple had only just launched its first iPod that worked with Windows computers, and the iPhone was still a full five years in the future. But that single-minded focus, not just on Apple, but on obsessive detail in everything he covered, eventually helped inspire much of the technology media landscape that we see today. John’s timing was also perfect — from the doldrums of that era, Apple’s stock price would rise by about 120,000% in the years after Daring Fireball started, and its cultural relevance probably increased by even more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2004, it wasn’t just Apple that had begun to take off: blogs and social media themselves had moved from obscurity to the very center of culture, and a new era of web technology had begun. At the beginning of that year, few people in the world even knew what a “blog” was, but by the end of 2004, blogs had become not just ubiquitous, but downright cool. As unlikely as it seems now, that year’s largely uninspiring slate of U.S. presidential candidates like Wesley Clark, Gary Hart and, yes, Howard Dean helped propel blogs into mainstream awareness during the Democratic primaries, alongside online pundits who had begun weighing in on politics and the issues and cultural moments at a pace that newspapers and TV couldn’t keep up with. A lot has been written about the transformation of media during those years, but less has been written about how the media and tech of the time transformed each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That era of early blogging was interesting in that nearly everyone who was writing the first popular sites was also busy helping create the tools for publishing them. Just like Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz had to pioneer combining studio-style flat lighting with 35mm filming in order to define the look of the modern sitcom, or Jimi Hendrix had to work with Roger Mayer to invent the signature guitar distortion pedals that defined the sound of rock and roll, the pioneers who defined the technical format and structures of blogging were often building the very tools of creation as they went along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got a front row seat to these acts of creation. At the time I was working on Movable Type, which was the most popular tool for publishing “serious” blogs, and helped popularize the medium. Two of my good friends had built the tool and quickly made it into the default choice for anybody who wanted to reach a big audience; it was kind of a combination of everything people do these days on WordPress and all the various email newsletter platforms and all of the “serious” podcasts (since podcasts wouldn’t be invented for another few months). But back in those early days, we’d watch people use our tools to set up Gawker or Huffington Post one day, and Daring Fireball or Waxy.org the next, and each of them would be the first of its kind, both in terms of its design and its voice. To this day, when I see something online that I love by Julianne Escobedo Shepherd or Ta-Nehisi Coates or Nilay Patel or Annalee Newitz or any one of dozens of other brilliant writers or creators, my first thought is often, “hey! They used to type in that app that I used to make!” Because sometimes those writers would inspire us to make a new feature in the publishing tools, and sometimes they would have hacked up a new feature all by themselves in between typing up their new blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A really clear, and very simple, early example of how we learned that lesson was when we changed the size of the box that people used to type in just to create the posts on their sites. We made the box a little bit taller, mostly for aesthetic reasons. Within a few weeks, we’d found that posts on sites like Gawker had gotten longer, mostly because the box was bigger. This seems obvious now, years after we saw tweets get longer when Twitter expanded from 140 characters to 280 characters, but at the time this was a terrifying glimpse at how much power a couple of young product managers in a conference room in California would have over the media consumption of the entire world every time they made a seemingly-insignificant decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other dirty little secret was, typing in the box in that old blogging app could be… pretty wonky sometimes. People who wanted to do normal things like include an image or link in their blog post, or even just make some text bold, often had to learn somewhat-obscure HTML formatting, memorizing the actual language that’s used to make web pages. Not everybody knew all the details of how to make pages that way, and if they made even one small mistake, sometimes they could break the whole design of their site. It made things feel very fraught every time a writer went to publish something new online, and got in the way of the increasingly-fast pace of sharing ideas now that social media was taking over the public conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter John and his magical text files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Marking up and marking down&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The purpose of Markdown is really simple: It lets you use the regular characters on your keyboard which you already use while typing out things like emails, to make fancy formatting of text for the web. That HTML format that’s used to make web pages stands for HyperText Markup Language. The word “markup” there means you’re “marking up” your text with all kinds of special characters. Only, the special characters can be kind of arcane. Want to put in a link to everybody’s favorite website? Well, you’re going to have to type in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href="https://anildash.com/"&amp;gt;Anil Dash’s blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; I could explain why, and what it all means, but honestly, you get the point — it’s a lot! Too much. What if you could just write out the text and then the link, sort of like you might within an email? Like: &lt;code&gt;[Anil Dash’s blog](https://anildash.com)&lt;/code&gt;! And then the right thing would happen. Seems great, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same thing works for things like putting a header on a page. For example, as I’m writing this right now, if I want to put a big headline on this page, I can just type &lt;code&gt;#How Markdown Took Over the World&lt;/code&gt; and the right thing will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If mark_up_ is complicated, then the opposite of that complexity must be… markd_own_. This kind of solution, where it’s so smart it seems obvious in hindsight, is key to Markdown’s success. John worked to make a format that was so simple that anybody could pick it up in a few minutes, and powerful enough that it could help people express pretty much anything that they wanted to include while writing on the internet. At a technical level, it was also easy enough to implement that John could write the code himself to make it work with Movable Type, his publishing tool of choice. (Within days, people had implemented the same feature for most of the other blogging tools of the era; these days, virtually every app that you can type text into ships with Markdown support as a feature on day one.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to launch, John had enlisted our mutual friend, the late, dearly missed Aaron Swartz, as a beta tester. In addition to being extremely fluent in every detail of the blogging technologies of the time, Aaron was, most notably, seventeen years old. And though Aaron’s activism and untimely passing have resulted in him having been turned into something of a mythological figure, one of the greatest things about Aaron was that he could be a total pain in the ass, which made him terrific at reporting bugs in your software. (One of the last email conversations I ever had with Aaron was him pointing out some obscure bugs in an open source app I was working on at the time.) No surprise, Aaron instantly understood both the potential and the power of Markdown, and was a top-tier beta tester for the technology as it was created. His astute feedback helped finely hone the final product so it was ready for the world, and when Markdown quietly debuted in March of 2004, it was clear that text files around the web were about to get a permanent upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most surprising part of what happened next wasn’t that everybody immediately started using it to write their blogs; that was, after all, what the tool was designed to do. It’s that everybody started using Markdown to do everything else, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hitting the Mark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s almost impossible to overstate the ubiquity of Markdown within the modern computer industry in the decades since its launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After being nagged about it by users for more than a decade, Google finally added support for Markdown to Google Docs, though it took them years of fiddly improvements to make it truly usable. Just last year, Microsoft added support for Markdown to its venerable Notepad app, perhaps in attempt to assuage the tempers of users who were still in disbelief that Notepad had been bloated with AI features. Nearly every powerful group messaging app, from Slack to WhatsApp to Discord, has support for Markdown in messages. And even the company that indirectly inspired all of this in the first place finally got on board: the most recent version of Apple Notes finally added support for Markdown. (It’s an especially striking launch by Apple due to its timing, shortly after John had used his platform as the most influential Apple writer in the world to blog about the utter failure of the “Apple Intelligence” AI launch.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s not just the apps that you use on your phone or your laptop. For developers, Markdown has long been the lingua franca of the tools we string together to accomplish our work. On GitHub, the platform that nearly every developer in the world uses to share their code, nearly every single repository of code on the site has at least one Markdown file that’s used to describe its contents. Many have dozens of files describing all the different aspects of their project. And some of the repositories on GitHub consist of nothing but massive collections of Markdown files. The small tools and automations we run to perform routine tasks, the one-off reports that we generate to make sure something worked correctly, the confirmations that we have a system email out when something goes wrong, the temporary files we use when trying to recover some old data — all of these default to being Markdown files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, there are now billions of Markdown files lying around on hard drives around the world. Billions more are stashed in the cloud. There are some on the phone in your pocket. Programmers leave them lying around wherever their code might someday be running. Your kid’s Nintendo Switch has Markdown files on it. If you’re listening to music, there’s probably a Markdown file on the memory chip of the tiny system that controls the headphones stuck in your ears. The Markdown is inside you right now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Down For Whatever&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, these were all things we could have foreseen when John first unleashed his little text tool on the world. I would have been surprised about how many people were using it, but not really the ways in which they were using it. If you’d have said “Twenty years in the future, all the different note-taking apps people use save their files using Markdown!”, I would have said, “Okay, that makes sense!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I wouldn’t have asked, though, was “Is John getting paid?” As hard as it may be to believe, back in 2004, the default was that people made new standards for open technologies like Markdown, and just shared them freely for the good of the internet, and the world, and then went on about their lives. If it happened to have unleashed billions of dollars of value for others, then so much the better. If they got some credit along the way, that was great, too. But mostly you just did it to solve a problem for yourself and for other like-minded people. And also, maybe, to help make sure that some jerk didn’t otherwise create some horrible proprietary alternative that would lock everybody into their terrible inferior version forever instead. (We didn’t have the word “enshittification” yet, but we did have Cory Doctorow and we did have plain text files, so we kind of knew where things were headed.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give a sense of the vibe of that era, the term “podcasting” had been coined just a month before Markdown was released, and went into wider use that fall, and was similarly a radically open system that wasn’t owned by any big company and that empowered people to do whatever they wanted to do to express themselves. (And podcasting was another technology that Aaron Swartz helped improve by being a brilliant pain in the ass. But I’ll save that story for another book-length essay.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That attitude of being not-quite-_anti_commercial, but perhaps just not even really concerned with whether something was commercial or not seems downright quaint in an era when the tech tycoons are not just the wealthiest people in the world, but also some of the weirdest and most obnoxious as well. But the truth is, most people today who make technology are actually still exceedingly normal, and quite generous. It’s just that they’ve been overshadowed by their bosses who are out of their minds and building rocket ships and siring hundreds of children and embracing overt white supremacy instead of making fun tools for helping you type text, like regular people do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Markdown Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The part about not doing this stuff solely for money matters, because even the most advanced LLM systems today, what the big AI companies call their “frontier” models, require complex orchestration that’s carefully scripted by people who’ve tuned their prompts for these systems through countless rounds of trial and error. They’ve iterated and tested and watched for the results as these systems hallucinated or failed or ran amok, chewing up countless resources along the way. And sometimes, they generated genuinely astonishing outputs, things that are truly amazing to consider that modern technology can achieve. The rate of progress and evolution, even factoring in the mind-boggling amounts of investment that are going into these systems, is rivaled only by the initial development of the personal computer or the Internet, or the early space race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And all of it — all of it — is controlled through Markdown files. When you see the brilliant work shown off from somebody who’s bragging about what they made ChatGPT generate for them, or someone is understandably proud about the code that they got Claude to create, all of the most advanced work has been prompted in Markdown. Though where the logic of Markdown was originally a very simple version of "use human language to tell the machine what to do", the implications have gotten far more dire when they use a format designed to help expresss "make this &lt;code&gt;**bold**&lt;/code&gt;" to tell the computer itself "&lt;code&gt;make this imaginary girlfriend more compliant&lt;/code&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we already know that the Big AI companies are run by people who don't reckon with the implications of their work. They could never understand that every single project that's even moderately ambitious on these new AI platforms is being written up in files formatted according to this system created by one guy who has never asked for a dime for this work. An entire generation of AI coders has been born since Markdown was created who probably can’t even imagine that this technology even has an "inventor". It’s just always been here, like the Moon, or Rihanna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s important for everyone to know that the Internet, and the tech industry, don’t run without the generosity and genius of regular people. It is not just billion-dollar checks and Silicon Valley boardrooms that enable creativity over years, decades, or generations — it’s often a guy with a day job who just gives a damn about doing something right, sweating the details and assuming that if he cares enough about what he makes then others will too. The majority of the technical infrastructure of the Internet was created in this way. For free, often by people in academia, or as part of their regular work, with no promise of some big payday or getting a ton of credit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who make the real Internet and the real innovations also don’t look for ways to hurt the world around them, or the people around them. Sometimes, as in the case of Aaron, the world hurts them more than anyone should ever have to bear. I know not everybody cares that much about plain text files on the Internet; I will readily admit I am a huge nerd about this stuff in a way that maybe most normal people are not. But I do think everybody cares about some part of the wonderful stuff on the Internet in this way, and I want to fight to make sure that everybody can understand that it’s not just five terrible tycoons who built this shit. Real people did. Good people. I saw them do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trillion-dollar AI industry's system for controlling their most advanced platforms is a plain text format one guy made up for his blog and then bounced off of a 17-year-old kid before sharing it with the world for free. You're welcome, Time Magazine's people of the year, The Architects of AI. Their achievement is every bit as impressive as yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Ten Technical Reasons Markdown Won&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, with some of the narrative covered, what can we learn from Markdown’s success? How did this thing really take off? What could we do if we wanted to replicate something like this in the modern era? Let’s consider a few key points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Had a great brand.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s be real: “Markdown” as a name is clever as hell. Get it it’s not markup, it’s mark down. You just can’t argue with that kind of logic. People who knew what the “M” in “HTML” stood for could understand the reference, and to everyone else, it was just a clearly-understandable name for a useful utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Solved a real problem.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is not obvious, but it’s really important that a new technology have a real problem that it’s trying to solve, instead of just being an abstract attempt to do something vague, like “make text files better”. Millions of people were encountering the idea that it was too difficult or inconvenient to write out full HTML by hand, and even if one had the necessary skills, it was nice to be able to do so in a format that was legible as plain text as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Built on behaviors that already existed.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is one of the most quietly genius parts of Markdown: The format is based on the ways people had been adding emphasis and formatting to their text for years or even decades. Some of the formatting choices dated back to the early days of email, so they’d been ingrained in the culture of the internet for a full generation before Markdown existed. It was so familiar, people could be writing Markdown without even knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Mirrored RSS in its origin.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around the same time that Markdown was taking off, RSS was maturing into its ubiquitous form as well. The format had existed for some years already, enabling various kinds of content syndication, but at this time, it was adding support for the technologies that would come to be known as podcasting as well. And just like RSS, Markdown was spearheaded by a smart technologist who was also more than a little stubborn about defining a format that would go on to change the way we share content on the internet. In RSS’ case, it was pioneered by Dave Winer, and with Markdown it was John Gruber, and both were tireless in extolling the virtues of the plain text formats they’d helped pioneer. They could both leverage blogs to get the word out, and to get feedback on how to build on their wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;5. There was a community ready to help.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One great thing about a format like Markdown is that its success is never just the result of one person. Vitally, Markdown was part of a community that could build on it right from the start. Right from the beginning, Markdown was inspired by earlier works like Textile, a formatting system for plain text created by Dean Allen. Many of us appreciated and were inspired by Dean, who was a pioneer of blogging tools in the early days of social media, but if there’s a bigger fan of Dean Allen on the internet than John Gruber, I’ve never met them. Similarly, Aaron Swartz, the brilliant young technologist who’s known best known as an activist for digital rights and access, was at that time just a super brilliant teenager that a lot of us loved hacking with. He was the most valuable beta tester of Markdown prior to its release, helping to shape it into a durable and flexible format that’s stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6. Had the right flavor for every different context.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Markdown’s format was frozen in place (and had some super-technical details that people could debate about) and people wanted to add features over time, various communities that were implementing Markdown could add their own “flavors” of it as they needed. Popular ones came to be called Commonmark and Github-Flavored, led by various companies or teams that had divergent needs for the tool. While tech geeks tend to obsess over needing everything to be “correct”, in reality it often just doesn’t matter that much, and in the real world, the entire Internet is made up of content that barely follows the technical rules that it’s supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;7. Released at a time of change in behaviors and habits.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a subtle point, but an important one: Markdown came along at the right time in the evolution of its medium. You can get people to change their behaviors when they’re using a new tool, or adopting a new technology. In this case, blogging (and all of social media!) were new, so saying “here’s a new way of typing a list of bullet points” wasn’t much an additional learning curve to add to the mix. If you can take advantage of catching people while they’re already in a learning mood, you can really tap into the moment when they’re most open-minded to new things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;8. Came right on the cusp of the “build tool era”.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one’s a bit more technical, but also important to understand. In the first era of building for the web, people often built the web’s languages of HTML, Javascript and CSS by hand, by themselves, or stitched these formats together from subsets or templates. But in many cases, these were fairly simple compositions, made up of smaller pieces that were written in the same languages. As things matured, the roles for web developers specialized (there started to be backend developers vs. front-end, or people who focused on performance vs. those who focused on visual design), and as a result the tooling for developers matured. On the other side of this transition, developers began to use many different programming languages, frameworks and tools, and the standard step before trying to deploy a website was to have an automated build process that transformed the “raw materials” of the site into the finished product. Since Markdown is a raw material that has to be transformed into HTML, it perfectly fit this new workflow as it became the de facto standard method of creation and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;9. Worked with “View source”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the technologies that work best on the web enable creators to “view source” just like HTML originally did when the first web browsers were created. In this philosophy, one can look at the source code that makes up a web page, and understand how it was constructed so that you can make your own. With Markdown, it only takes one glimpse of a source Markdown file for anyone to understand how they might make a similar file of their own, or to extrapolate how they might apply analogous formatting to their own documents. There’s no teaching required when people can just see it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;10. Not encumbered in IP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one’s obvious if you think about it, but it can’t go unsaid: There are no legal restrictions around Markdown. You wouldn’t think that anybody would be foolish or greedy enough to try to patent something as simple as Markdown, but there are many far worse examples of patent abuse in the tech industry. Fortunately, John Gruber is not an awful person, and nobody else has (yet) been brazen enough to try to usurp the format for their own misadventures in intellectual property law. As a result, nobody’s been afraid, either to use the format, or to support creating or reading the format in their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;A large review of studies suggests that exercise can ease depression about as effectively as psychological therapy. Compared with antidepressants, exercise showed similar benefits, though the evidence was less certain. Researchers found that light to moderate activity over multiple sessions worked best, with few side effects. While itâs not a cure-all, exercise may be a powerful and accessible tool for many people.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Share:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity may ease symptoms of depression about as effectively as psychological therapy, according to an updated Cochrane review. When researchers compared exercise with antidepressant medication, they found similar benefits, although the certainty of that evidence was lower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depression remains a major global health challenge, affecting more than 280 million people worldwide and contributing significantly to disability. Exercise stands out as a low cost and widely accessible option that also improves physical health, making it appealing to both patients and healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the Cochrane Review&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analysis was led by researchers at the University of Lancashire and drew on data from 73 randomized controlled trials involving nearly 5,000 adults diagnosed with depression. These studies examined how exercise compared with no treatment or control conditions, as well as with psychological therapies and antidepressant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings showed that exercise led to moderate reductions in depressive symptoms compared with no treatment. When measured against psychological therapy, exercise produced similar improvements, based on moderate certainty evidence from ten trials. Comparisons with antidepressant medication also suggested comparable effects, but the supporting evidence was limited and considered low certainty. Few studies tracked participants after treatment ended, leaving the long-term impact unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safety and Side Effects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reported side effects were uncommon. People in exercise programs occasionally experienced muscle or joint injuries, while those taking antidepressants reported typical medication-related issues such as fatigue and gastrointestinal problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression," said Professor Andrew Clegg, lead author of the review. "This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Kind of Exercise Works Best&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The review found that light to moderate intensity activity may be more helpful than vigorous workouts. Greater improvements in depressive symptoms were linked to completing between 13 and 36 exercise sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No single form of exercise clearly outperformed others. However, programs that combined different types of activity and resistance training appeared more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Some activities, including yoga, qigong and stretching, were not evaluated in this analysis and remain areas for future study. As with other findings, long-term benefits are still uncertain due to limited follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Conclusions Remain Cautious&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This update added 35 new trials to earlier versions of the review published in 2008 and 2013. Even with the expanded evidence base, the main conclusions changed little. Many of the included studies were small, often involving fewer than 100 participants, which makes it harder to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Although we've added more trials in this update, the findings are similar," said Professor Clegg. "Exercise can help people with depression, but if we want to find which types work best, for who and whether the benefits last over time, we still need larger, high-quality studies. One large, well-conducted trial is much better than numerous poor quality small trials with limited numbers of participants in each."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For best accuracy, use Ollama v0.1.26+ with models supporting the &lt;code&gt;logprobs&lt;/code&gt; parameter (Llama 3.2+, Mistral 7B+).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;RAM: 16GB DDR4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PCIe: M.2 Gen3 x4&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More powerful than the Raspberry Pi 5, but at a similar price point. It also has a potential advantage for running games, since it’s not ARM-based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the photo, you can see the default configuration (SSD in the fast PCIe slot). For this experiment, I’ll move it into the slower (x1) slot and plug the eGPU into the faster (x4) slot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Radxa ROCK 5B&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU: 8-core RK3588 (4× Cortex-A76 @ 2.4GHz + 4× Cortex-A55 @ 1.8GHz)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAM: 16GB DDR4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PCIe: M.2 Gen3 x4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Also: Aftermarket heat sink &amp;amp; fan combo&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty comparable to the Raspberry Pi 5 (it’s ARM), but the extra cores give it a little more horsepower. The faster PCIe slot is also included on-board. Since the PCIe slot will be taken for the GPU, we’ll just use a USB SSD for both ARM boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU: 4-core BCM2712 (Cortex-A76 @ 2.4GHz)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAM: 16GB DDR4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PCIe: M.2 Gen2 x1 (via NVme HAT)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Also: Aftermarket heat sink &amp;amp; fan combo&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why we’re all here. It’s the quintessential hobbyist SBC. Unfortunately it’s the most challenged: fewer cores, and significantly less PCIe bandwidth. The Pi 5’s Gen2 x1 slot provides ~500 MB/s, compared to ~4,000 MB/s on the Gen3 x4 slots of the other machines, an 8x difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;eGPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will be using a relatively inexpensive OCuLink dock to pair with our very expensive GPU. If you’re not familiar with the technology, it’s basically a PCIe extension cord to let you plug a graphics card into a computer that wouldn’t normally fit one. The dock is powered externally by a separate power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this experiment, we’re using an NVIDIA RTX 5090 Founders Edition (32GB VRAM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OCuLink cable plugs into an M.2 card that we’ll insert into each machine as we test it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Intel-based Beelink machine, from a software perspective the card is more or less indistinguishable from a normal graphics card. We can just install the normal NVIDIA drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ARM-based computers we’re testing have various quirks (lack of DMA coherence, memory alignment requirements, etc.) that make them incompatible with most GPU drivers out of the box. Luckily, @mariobalanca wrote some patches that allow the drivers to work on these systems. NVIDIA already had some workarounds in the user-space part of their drivers for Ampere-based systems for memory alignment issues, so some of that gets inherited here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have packaged the drivers you can run on Ubuntu or Fedora here, if you’d like to try this yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve gotten this far and simply don’t believe this actually works, here’s a screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CPU Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we get into the games, let’s take a look at how these machines compare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most PC games are designed for Intel CPUs. If we want to play them on ARM we’ll have to use a compatibility layer called FEX. The graph shows not only the native performance of the machines, but also the significantly degraded performance under FEX. To be fair, FEX is an incredible feat of engineering, but all emulation comes at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 5 under FEX seems to have similar performance to a 2008 Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650. Not very promising. That said, gamers usually say that, for most games, it’s OK to skimp on CPU a bit as long as you have a good GPU. We will definitely be testing that line of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to find games that had built-in benchmarks that also worked under FEX, along with Steam’s Proton compatibility layer, tilting towards games that didn’t have as strong CPU requirements. It turns out this is actually not a huge list. Here are a handful that I tried:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 (2020)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, believe it or not, &lt;code&gt;vkcube&lt;/code&gt; is not the only thing you can run in this configuration. Through the maze of compatibility layers (FEX, WINE/Proton, DXVK, etc), you too can run Cyberpunk 2077 on your Raspberry Pi 5. The screenshot above is running at 1080p with Ultra Raytracing quality settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game is playable on the Beelink machine with some lower settings. Since it’s an Intel machine, I also tested the game on Windows for posterity. Usually it’s suggested that even with all the compatibility layers, Linux gaming can be faster, but not in this case on the lower settings here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These games really get CPU bound, caught up on these lower-spec CPUs. I think on a normal gaming PC, it wouldn’t matter as much, but every cycle starts to count here, and not all the abstractions provided by WINE are zero cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the Pi barely breaks 15 FPS, but on the ROCK 5B, it approaches playable on low settings. Granted, not sure how fun that would be at 22 FPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Doom: The Dark Ages (2025)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This game doesn’t run under FEX, so I didn’t collect full benchmarks here. The anti-cheat stuff is too weird and doesn’t get properly emulated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the benchmark does offer a unique view into the challenges these low-power PCs face.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see it running on the Beelink here. The GPU is absolutely shredding through the Ultra quality frames at 4K resolution, but the CPU is really struggling. You can see the GPU is able to process almost 90 FPS, but because of the bottleneck at the CPU, the overall frame rate can’t break 30 FPS. That’s the main challenge here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Alien: Isolation (2014)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My next thought was, maybe if we jump back a decade, we can have better luck. This game actually ships with a Linux port. Unfortunately the Linux port doesn’t include the built-in benchmark tool, so I ran it under Proton/WINE. I also found that DXVK caused every game from this point onward to crash immediately on the ARM hosts, so I run the games with &lt;code&gt;PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1&lt;/code&gt; to fall back to the OpenGL renderer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar: DXVK translates DirectX calls to Vulkan, while WineD3D translates them to OpenGL. The GPU driver, when running on ARM, has a Vulkan implementation that apparently has issues when running under FEX that OpenGL avoids. Something to keep in mind if you’re trying to replicate this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, not the best looking game by modern standards, even on Ultra settings. It does have some cool lighting effects, at least. I admit I have never played this game for real, so I can’t vouch for it being fun or not. I just ran the benchmark tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I initially tested this game on the Beelink and thought it looked promising. Relatively low CPU usage. It seems like it is playable on the ROCK 5B with an average 23 FPS. Not sure about the Pi though, at only 15 FPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hitman: Absolution (2012)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, OK. So we already know the performance of the Pi is on par with a PC from 2008, so I figured, let’s go back a couple more years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Couldn’t get the windowed mode to work right on this one, but I swear it’s running on the Raspberry Pi 5. You can probably tell from the FPS counter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would say the performance makes it basically unusable on these ARM machines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the Beelink really shines here. Windows perf is way ahead of Linux on this one too. More than playable on both, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was actually a little puzzled by this one. It seems like it shouldn’t be this bad on the ARM hosts. This feels like a performance bug, but it’s hard to say where in the stack it might be. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Just Cause 2 Demo (2010)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, so let’s go back another couple years. This demo was free, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So remember earlier when I said I had to disable DXVK for these games to run on ARM? On Intel Windows, I had to actually add DXVK because the game crashed immediately on launch. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 FPS average on a Raspberry Pi 5. 2010 is our year! Windows still dominates here. It’s more apples-to-apples on Beelink’s Linux vs Windows now since now both are using DXVK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Portal 2 (2011)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After I had run all of these, I was curious to try Portal 2. Valve is the company that maintains Proton and FEX. You’d think they maybe would have optimized it for their own games. It’s also old enough that it’s in the sweet spot of potentially being playable on the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, Portal 2 does not ship with a built-in benchmark. However, it does have a &lt;code&gt;timedemo&lt;/code&gt; feature where you can record yourself playing and then play it back as a benchmark. I picked a random level and recorded it. Then, ran it on the test systems. Since there was a native version, I benchmarked that alongside the Proton/WINE version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, now that we have a native Linux port to compare with, it totally leaves Windows in the dust (finally). Most importantly, the Raspberry Pi 5 can play this game at 4K resolution, way above 60 FPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I can now say with a straight face, that it’s possible to use the Raspberry Pi 5 to game in 4K, admittedly strapped to a GPU that’s roughly worth 10x the price of the Pi. In all seriousness, probably any lower-end GPU would work here. Clearly we’re not using the 5090 to its full potential anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Power Usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These machines are also known to be low power. I guess for a gaming computer, I’m not sure how important that is. You can just turn it off when you’re not using it. That said, a gaming PC CPU could use 20-50w while completely idle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these measurements I took the idle power usage and also average power usage during the Cyberpunk 4K Ultra Raytracing benchmark, both measured at the AC outlet. This does not include the GPU, just the CPU, since that’s what we’re really comparing here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 5 sips power at under 9W even under load, while the Beelink pulls almost 30W during the benchmark. One way of looking at it, is that the Beelink performs so much faster in games, and the amount of power is proportional to that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it, is if the ARM-based machines weren’t mired in emulating x86, they probably would have considerably better performance on per-watt basis compared to the Intel CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, can you game on a Raspberry Pi 5 with an RTX 5090? I guess, technically, yes. Would you want to? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modern games (2020+): Most likely unplayable. The CPU perf degradation under FEX is brutal. Even playing on the lowest 720p settings, Cyberpunk barely hits 16 FPS average on the Pi 5.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2010-era games: If you’re trying to play older games, you can probably get away with it. You also probably do not need a graphics card as powerful as the 5090.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beelink is the clear winner if you actually want to game. It’s still terrible, but it’s cheap, runs x86 natively, and with the right settings, it can hit 50 FPS+ in every game I tried. Windows consistently outperformed Linux on most WINE/Proton titles, so you’re probably better off just installing Windows on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ROCK 5B edges out the Raspberry Pi 5 slightly in most benchmarks, but not by much. The extra cores and PCIe bandwidth don’t seem to matter as much as the raw performance lost to FEX emulation. That said, it does bring the game from painfully playable to borderline playable in some games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given all the momentum around ARM (Valve is about to ship an ARM VR headset, and NVIDIA is rumored to ship their own SoC with an NVIDIA GPU soon), I think future platforms will probably be better optimized, and Linux gaming on ARM will probably be more plausible in the future. Sadly, I don’t recommend strapping your super expensive graphics card to a cheap SBC for now. Unless it’s just for a fun blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QtNat is a lightweight C++ library built with Qt 6 that simplifies NAT port mapping using UPnP (Universal Plug and Play). It is designed to help developers easily expose local services to external networks without requiring manual router configuration for users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By leveraging UPnP, QtNat automatically communicates with compatible routers to create port forwarding rules at runtime. This makes it particularly useful for peer-to-peer applications, multiplayer games, remote access tools, and any software that needs reliable inbound connectivity behind a NAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QtNat provides a simplified API to do all steps automatically: discovery and mapping. This has been tested on my local device. Feel free to test it and improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
    UpnpNat nat;

    QObject::connect(&amp;amp;nat, &amp;amp;UpnpNat::statusChanged, [&amp;amp;nat, &amp;amp;app]() {
        switch(nat.status())
        {
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_IDLE:
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_DISCOVERY:
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_GETDESCRIPTION:
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_DESCRIPTION_FOUND:
            break;
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_FOUND:
            nat.requestDescription();
            break;
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_READY:
            nat.addPortMapping("UpnpTest", nat.localIp(), 6664, 6664, "TCP");
            break;
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_ADD:
            qDebug() &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "It worked!";
            app.quit();

            app.exit(1);
            break;
        }
    });

    nat.discovery();

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We create the object (l:0)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We connect to statusChanged signal to get notified (l:2)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When status is NAT_FOUND, we request the description (l:11)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When status is NAT_READY, we request the port mapping (l:14)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When status is NAT_ADD, It means the port mapping request has been added, It worked! The application quits.(l:17)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When status is NAT_ERROR, Error occured and display the error text. The application exits on error. (l:21)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We connect to error changed in order to detect errors. (l:14)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We start the discovery. (l:28)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical explainations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The discovery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, we need to know if there is a upnp server around. To do so, we send an M-SEARCH request on the multicast address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;

            m_udpSocketV4-&amp;gt;readDatagram(datagram.data(), datagram.size());
        }

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole goal of the discovery is to get the description file from the server with all available devices and services. The result is stored in &lt;code&gt;m_describeUrl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Request Description file&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Your physical network device may act as several Upnp devices. You are looking for one of these device type:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those type are followed with a number (1 or 2), It is the Upnp protocol version supported by the device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, let’s create a json object with all data. As final step, we need to create a request, set its data, and then post it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
void UpnpNat::addPortMapping(const QString&amp;amp; description, const QString&amp;amp; destination_ip, unsigned short int port_ex,
                             unsigned short int port_in, const QString&amp;amp; protocol)
{
    inja::json subdata;
    subdata["description"]= description.toStdString();
    subdata["protocol"]= protocol.toStdString();
    subdata["service"]= m_serviceType.toStdString();
    subdata["port"]= port_in;
    subdata["ip"]= destination_ip.toStdString();

    auto text= QByteArray::fromStdString(inja::render(loadFile(key::envelop).toStdString(), subdata));

    QNetworkRequest request;
    request.setUrl(QUrl(m_controlUrl));
    QHttpHeaders headers;
    headers.append(QHttpHeaders::WellKnownHeader::ContentType, "text/xml;  charset=\"utf-8\"");
    headers.append("SOAPAction", QString("\"%1#AddPortMapping\"").arg(m_serviceType));
    request.setHeaders(headers);
    m_manager.post(request, text);
}

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Finally, just check the answer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reply has no error, it worked, the status changes to NAT_ADD. Otherwise, the status changes to error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
void UpnpNat::processAnswer(QNetworkReply* reply)
{
    if(reply-&amp;gt;error() != QNetworkReply::NoError)
    {
        setError(tr("Something went wrong: %1").arg(reply-&amp;gt;errorString()));
        setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_ERROR);
        return;
    }
    setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_ADD);
}

&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story started in March. A friend sent me a link to a small British movie she’d worked on that hadn’t yet been released. It had been shot in Wales over 18 days on a tiny budget, and as the closing credits rolled, my tearful husband [Richard Curtis] said he thought it was one of the best British films of all time. We offered to host a screening and invited anyone we knew with media influence to watch the masterpiece that is The Ballad of Wallis Island to help spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, the co-writer and star of the film, Tom Basden, arrived with a thank-you gift: a plastic pot with a leafy stick in the middle. To be honest, I’d have preferred a scented candle, but I was touched that he’d brought it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tom then told me the story of the plant. This scrubby little sprig was a cutting from his begonia, which had started life as a cutting given to him by his father-in-law, the writer Barry Walsh, who had been given his plant as a cutting by the casting director Corinne Rodriguez in 2017. Corinne’s begonia had grown from a cutting of a plant grown from one given to her by the actor Sally Miles in the 1970s. Sally’s had started life as a cutting she was given by the opera singer Kirsten Flagstad in the 50s. And Kirsten had been given her cutting in the 30s by her dear friend … Sigmund Freud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So there I was, moving from apathy to disbelief, holding the same plant my great-grandfather Sigmund had nurtured nearly 100 years ago. A cutting grows up to be a perfect clone of the original – no matter how many times you pass on cuttings of the cuttings of the cuttings, they’re all genetically identical to the original shrub. Sigmund died before I ever met him, but I now owned a tiny part of his story. A biological heirloom that had lived alongside him and brought oxygen into his pioneering study – growing alongside his evolving ideas, laying down roots as he laid down theories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sigmund Freud, who had form in horticultural gifting, nurtured the plant nearly a century ago after arriving in London in 1938&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Freud family all lived in Europe until my dad was eight, and were then together in north London for the last year of Sigmund’s life – he died when my dad was 15. But my father, Clement, was very uneasy about his grandfather’s legacy. He wouldn’t engage on the subject any more than by saying we should all stand on our two feet and not hang on to someone else’s coattails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He worked hard to make his own name and avoided the subject of psychology entirely, along with his other pet hates of cigarettes, garlic, chewing gum, nail varnish, music, perfume and Dr Scholl’s sandals. On one occasion when he appeared on the Johnny Carson chatshow in the US, he had it written into his contract that he wouldn’t answer questions about Sigmund. Carson obviously sensed a story and asked the grandfather question, so my dad answered at length about his mother’s father, who had been a banker in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time I was born, the word “Sigmund” was unmentionable in our house. The convent we attended was 100 yards from his old home in Hampstead, north London, and my sister once came home from school saying: “The nuns mentioned someone called Sigmund Freud and said I should know who he is.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The begonia is depicted by Portia Graves&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tom Basden, who gave Emma the begonia as a thank-you gift&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ah,” said my father in a serious tone (his only tone). “That’s awkward. He was my grandfather; he invented the flush toilet. If anyone mentions his name again, change the subject.” My sister believed this for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related articles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the five of us grew up with no knowledge whatsoever of our ancestry. There were no books by or about Sigmund in the house, no photos, stories, mementoes – just a freezing of the air if anyone ever mentioned him in dad’s company. Even now, 16 years after my father died, I’m feeling slightly frightened that I may get into trouble for writing about his grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So as I placed this stumpy green stick on the mantelpiece in my sitting room, I realised it was the only thing I have ever owned with any connection to the man who transformed the way we think about ourselves, and who was also my great-grandfather. He had been sitting in the shadows my entire life until – unexpectedly, in my 60s – someone I barely know shone a tiny light on him. Like a detective who has no idea what they’re looking for, I decided to dig deeper into the chain of events that led finally to my owning a tiny piece of this past.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I looked up the qualities of begonias and found they’re often given as a gift to repay a favour. I knew Tom had given me the cutting in gratitude, but why had his father-in-law given one to him?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BARRY&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barry Walsh – now virtually my best friend after the number of emails we’ve exchanged about pot plants – wanted to thank Tom for a family holiday he’d organised to Wales. But I’d like to imagine he was also thanking his son-in-law for giving us the fabulous sitcom Here We Go, being nominated for three Baftas, and generally being both funny and clever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now a novelist, Barry started his working life in the 70s as a press officer at the Mermaid theatre in London&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CORINNE&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barry is now a novelist, but had started his working life in the 70s as a press officer at the Mermaid theatre in London, where he worked alongside the renowned casting director Corinne Rodriguez. As a teenager, she was in charge of Liberace’s fan club, but was expelled for bunking off school to watch him. Without qualifications, she became a typist at the Royal Court theatre, before becoming its youngest casting director. In 2008, Corinne was diagnosed with cancer, and not long before she died, she gave Barry a gesture of thanks for their four decades of friendship: a cutting from the precious begonia that had been given to her by the actor Sally Miles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corinne Rodriguez gave a cutting to her long-time friend Barry Walsh (pictured together&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SALLY&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sally had a lot to be grateful to Corinne for. She’d cast Sally in many plays and productions. As well as acting, Sally was a singer, comedian, director and designer – a dynamo with the same work ethic as her father, the eccentric actor and director Bernard Miles, who spent much of his life with his pet parrot on his shoulder. Bernard ran the Mermaid theatre, where he’d employed the Norwegian opera legend Kirsten Flagstad, and it was there that Kirsten gave a cutting from her precious begonia to Sally. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sally, pictured with her father Bernard who ran the Mermaid theatre. She inherited a cutting from her godmother Kirsten, who was also her father’s muse&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KIRSTEN&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Considered the greatest Wagnerian soprano of the 20th century, she was as famous in her time as Maria Callas, but her career was damaged after the war when her husband was imprisoned under suspicion of Nazi involvement. Kirsten herself had strongly supported the resistance, but in 1947 American audiences booed her as she arrived on stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a blackened public image, the recently widowed Kirsten came to London in 1948 to perform in a fundraising concert for the United Jewish Appeal. It was there that she met Bernard Miles, and they instantly became friends. When she later visited his house in St John’s Wood, he showed her a large building still standing in his garden from the days when the house had been a school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It had a wonderful acoustic, and that afternoon, they made a deal that would go on to change one little corner of British theatre: if he refurbished the barn, she would perform on their opening night. The original Mermaid theatre, a 200-seat venue with an Elizabethan stage, opened in Bernard’s back garden in September 1951. It sold out its first 20 performances of Dido and Aeneas starring Kirsten as Dido and received rave reviews. There was a Mermaid theatre in London from that day for the next 57 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kirsten’s damaged reputation had made her vulnerable. She was grateful that Bernard had given her this chance to perform in London, and he was grateful that she’d launched his theatre. It was at this point that Bernard asked her to be Sally’s godmother, which Kirsten acknowledged by giving her new godchild a cutting from her precious begonia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sigmund gave a begonia cutting to the celebrated Norwegian opera singer in the 1930s. She moved to London soon after the war&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here’s the curious thing: Sally was 17, which is an odd time to gain a godmother. There must have been a reason why the Miles family wanted to cement Kirsten into their family, and I couldn’t work it out. I continued digging and found Kirsten’s contract for Dido at the Mermaid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Singer undertakes …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be obedient, tractable, sweet tempered and helpful in every possible way&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To let The Management look down her throat with a laryngoscope whenever they need encouragement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and she promises not to brag about the Vikings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The management undertakes…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To hold The Singer dear, to prize, treasure, cling to, dote on, adore and idolise her&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To supply her with 2 pints of oatmeal stout per diem, viz. lunch 1 half pint, dinner 1 half pint, and 1 pint following each performance&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give her little surprises, write her letters and poems, and take every opportunity to make her laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the professional contract you might expect a theatre to present to an iconic opera singer – it reads more like a playful love letter. Digging deeper, I found Alan Strachan’s biography of the Mermaid theatre, which contains Bernard’s admission that he “fell in love with [Kirsten] the moment I met her … I could see and think of nothing else for four or five years.” To a recently qualified amateur detective like me, this was a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It consequently turned out the Mileses were as unconventional at home as they were in their theatre. Bernard said that his wife, Josephine, “like a good wife, as always, wanted me to have what was good for me”. They were an unorthodox family. Josephine was herself having an affair with the female novelist Noel Streatfeild, who wrote Ballet Shoes. She clearly agreed to her husband’s girlfriend’s appointment as Sally’s godparent. Years later, Sally even called her daughter Dido, after Kirsten’s most famous opera role.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By this stage, I was becoming obsessed with my begonia’s history. I went in search of the original Mermaid theatre. Available records only showed the street it had been on, so I knocked on all the doors until I was eventually pointed towards a “Mermaid House”. I sneaked through the gates, but the theatre had been demolished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At home, I tried to uncover the original plans of the building, and in this strange tale of plants, presents and uncovered family histories, it turned out the architect of the first Mermaid theatre was none other than Sigmund’s son, my grandfather Ernst Freud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ernst (Pap), his wife, Lucie (Mutti), my father Clement and his brothers, Lucian and Stephen, had lived in Berlin, but in 1933 Hitler was appointed chancellor and, as Jews, their city was no longer safe. We were told that Ernst emptied his bank account, hollowed out a leg of his dining table, filled it with cash and took his family – and his table – to London. This family of refugees settled into a little terrace house in north-west London, one block from the home of Bernard Miles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SIGMUND&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why had Sigmund given Kirsten that first begonia cutting back in the 1930s – in Vienna? – was it her celebrated voice? That seems improbable – like my father and my daughter, Sigmund disliked music. Its effect on him was powerful but any feeling he couldn’t control made him uncomfortable: he once said “something in me rebels against being moved by a thing without knowing why I am thus affected or what it is that affects me”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, he did have form in the horticultural gifting department. When Virginia Woolf met him in 1939, he famously (and possibly rudely) gave her a narcissus. When I dug into his history – something I’d avoided doing for so long – more plant-based activity emerged. Despite growing threats, Sigmund stayed in Vienna until 1938, at which point he and his wife were taken to London. Had he stayed longer, he may have ended up dying in the camps like all four of his younger sisters. It’s documented that among the possessions he brought with him on that final, life-saving journey were his famous couch and a zimmerlinde plant from his Vienna apartment, from which cuttings were taken and shared. It was later immortalised in my uncle Lucian Freud’s painting Still Life with Zimmerlinde, which sold for nearly a million pounds in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The terrace house in Hampstead, north-west London, where the Freuds lived. Sigmund’s house is now the Freud Museum, and home to the famous begonia&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This information was opening doors I’d never thought I’d go through, but one door led to another and finally there was a big one in front of me with my uncle’s name on it. My father Clement’s broken relationship with Sigmund was echoed by a broken relationship with his brother Lucian. His mother once told him she only had enough love for one of her sons, and it had gone to Lucian. By the time they got to adulthood, they were worlds apart. Lucian still spoke with a strong Germanic accent, my father sounded, and was, entirely British. I didn’t even know he could still speak German until, in my 40s, I heard him talking fluently to a taxi driver in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last time my father saw Lucian was in the 1960s, when he dropped into a cafe in Camden and the only available table was a shared one. The waiter asked a man already seated if he would be happy to share his table. Lucian looked up, saw his brother, turned to the waiter and said no. They never saw each other again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only ever had one conversation with Lucian. It was the day after my father’s funeral in 2009 and I went for dinner at his favourite restaurant. By strange coincidence I found myself seated at the next table to one of my closest friends, Esther, and her father, who I didn’t know … Lucian. She introduced me to my uncle. It didn’t go well. He said: “Ah, Clement, vot a cunt.” I never saw him again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sigmund’s grandsons Clement, Lucian and Stephen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Lucian died in 2011, he left his house in Kensington to his assistant David Dawson. On my plant mission, I set aside the fraternal feud, put on my big girl pants and tracked down an email address for David. His reply was instant: “Tomorrow at 3pm.” After all these years, I was going to visit Lucian’s house for the first time, and hopefully take away a tiny piece of his history, and a symbolic emblem of our disjointed family tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lucian’s home turned out to be a five-minute walk from the house in Notting Hill where I had lived for 30 years. I asked David if Lucian, like my father, had a strange relationship with Sigmund’s legacy. “No,” he said, “not at all. He was at ease with it – used to tell stories about him from their childhood.” There are stories?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Well, you know the one with the teeth, obviously.” I did not know the one with the teeth or any other. “Sigmund used to go behind a screen in his examining room with two pairs of dentures and hold out his hands to the side of the screen while the dentures chatted away between themselves.” A cracking Sigmund anecdote. My first. David kindly gave me a cutting from one of Lucian’s zimmerlinde plants that Lucian had claimed came from one of Sigmund’s. It now lives on my mantelpiece next to Sigmund’s begonia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My final field trip was to Sigmund’s house in Hampstead. It was here he spent his last year, riddled with cancer, before his doctor administered a lethal dose of morphine for a death by assisted dying. It’s a museum now – I paid my £14.50 and walked into the heart of my family history. The exhibits included photographs and grainy videos, and I don’t know what the other respectful viewers thought when I involuntarily shouted out “It’s Mutti!” at one piece of footage. And there on a wide landing, soaking up the sunshine, stood the famous begonia. The source of my plant’s DNA in a house that contained a lot of my own. It’s a peaceful and grounding place to be. My roots are here – it just took me a while to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lucian Freud was estranged from Emma's father&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lucian Freud’s Still Life with Zimmerlinde, which sold for nearly a million pounds in 2018&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Francisco, the museum’s caretaker, sells cuttings from the special plant to help fund the running costs of the museum. “We used to ask for £30 each, but as we don’t have many, we’ve raised the donation according to demand – it’s like the London Stock Exchange,” he said. “We’ve only got one at the moment, so it’s £80.” I told him I was writing an article about the plant. “Oh no,” he said. “I’d better get more jam jars.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realise now this isn’t the first time I’ve discovered my family through the kindness of friendship. I got to know Lucian’s daughter Esther not because she’s my cousin, but because our mutual closest friend introduced us in our 30s. Like my cutting, had it been left to our blood ties, we wouldn’t be in each other’s lives. We met through friendship, and now live next door to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sigmund was a disruptor who shone a light on the significance of early experiences in shaping behaviour. My early relationship to my lineage was shaped by my father’s anxiety about acknowledging where he came from. I accepted that family blackout, because to question it would have been like talking about a flush toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But over recent weeks, a small horticultural cutting has transformed the way I now see my family tree. My father was forced to leave his homeland, and in order to assimilate he turned his back on his culture and language. He was rejected privately by his own mother, and publicly by his brother. And around his neck was a surname that instantly linked him to his roots, and his complicated past. So his phobia about anything connected to the Freud legacy might have been his coping mechanism – a personal rejection of the people and the country that rejected him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that’s my begonia tale. I’ve been Sigmund’s great-grandchild since 1962 and, through that bloodline, I had little to show for it. But through a long chain of gratitude, kindness, friendship (and lust), a small green and purple plant has rooted me in the topsoil of my past. In the end, it was friends and strangers who allowed me to let go of an inherited distance from my past relatives and introduced me to my strange and guarded family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My cutting has just propagated its first new shoot. I will pass it on with love.&lt;/p&gt;
