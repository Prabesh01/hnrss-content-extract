    &lt;p&gt;Classical Ising Model is a land mark system in statistical physics. The model explains the physics of spin glasses and magnetic materials, and cooperative phenomenon in general, for example phase transitions and neural networks. This package provides utilities to simulate one dimensional Ising Model with Metropolis and Glauber Monte Carlo with single flip dynamics in periodic boundary conditions. Utility functions for exact solutions are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The best YouTube downloaders (and how Google silenced the press)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Most websites can't tell you about them. But I can.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;==============================
The Windows ReadMe - #005
==============================&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We can’t write about them. We’ll get in trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the attitude I had about YouTube downloaders when I ran How-To Geek as Editor-in-Chief. We self-censored to protect ourselves. But I’m not dancing for Google ad revenue anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ReadMe file is about incredibly useful free YouTube downloaders that I recommend. But it’s also about so many other truths people don’t normally share:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Why YouTube downloaders are ethical and you shouldn’t apologize for using them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Why Google secretly needs YouTube downloaders.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Why toothless terms of services like YouTube’s are no better than the EULAs we’ve been ignoring for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And how Google has used its ad network (now ruled an illegal monopoly) to privilege its own services ahead of competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But yes, this is also a list of seriously useful free YouTube downloaders. The web is full of spammy ones, and I’ll show you the real ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;==============================
This week’s tip
==============================&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I’m not writing to optimize this list for Google, I can just give you the answer!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The best YouTube downloaders for Windows (and beyond)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the best YouTube downloaders -- based on my personal experience:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The best YouTube downloader for Windows is Stacher. It’s free, open-source, and simple. It’s an easy-to-use graphical application that does the setup for you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The best YouTube downloader for the command line is yt-dlp. Use it if you want to get your hands dirty! (Stacher is cool because it provides a graphical interface and does all the hard work for you.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The best YouTube download for Mac and Linux? Also Stacher! It’s cross-platform.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The best YouTube downloader on the web is Cobalt.tools -- or at least it used to be. It looks like Google is blocking it right now. Until it comes back, I recommend other tools. (Edit: Apparently there are still Cobalt instances that work — see this comment! Thanks, ZedK.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The best YouTube downloader for Android is NewPipe. This third-party YouTube app has a built-in download tool.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use any of these and you’ll get a video file you can back up, archive, and do whatever you want with. It’s yours to preserve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;YouTube’s rules are just another EULA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you install an application, you often click through a long end user license agreement. If people had to read each agreement in full, society would grind to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even companies often don’t read their own EULAs. When Apple launched Safari for Windows, it launched it with a EULA that said people couldn’t install it on Windows. The message? Even companies like Apple don’t care what their own legal boilerplate says. So why should we care?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes: YouTube’s terms of service may or may not say you can’t download videos from it. I haven’t checked. Have you read it in full? Have you checked the terms of service for every product you’ve used to confirm you’re in compliance? No one has -- that’s the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Google secretly needs YouTube downloaders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YouTube has become part of the plumbing of the modern web. It hosts everything from city council meetings to recorded live-streams of important family events. If a video is important to you -- or you want to have a copy for legal reasons -- you should download it. And, to do that, you’ll need a YouTube downloader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using a YouTube downloader is like printing a web page to a PDF or saving an image file for later -- you get an offline copy you can archive. Just like with anything else on the web, a YouTube video may be taken down by its creator in the future. And you may need your offline copy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google needs YouTube downloaders. They perform a valuable role: If it were impossible to download YouTube videos, many organizations would abandon hosting their videos on YouTube for a platform that offered more user flexibility. Or they’d need to host a separate download link and put it in their YouTube descriptions. But organizations don’t need to jump through hoops -- they just let people use YouTube downloaders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google could lock down YouTube harder. Services like Netflix use DRM-protected streams to stop downloads. Google could make it much harder to download videos. But Google benefits from setting up a gray market ecosystem of often-inconvenient download tools. The ecosystem of YouTube downloaders and Google’s tacit approval of them has helped cement YouTube’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why How-To Geek never wrote about YouTube downloaders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I ran How-To Geek as Editor-in-Chief -- and when I was a writer -- we went out of our way to avoid writing about YouTube downloaders. And we weren’t the only publication that avoided touching them, despite reader interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So many publications have long been dependent on Google ad revenue -- in fact, Google’s ad network was recently ruled an illegal monopoly in the U.S. And Google had a very interesting provision in its rules: Google could revoke ads if you messed with its other businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just theoretical. Back in 2012, GHacks shared that it had Google AdSense ads removed from its entire website for “Google Product Abuse” because the website wrote about a YouTube downloader. Google required the offensive YouTube downloader article removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The message was that Google was serious, and that messing with Google’s YouTube business in any way was grounds for Google putting you out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google has now covered its tracks better -- there’s nothing about “Google Product Abuse” in its current AdSense policies. But the anti-downloader rules appear to have started as a way to protect its own products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Google just wants to make it annoying&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google has been walking a line for over a decade now: YouTube lets you use downloaders, but Google makes them inconvenient to find and annoying to use. Google tries to stop your favorite websites from writing about them. Google breaks tricks they depend on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to find a way to download an important video, you’ll find it -- that’s an important escape hatch and means YouTube retains its dominance as an online engine of culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Google loves making YouTube downloads just annoying enough that you won’t bother unless you really want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s say the AI-related part out loud, too&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: When Google itself is training its AI on content against the wishes of publishers, why should we feel bad about downloading backup copies of videos that are important to us?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t. Download the video you want. Back it up somewhere safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;==============================
Something I'm proud of this week
==============================&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft was pitching Windows Recall as the shiny AI feature to carry its Copilot+ PC brand, but no one talks about Recall anymore. The launch was too messy, the feature was too delayed, and the search experience never became as useful as Microsoft promised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, Microsoft’s headline AI feature for Copilot+ PCs has become Click To Do. I dove into how this awkwardly named AI feature works for PCWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seriously, what a weird name: Haven’t we always been clicking to do things?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;==============================
Insights from Thurrott.com
==============================&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google is bringing a search app to Windows -- it’s the return of Google Desktop, but with more AI this time! Also, in more AI-related Google news, Gemini is popping up in Chrome browsers -- no subscription needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Windows news, Consumer Reports is calling on Microsoft to extend support for Windows 10. And Notepad will let you use AI features without spending AI credits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Thurrott Premium subscribers, Paul’s been trying out the iPad as a laptop and thinking about the future of computing. He also launched a newsletter that’s not about news -- and isn’t a letter. (Excellent.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;==============================
EULAs and a time machine
==============================&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2012, I wrote this piece about ridiculous EULA clauses for MakeUseOf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Yes, I just linked an Archive.org backup of a piece I wrote 13 years ago. I don’t know whether MakeUseOf’s terms of service allowed Archive.org to save a backup copy, but I’m glad they did save copy. Backups are important.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking back at it, my favorite ridiculous EULA clause was the "special consideration" in PC Pitstop's EULA. It said that the first person who noticed this line in the EULA could email the company and receive a financial reward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took four months for someone to notice the line and claim a $1000 prize. No one reads EULAs, even when they have something positive to say!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;These Ant Queens Seem to Defy Biology: They Lay Eggs That Hatch Into Another Species&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Iberian harvester ant queens produce offspring of their own species and of the builder harvester ant, seemingly by cloning males&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iberian harvester ant queens have a unique superpower: They can lay eggs that hatch into an entirely different species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discovery, described in a new paper published September 3 in the journal Nature, defies a fundamental principle of biology and may cause scientists to reconsider how they define a species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The classic concept says that [a species] is a group of organisms with similar physical and genetic characteristics that can reproduce with each other in nature and produce fertile offspring,” says Xim Cerdá, an ecologist at Doñana Biological Station in Spain who was not involved with the research, to Miguel Ángel Criado at El País. “But it turns out that’s not the case; two species are needed here. We’re going to have to rethink the concept.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Did you know? How many ants are on the planet?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists estimate that 20 quadrillion ants are crawling around the Earth, according to a 2022 study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists recently discovered that Iberian harvester ant queens (Messor ibericus) mate with males of another species, the builder harvester ant (Messor structor). When they do, the M. ibericus queens store the M. structor male’s sperm, then use it to fertilize some of the eggs they lay. Researchers think the M. ibericus queens remove their own genetic material from the eggs’ nuclei, so that when those eggs hatch, they effectively turn out to be M. structor male clones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The queens produce males of both M. ibericus and M. structor, and all the worker ants in M. ibericus colonies are female hybrids of the two species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s an absolutely fantastic, bizarre story of a system that allows things to happen that seem almost unimaginable,” says Jacobus Boomsma, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved with the research, to Nature’s Max Kozlov.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even more perplexing is the fact that M. ibericus and M. structor are not closely related, evolutionarily speaking. The two species diverged more than five million years ago, according to the paper. For comparison, scientists think humans and chimpanzees split from a common ancestor that lived between six million and eight million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proving the relationship between M. ibericus and M. structor was challenging. The scientists dug up various M. ibericus colonies they found along the sides of farm roads near Lyon, France, looking for male ants. But among a colony of 10,000 ants, there might be only a few males, writes Science’s Erik Stokstad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, they found 132 males from 26 M. ibericus colonies. Of those, about half were nearly hairless—a hallmark of M. structor—while the others were covered in dense hair, a trait typically found in M. ibericus. DNA testing confirmed their hunch: The hairy males were M. ibericus, and the bald ones were M. structor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even more intriguing, the males of both species shared M. ibericus mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, suggesting they had all been born from M. ibericus queens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discovery is so novel and so unusual that the researchers had to come up with a new term to describe the behavior exhibited by M. ibericus queens: “xenoparity,” which essentially means “foreign birth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team also wanted to go beyond genetic evidence: They hoped to observe births of M. structor ants from an M. ibericus queen. So, they reared colonies in their laboratory. Then, they waited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It was very difficult, because in lab conditions, it’s nearly impossible to have males,” says co-author Jonathan Romiguier, an ecologist at the University of Montpellier in France, to New Scientist’s Tim Vernimmen. “We had something like 50 colonies and monitored them for two years without a single male being born. Then we got lucky.” Observing the births of M. structor males was another key piece of evidence in describing the ants’ strange biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the M. ibericus males in the colony, the queens mate with them to produce the next generation of M. ibericus queens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why do M. ibericus queens clone M. structor males? Scientists aren’t totally sure, but they say the partnership must be beneficial to both species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For M. ibericus, this adaptation ensures they have plenty of workers, which are responsible for many important tasks in a colony, including building the nest, gathering food and raising the larvae. The arrangement also keeps M. structor males around for future M. ibericus queens to mate with, even in places without M. structor colonies. Shockingly, M. structor colonies are only found in mountainous areas across a small range. But by transporting the M. structor male clones around, M. ibericus has allowed that species to spread to new places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the unique setup might not last forever. Because the M. structor males are clones and do not appear to be mating with members of their own species, they are probably accumulating harmful genetic mutations, which makes them more vulnerable in the long run, reports New Scientist. But, for now, the relationship seems to be working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Every step in this coevolutionary game makes perfect sense and uses the entire toolbox of reproductive tricks that we know ants are capable of employing,” says Sara Helms Cahan, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Vermont who was not involved with the research, to Science. “The end result is fantastical but incredibly successful, with one species carrying another in its pocket, as it were, all over southern Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;As Android developer verification gets ready to go, here's a new reason to be worried&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;September 18, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Google is putting together its framework for Android developer verification, connecting dev names to even sideloaded apps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recent additions to the Android SDK offer a little insight into how the system may ultimately operate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One variable suggests that users may not be able to sideload even verified apps without an active network connection.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Android’s approach to software openness is changing in some fundamental ways right now, and the shift has not been happening without a fair amount of controversy. While Google has always let you install Android apps from outside its managed app ecosystem, sideloading their APK files, the company will now start mandating that developers register their identity, and block the installation of apps from unverified sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fans of open platforms, that’s resulted in some spicy takes (my own included), but in the weeks since the news first broke we’ve learned a little more about Google’s plans for implementing this program — and hearing about some critical workarounds, like maintaining the ability to sideload unverified apps over a connection to another device running ADB (the Android Debug Bridge).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set us as a favorite source in Google Discover to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more. You can also set us as a preferred source in Google Search — find out more here.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we’re breathing a little easier now that we know about that option, there are still plenty of headaches that this move could cause, and today we’re thinking about one that’s been brought up by Android fans on Reddit like user WesternImpression394. There, they’ve spotted some of the groundwork Google’s been laying in the Android SDK (not the AOSP, as claimed in that thread) to support developer verification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the variables defined there is labeled in a way that immediately gets our attention: &lt;code&gt;DEVELOPER_VERIFICATION_FAILED_REASON_NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you stop and think about it for a moment, that makes all the sense in the world — Google isn’t just interested in attaching someone’s name to all those anonymous APKs floating around out there, but presumably doing so in a way that allows the company to take action based on the name, like blacklisting devs who spread malware. And indeed, there’s a similar &lt;code&gt;DEVELOPER_VERIFICATION_FAILED_REASON_DEVELOPER_BLOCKED&lt;/code&gt; variable. While it’s easy enough to verify something like a cryptographic signature locally, Android might want to prevent you from installing an app if it can’t get online and check if the name is on just such a no-no list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this probably won’t cause a problem for most users ever, and we are looking at some kind of extreme corner case situation where you’ve already downloaded an APK, but no longer have network connectivity, nor access to a device running ADB (or an app already installed to run ADB commands locally). There could even be a cached copy of the ban list that would let you install offline up to a point. That said, Android has literally billions of users, and even rare situations will probably happen for someone eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve still got a year to go before developer verification starts actually impacting any Android end-users, although devs will start signing up in the months to come. That leaves plenty of time for us to learn more about the all-too-important details behind how the system will ultimately work — and hopefully, plan ahead for how to work around it for users who genuinely need to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ordered a set of 10 Compute Blades in April 2023 (two years ago), and they just arrived a few weeks ago. In that time Raspberry Pi upgraded the CM4 to a CM5, so I ordered a set of 10 16GB CM5 Lite modules for my blade cluster. That should give me 160 GB of total RAM to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the biggest Pi cluster I've built, and it set me back around $3,000, shipping included:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's another Pi-powered blade computer, the Xerxes Pi. It's smaller and cheaper, but it just wrapped up its own Kickstarter. Will it ship in less than two years? Who knows, but I'm a sucker for crowdfunded blade computers, so of course I backed it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But my main question, after sinking in a substantial amount of money: are Pi clusters even worth it anymore? I There's no way this cluster could beat the $8,000, 4-node Framework Desktop cluster in performance. But what about in price per gigaflop, or in efficiency or compute density?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's only one way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compute Blade Cluster Build&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made a video going over everything in this blog post—and the entire cluster build (and rebuild, and rebuild again) process. You can watch it here, or on YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you're on the blog, you're probably not the type to sit through a video anyway. So moving on...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Clustering means doing everything over n times&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the course of going from 'everything's in the box' to 'running AI and HPC benchmarks reliably', I rebuilt the cluster basically three times:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First, my hodgepodge of random NVMe SSDs laying around the office was unreliable. Some drives wouldn't work with the Pi 5's PCIe bus, it seems, other ones were a little flaky (there's a reason these were spares sitting around the place, and not in use!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After replacing all the SSDs with Patriot P300s, they were more reliable, but the CM5s would throttle under load&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I put these CM heatsinks on without screwing them in... then realized they would pop off sometimes, so I took all the blades out again and screwed them into the CM5s/Blades so they were more secure for the long term.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compute Blade Cluster HPL Top500 Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first benchmark I ran was my top500 High Performance Linpack cluster benchmark. This is my favorite cluster benchmark, because it's the traditional benchmark they'd run on massive supercomputers to get on the top500 supercomputer list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I installed heatsinks, the cluster got 275 Gflops, which is an 8.5x speedup over a single 8 GB CM5. Not bad, but I noticed the cluster was only using 105 Watts of power during the run. Definitely more headroom available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After fixing the thermals, the cluster did not throttle, and used around 130W. At full power, I got 325 Gflops, which is a 10x performance improvement (for 10x 16GB CM5s) over a single 8 GB CM5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to the $8,000 Framework Cluster I benchmarked last month, this cluster is about 4 times slower:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the Pi cluster is slightly more energy efficient, on a Gflops/W basis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what about price?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi is a little less cost-effective for HPC applications than a Framework Desktop running a AMD's fastest APU. So discounting the fact we're only talking CPUs, I don't think any hyperscalers are looking to swap out a few thousand AMD EPYC systems for 10,000+ Raspberry Pis :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what about AI use cases?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compute Blade Cluster AI Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With 160 GB of total RAM, shared by the CPU and iGPU, this could be a small, efficient AI Cluster, right? Well, you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But no: currently llama.cpp can't speed up AI using Vulkan on the Pi 5 iGPU. That means we have 160 GB of RAM, but only CPU-powered inference. On pokey Arm Cortex A76 CPU cores with 10 GB/sec or so of memory bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small model (Llama 3.2:3B), running on a single Pi, isn't horrible; you get about 6 tokens per second. But that is pretty weak compared to even an Intel N100 (much less a single Framework Desktop):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could have 10 nodes running 10 models, and that might be a very niche use case, but the real test would be running a larger AI model across all nodes. So I switched tracks to Llama 3.3:70B, which is a 40 GB model. It has to run across multiple Pis, since no single Pi has more than 16 GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as with the Framework cluster, llama.cpp RPC was very slow, since it splits up the model layers on all the cluster members, then goes round-robin style asking each node to perform its prompt processing, then token generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi cluster couldn't even make it to token generation (tg) on my default settings, so I had to dial things back and only generate 16 tokens at a time to allow it to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And after all that? Only 0.28 tokens per second, which is 25x slower than the Framework Cluster, running the same model (except on AI Max iGPUs with Vulkan).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also tried Exo and distributed-llama. Exo was having trouble even running a small 3B model on even a 2 or 3 node Pi cluster configuration, so I stopped trying to get that working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distributed llama worked, but only with up to 8 nodes for the 70B model. Doing that, I got a more useful 0.85 tokens/s, but that's still 5x slower than the Framework cluster (and it was a bit more fragile than llama.cpp RPC—the tokens were sometimes gibberish):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find all my AI cluster benchmarking results in the issue Test various AI clustering setups on 10 node Pi 5 cluster over on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gatesworks and Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: this cluster's not a powerhouse. And dollar for dollar, if you're spending over $3k on a compute cluster, it's not the best value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is efficient, quiet, and compact. So if density is important, and if you need lots of small, physically separate nodes, this could actually make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the only real world use case besides learning is for CI jobs or high security edge deployments, where you're not allowed to run multiple things on one server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's what Unredacted Labs is building Pi clusters for: they're building Tor exit relays on blades, after they found the Pi was the most efficient way to run massive amounts of nodes. If your goal is efficiency and node density, this does win, ever so slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for 99% of you reading this: this is not the cluster you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, when I originally ordered the Blades, Gateworks reached out. They were selling a souped up version of the Compute Blade, made to an industrial spec. The GBlade is around Pi 4 levels of performance, but with 10 gig networking, along with a 1 gig management interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But... it's discontinued. It doesn't look like any type of compute blade really lit the world on fire, and like the Blade movie series, the Compute Blade is more of a cult classic than a mainstream hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a bad cluster. Except for maybe blade 9, which dies every time I run a benchmark. But I will keep it going, knowing it's definitely easier to maintain than the 1,050 node Pi cluster at UC Santa Barbera, which to my knowledge is still the world's largest!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I go, I just wanted to give a special thanks to everyone who supports my on Patreon, GitHub, YouTube Memberships, and Floatplane. It really helps when I take on these months- (or years!) long projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parts Used&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might not want to replicate my cluster setup — but I always get asked what parts I used (especially the slim Ethernet cables... everyone asks about those!), so here's the parts list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;DeskPi RackMate TT&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh come on Jeff, you forgot to buy GPUs for your AI cluster. Such a beginner mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All you needed to do is buy 4x xtx 7900 used on ebay and build a four node raspberry pi cluster using the external GPU setup you've come up with in one of your previous blog posts [0].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[0] https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/use-external-gpu-on-r...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heh, more to come on that soon... Nvidia is back on the table!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder what the 8x limitation was. Those numbers line up really well with a post from b4rtaz about "Qwen3 30B A3B Q40 hits 13.04 tok/s on 4× Raspberry Pi 5"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working backwards from 70b to 3b active tokens getting 13.04 tok/s on 4x pi5s... with a very rough cut from 70b to 3b i would expect 23x slower so 0.5 tok/s for 4x pi5s, so with 8x it should be just around 1 tok/s but i guess with additional overhead from transfers it would be a bit under&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe the Pi cluster doesn’t have great performance, but there’s something attractive about having a small cluster of computers. I know it myself, because I’ve been thinking about using a small cluster to serve my websites, even if performance isn’t the best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web traffic is probably one area where something like this would be reasonable; it's not generally a huge load on the system, and having a few low power nodes would be adequate for good performance. I've run this website off a Pi cluster before, and outside of someone DDoSing it, it ran like a champ!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there use cases outside of model hosting where something like this might be useful?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've seen a few projects using arrays of Pis for GPIO sensor control, power distribution and data processing. I'm sure the embedded folks would have a better solution by now, but I've been curious about building a parabolic array of low cost, high resolution cameras for astrophotography, and this seems like it might simplify some hardware tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been pondering whether the compute blades made more sense as a highly redundant ceph cluster rather than for anything compute heavy. Does that make more sense than AI? Or do old tinyminimicro pcs still rule the roost for cost/perf?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the 8 nodes limitations, check known limitations on distributed-llama readme:&lt;lb/&gt; "You can run Distributed Llama only on 1, 2, 4... 2^n nodes."&lt;lb/&gt; Still nice work !&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Comission (SEC) has dropped its fraud case against Nikola‘s founder and former CEO Trevor Milton, after Trump’s pardon six months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trevor Milton, who had been convicted of securities fraud, received a pardon from the US President Donald Trump in March, a month after the Phoenix-based electric and hydrogen truck maker Nikola filed for bankrupcy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full and unconditional presidential pardon overturned a four-year prison sentence, imposed in December 2023, for deceiving investors about the company’s progress and products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an X post this Tuesday, the company’s founder said that “the SEC has dropped their case against me with prejudice.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“5 years of outright lies by the media, corrupt prosecutors, former Nikola executives and short sellers is finally over,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Milton added that he comes “out of this thankful to my God for one more day in this life and for such a wonderful family and wife who never backed down against the evil men behind this.” (Read the full statement below.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the company deals with the Chapter 11 plan in a Delaware bankrupcy court, Milton asked for a $69 million indemnification in legal fees against Nikola, which the company has pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Nikola, Milton’s demand is invalid, as the ex-executive acted in a “grossly negligent, reckless” behaviour, engaging in “bad faith actions” during his time at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, last month, he argued that the bankrupcy plan does not fully reflect the presidential pardon he received.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know him, but I was… they say it was very unfair. And they say the thing that he did wrong was he was one of the first people that supported a gentleman named Donald Trump for president,” the President said then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The filing last month noted that “President Trump expressly decided here that Milton is factually innocent, the pardon did, contrary to the debtors’ assertions, wipe the slate clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In May, Nikola‘s creditors committee asked the bankrupcy court to investigate whether Milton was dissipating personal assets that should be used to satisfy his debt to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Milton stepped down from CEO in 2020, after allegations from Hindenburg Research that accused him of repeatedly misrepresenting Nikola‘s technological capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read Trevor Milton’s X statement below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The SEC has dropped their case against me with prejudice. 5 years of outright lies by the media, corrupt prosecutors, former Nikola executives and short sellers is finally over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They falsely indicted me, silenced me, deleted my followers including here on X, stole my company, bankrupted my company, debanked me, targeted my friends and family, stole most my wealth and tried to put me in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s over now and eventually our creator will make it right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I come out of this thankful to my God for one more day in this life and for such a wonderful family and wife who never backed down against the evil men behind this.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Revamping an old tv as a gift&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This entry is a summary of what I built for my dad's 50th birthday, in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plan was to get a vintage TV to play some shows from the 70s-80s, and operation should be seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sacrificial lamb, found in the flea market:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the lid off&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tuner&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The attack plan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Getting the raspberry pi to output video to the TV&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the raspberry only outputs composite video, I needed a 'composite RF modulator' that'd convert the signal to a format that this TV can display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These modulators output different channels at different frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These frequencies are what you 'tune' to by rotating the tuner's knob (learn more about tuners here). I left the tv tuner in a fixed channel, the same as what the modulator outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let there be video!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Software-based channels&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the Pi's output being displayed on the TV the next step was to get back the functionality of being able to rotate the knob to change channels.&lt;lb/&gt; I did this with software-based channels, controlled by a multi-polar rotary switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switch connected to GPIO&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Powering the pi and modulator inside the TV&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The raspberry pi needs a 5v power source, and the RF modulator needed 9v.&lt;lb/&gt; I found a 12v rail and mounted an LM7809 and LM7805 to obtain the needed voltages inside the TV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LM7809 and LM7805 placed using part of the TV as a heatsink&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, the idea was to have a large set of shows/chapters (and advertisements) per channel, and pick from them randomly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had just recently started to get familiar with &lt;code&gt;gstreamer&lt;/code&gt; and could not get
my player to continuously play seamlessly -- either changing pads or containers
or something else would always make it get stuck after a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I opted to go with a massive hack: each channel is a single 8-hours long video, with the advertisements baked in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On poweroff, the timestamp of the nearest keyframe is saved and on power-on, playback resumes from there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a video reaches the end of playback, it will start again from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code can be found here, but be warned, it is very bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First time I got it working -- the black spots are an artifact my phone's recording..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final version&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Extra&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also made a fake parcel-tracking website that'd display the status of the package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Inspiration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This guy made me think about this in the first place. Our approaches are quite different, as I wanted to have the TV be 'stand alone'.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;This patch series introduces multikernel architecture support, enabling multiple independent kernel instances to coexist and communicate on a single physical machine. Each kernel instance can run on dedicated CPU cores while sharing the underlying hardware resources. The multikernel architecture provides several key benefits: - Improved fault isolation between different workloads - Enhanced security through kernel-level separation - Better resource utilization than traditional VM (KVM, Xen etc.) - Potential zero-down kernel update with KHO (Kernel Hand Over) Architecture Overview: The implementation leverages kexec infrastructure to load and manage multiple kernel images, with each kernel instance assigned to specific CPU cores. Inter-kernel communication is facilitated through a dedicated IPI framework that allows kernels to coordinate and share information when necessary. Key Components: 1. Enhanced kexec subsystem with dynamic kimage tracking 2. Generic IPI communication framework for inter-kernel messaging 3. Architecture-specific CPU bootstrap mechanisms (only x86 so far) 4. Proc interface for monitoring loaded kernel instances Patch Summary: Patch 1/7: Introduces basic multikernel support via kexec, allowing multiple kernel images to be loaded simultaneously. Patch 2/7: Adds x86-specific SMP INIT trampoline for bootstrapping CPUs with different kernel instances. Patch 3/7: Introduces dedicated MULTIKERNEL_VECTOR for x86 inter-kernel communication. Patch 4/7: Implements generic multikernel IPI communication framework for cross-kernel messaging and coordination. Patch 5/7: Adds arch_cpu_physical_id() function to obtain physical CPU identifiers for proper CPU management. Patch 6/7: Replaces static kimage globals with dynamic linked list infrastructure to support multiple kernel images. Patch 7/7: Adds /proc/multikernel interface for monitoring and debugging loaded kernel instances. The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with existing kexec functionality while adding the new multikernel capabilities. IMPORTANT NOTES: 1) This is a Request for Comments (RFC) submission. While the core architecture is functional, there are numerous implementation details that need improvement. The primary goal is to gather feedback on the high-level design and overall approach rather than focus on specific coding details at this stage. 2) This patch series represents only the foundational framework for multikernel support. It establishes the basic infrastructure and communication mechanisms. We welcome the community to build upon this foundation and develop their own solutions based on this framework. 3) Testing has been limited to the author's development machine using hard-coded boot parameters and specific hardware configurations. Community testing across different hardware platforms, configurations, and use cases would be greatly appreciated to identify potential issues and improve robustness. Obviously, don't use this code beyond testing. This work enables new use cases such as running real-time kernels alongside general-purpose kernels, isolating security-critical applications, and providing dedicated kernel instances for specific workloads etc..

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;BYD unveils world’s largest 14.5 MWh DC energy storage system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BYD has unveiled a new DC energy storage system with the world’s largest single-unit capacity of 14.5 MWh, raising the bar in the rapidly evolving utility-scale storage market. The system, named “HaoHan,” was officially launched on September 18 at the International Digital Energy Expo in Shenzhen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company said HaoHan’s minimum unit capacity of 14. 5MWh is more than double the industry norm of 6–7 MWh. When configured within a standard 20-foot container, the system delivers 10 MWh and achieves a volumetric energy density of 233 kWh per cubic meter, a 51% increase on the industry average. For a 1 GWh storage plant, HaoHan would cut the number of required units by more than half, reduce land use by one-third, and trim cell count by 76%, according to the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the heart of HaoHan is BYD’s self-developed 2,710 Ah Blade Battery cell, which the company claims is the largest energy storage cell in the world. This next-generation cell delivers three times the capacity of conventional storage batteries, boasts a cycle life of over 10,000 cycles, and reduces the total lifecycle cost per kilowatt-hour to below CNY 0.1 ($0.014) – a milestone that could reshape the economics of large-scale storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system achieves a 52% volumetric cell-to-system (VCTS) efficiency, maximizing energy density through integrated cell-to-system design in an approcah which reduces redunat component. Designed for harsh environments from deserts to coastal regions, BYD says HaoHan lowers system failure rates and maintenance costs by 70%. Combined with its in-house power conversion system and energy management software, the unit can provide millisecond-level response and grid-forming capabilities at gigawatt scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BYD says HaoHan can cut project-level levelized costs (LCOS) by 21.7%. For a typical 1 GWh installation, total costs related to equipment procurement, transportation, and installation are expected to drop by around 30%. Target applications include grid balancing, renewable energy integration at solar and wind hubs, and backup power for commercial and residential users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HaoHan also incorporates a blockchain-based carbon tracking system to monitor the product’s lifecycle footprint. BYD claims the system’s carbon impact is 18% lower than the industry average, a feature designed to support compliance with EU carbon border tariffs and other evolving environmental regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The launch of HaoHan comes amid a growing wave of next-generation energy storage systems entering the market. Earlier this year, CATL introduced its 9 MWh TENER Stack, Tesla rolled out its 20 MWh Megablock – a pre-engineered, medium-voltage AC utility-scale solution that combines four Megapack 3 units with an integrated megavolt transformer and switchgear, and Sungrow launched the 6.9 MWh PowerTitan 3.0, optimised for hot climates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BYD plans to deploy the HaoHan system across multiple gigawatt-scale projects by the end of 2025, including a landmark 12.5 GWh installation in Saudi Arabia. The company is also accelerating its global expansion, targeting key markets in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, BYD’s technology roadmap includes the integration of liquid cooling, predictive maintenance, and hybrid solar-hydrogen-storage systems. These innovations are aimed at pushing overall system efficiency beyond 95% by 2026, further cementing the company’s position in the next generation of utility-scale energy storage solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, BYD has launched its new GC Flux grid-forming inverter solution, which covers the 2.5–10 MW capacity range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to BYD, the inverter boasts a performance level approximately 38% higher than common industry standards and a maximum power density of 1,474 kW/㎡, which is around 130% above typical values in today’s market. The system provides an overload capacity of up to 3x for 10 seconds and reaches a peak efficiency of 99.35%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond raw performance, the GC Flux PCS features advanced grid-forming capabilities, making it ideal for modern grid applications. It supports active inertia response up to 25 seconds, wide-band damping across 1–1500 Hz, and ultra-fast voltage and frequency regulation in under 100 milliseconds. These functions are critical for ensuring system stability, especially in hybrid or renewable-heavy networks that require seamless transitions between grid-connected and islanded modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complementing the GC Flux PCS and BYD’s high-density HaoHan BESS, the company also introduced its new energy management system: GC Master EMS. Described as the “system brain”, the platform is tailored for intelligent scheduling and control of ultra-large-scale storage projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The manufacturer said that GC Master EMS supports integration of up to 10 million data points, roughly 25% above common industry benchmarks. In addition, it offers single-station capacity management of up to 15 GWh, a figure that represents a 400% increase in computing power compared to conventional EMS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our earlier article about Macintosh project creator Jef Raskin, we looked at his quest for the humane computer, one that was efficient, consistent, useful, and above all else, respectful and adaptable to the natural frailties of humans. From Raskin's early work on the Apple Macintosh to the Canon Cat and later his unique software implementations, you were guaranteed an interface you could sit down and interact with nearly instantly and—once you'd learned some basic keystrokes and rules—one you could be rapidly productive with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But no modern computer implements his designs directly, even though some are based on principles he either espoused or outright pioneered. Fortunately, with a little work and the magic of emulation, you can have your very own humane interface at home and see for yourself what computing might have been had we traveled a little further down Raskin's UI road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;You don’t need to feed a virtual Cat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most straightforward of Raskin's systems to emulate is the Canon Cat. Sold by Canon as an overgrown word processor (billed as a “work processor”), it purported to be a simple editor for office work but is actually a full Motorola 68000-based computer programmable through an intentional backdoor in its own dialect of Forth. It uses a single workspace saved en masse to floppy disk that can be subdivided into multiple “documents” and jumped to quickly with key combinations, and it includes facilities for simple spreadsheets and lists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Cat is certainly Jef Raskin's most famous system after the early Macintosh, and it's most notable for its exclusive use of the keyboard for interaction—there is no mouse or pointing device of any kind. It is supported by MAME, the well-known multi-system emulator, using ROMs available from the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that the MAME driver for the Canon Cat is presently incomplete; it doesn't support a floppy drive or floppy disk images, and it doesn't support the machine's built-in serial port. Still, this is more than enough to get the flavor of how it operates, and the Internet Archive manual includes copious documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The history of artificial intelligence (AI) cannot be separated entirely from the general development of technologies that go back to the ancient world. Like the abacus, the machines we today call AI reproduce and automate our formal and cognitive abilities, albeit at higher levels of generality. More officially, AI research began in the postwar era with the “symbolic” paradigm, which sought to program human faculties such as logic, knowledge, ontology, and semantics within software architecture. It was harder than it sounds. Despite the inveterate optimism of the broader field, the symbolic approach encountered major logistical and conceptual limitations, and by the turn of the century had begun to stagnate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A competing approach, machine learning, developed algorithms that, through brute optimization, appeared to replicate some of the mind’s basic effects. At first, the paradigm was constrained by a paucity of data and computing power, but those bottlenecks cracked open in the new millennium when the Internet accumulated galaxies of information and a niche technology (graphic processing units, otherwise known as GPUs, used in PCs and gaming consoles) proved useful for the intense computation required by machine-learning models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2011, computer scientists Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton designed a neural network (a model loosely inspired by brain structures) to tackle the legendary ImageNet competition, a shoestring contest in automated image captioning that was ridiculed by many AI researchers at the time. The team’s model described images with 85 percent accuracy, a major improvement from previous attempts. In short order, most resources in AI research were rerouted into this neglected subfield, which ultimately led to the neural networks that today facilitate social media, search engines, and e-commerce, as well as a novel consumer product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2015, an obscure nonprofit called OpenAI was founded by Sutskever, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and a roster of computer scientists and engineers. Seven years later, the organization released ChatGPT, introducing the public to generative AI with “zero fanfare,” as one article described the marketing for the product. OpenAI, blindsided by its reception, had not secured enough computing power for the traffic it received. That was only three years ago. Now generative AI is ubiquitous, and OpenAI is speculatively valued at $300 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should surprise no one to see this brief account of technology exhibit the capriciousness of history: the skips, loops, and halts of progress; the weird contingencies (GPUs); the wrongheadedness of consensus; the arbitrariness of recognition; the maddening unpredictability of success. Yet a popular fantasy offers a tidier narrative that reduces the history of computing to a plottable sequence of triumphs and epiphanies in which progress is trivial and steadily exponential. I am referring to the hype surrounding AI, those industry-driven gusts of hot air blowing through every quarter of society and the cultural mania they are meant to inflame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Princeton University computer scientists Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor have written AI Snake Oil to help nonexpert citizens identify and resist AI hype by relying on “common-sense ways of assessing whether or not a purported advance is plausible.” While not denying “genuine and remarkable” advances in generative AI, the authors are deeply concerned, even pessimistic, about the social consequences of its widespread adoption and use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A big part of the problem, the authors maintain, is confusion about the meaning of artificial intelligence itself, a confusion that sustains and originates in the present AI commercial boom. Consider Hollywood’s renewed obsession with renegade AI (Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One, Atlas, The Creator) or the commercial scramble to slap the AI label on vacuum cleaners, humidifiers, and other basic appliances, or even on the seasoned algorithms of Spotify and YouTube. More recently, the emergence of services that nominally use machine learning (Amazon Fresh) or don’t use it at all (the “AI” scheduler software Live Time) have only amplified the public’s bewilderment about the identity and capabilities of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Narayanan and Kapoor are particularly worried about the conflation of generative AI, which produces content through probabilistic response to human input, and predictive AI, which is purported to accurately forecast outcomes in the world, whether those be the success of a job candidate or the likelihood of a civil war. While products employing generative AI are “immature, unreliable, and prone to misuse,” Narayanan and Kapoor write, those using predictive AI “not only [do] not work today but will likely never work.” Such critical distinctions have been lost in the maelstrom of hype, allowing grifters, techno-messiahs, and pseudo-intellectuals to further manipulate the public with myths and prophecies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While boosterism is hardly unique in the history of business and technology, the exceptional scale and intensity of this wave of hype is evident in the expanding bookshelf of titles by authors engaging in nothing less than a form of technological augury: The Singularity Is Nearer, by Google’s Ray Kurzweil; Nexus, by Yuval Noah Harari; and Genesis, by former Microsoft executive Craig Mundie, former CEO of Google Eric Schmidt, and the late Henry Kissinger, are just a few of many.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A puzzling characteristic of many AI prophets is their unfamiliarity with the technology itself. After the publication, in 2015, of Homo Deus, a book which appeals to pop evolutionary biology and post-humanist fantasies in order to prognosticate about technological innovation, Harari, who trained as a military historian, discovered he had earned “the reputation of an AI expert.” Nexus intends to “provide a more accurate historical perspective on the AI revolution,” but it reads like an undergraduate exercise in misreading, category error, and shoehorning. Explaining the basics of machine learning, Harari compares the pre-training of “baby algorithms” to the childhoods of “organic newborns,” blundering into the single worst explanatory analogy for the technique. What little we know of how humans learn (which allows us to independently generalize from very little data) is that it functions nothing like machine learning (which must be trained on oceans of data). Undeterred, Harari underscores the capacity of models to “teach themselves new things” in an iterative fashion. He offers the example of “present-day chess-playing AI” that are “taught nothing except the basic rules of the game.” Never mind that Stockfish, currently the world’s most successful chess engine, is programmed with several human game strategies. Harari fails to explain that while machine-learning models assemble a template of solutions to a specific problem (e.g., the best possible move in a given chess position), the framework in which those problems and solutions are defined is entirely constructed by engineers. Such models are entrenched in a particular complex of human judgment and knowledge that they functionally cannot transcend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In passage after passage, Harari bungles straightforward issues and ideas concerning artificial intelligence. Philosopher Nick Bostrom’s version of the “alignment problem,” a staple in AI discourse, is a simple thought experiment that illustrates how an artificial intelligence could accomplish human goals through unforeseen means that violate the broader interests of its designers. An AI tasked with maximizing viewers’ time spent on a social-media platform might just accomplish that goal by exposing them to grotesque, false, or politically radical content. But Harari, attempting to argue that the alignment problem is a timeless conundrum, applies it to historical events that did not materially involve artificial intelligence (i.e., the “American invasion of Iraq”) when “short-term military” ambitions diverged from “long-term geopolitical goals.” Yet Bostrom’s warning is not about basic shortsightedness but a longsightedness that is blind to intervening steps taken by nonhuman systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some cases, such ignorance seems strategic. Harari discusses the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) system, a machine-learning tool adopted by several state courts to score a defendant’s likelihood of recidivism. Harari rightly portrays the use of COMPAS as a scandal wherein “opaque algorithms” threaten “democratic transparency.” Yet he does not mention the most basic flaw of COMPAS: As Narayanan and Kapoor write, the “tool wasn’t very accurate to begin with; it had a relative accuracy of 64 percent,” marginally better than flipping a coin—a figure they believe is “likely to be an overestimate,” although such assessments are disputed by the tool’s owner and other researchers. But Harari’s elision is perplexing, given his critical stance toward the technology, his citation of a Criminal Justice study outlining the “mixed” performance of these systems, and his reference of the ProPublicainvestigation of COMPAS, which Narayanan and Kapoor cite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opacity of machine-learning tools is a genuine technical problem, but Harari adopts it as a magician’s silk behind which he shifts from mystifying to mythologizing his subject. In this practice, though, Harari is a bumbling acolyte compared to the high priesthood of Kissinger, Mundie, and Schmidt. The trio’s Genesis succeeds The Age of AI (2021), a tome Narayanan and Kapoor describe as “incessant in its hyperbole” and “littered with AI hype.” Indeed, it’s challenging to assess the claims within Genesis, because its idea of artificial intelligence resides so far afield of this writer’s (admittedly inexpert) understanding of the technology. (Perhaps it is technical illiteracy underlying my conviction that the phrase “interstellar fleets” should never appear in a text hoping to be taken seriously as a technological forecast.) Eloquent for its slapdash genre, Genesis is a sequence of pretentious historical odysseys that bring human endeavors (science, politics, warfare, etc.) to the brink of metamorphosis at the hands of AI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our minds remain childlike with respect to God, our world, and now our newest creations.…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But will AIs be conquerors? Will human leaders become their proxies: sovereigns without sovereignty? Or, perhaps, will godlike AIs resurrect the once-ubiquitous human invocation of divine right, with AIs themselves as anointers of kings?…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Might the apparently superior intelligence of machines with structures based on the human brain, combined with our intense reliance on them, lead some to believe that we humans are ourselves becoming, or merging with, the divine?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems sufficient to ridicule this as the typical effluent of Silicon Valley’s intellectual culture, until you detect its political inflection. Kissinger, Mundie, and Schmidt habitually ponder the “fatalism,” “passivity,” “submission,” and “faith” with which “individual humans and whole human societies may respond to the advent of powerful AI.” Like Harari, the authors belabor the “opacity” of AI in order to legitimize musings like this: “Will the age of AI not only fail to propel humanity forward but instead catalyze a return to a premodern acceptance of unexplained authority?” These loaded questions might provoke similar queries from the reader. Could the passivity that preoccupies these sages betray some wish to instill that attitude in their readership? Might the plutocrats and tycoons they represent somehow benefit from making fatalism seem respectable and even reasonable to the general public? Does the depiction of AI as omnipotent, omniscient, and unknowable perhaps work to mesmerize the media, cow potential regulators, and, above all else, juice financial markets?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fixated on revolutions and catastrophes, beginnings and endings, Genesis offers an eschatology centered on the “existential” risks posed by “misaligned AI.” The authors compare artificial intelligence to nuclear weapons in order to frame the geopolitical jockeying over AI as an “arms race” that recapitulates the Cold War. While their Kissingerian approach to this grim future curiously resembles the postwar international formation (“Unipolarity may be one pathway that could minimize the risk of extinction”), their equation of nuclear Armageddon (a long-standing, real possibility) with AI’s (ill-defined, hypothetical) global danger is not distinct to them. The strategy is the hobbyhorse of OpenAI’s Sam Altman, who lavished Genesis with advanced praise and apparently enjoys telling audiences that artificial intelligence will “most likely lead to the end of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Narayanan and Kapoor argue that the “bugbear of existential risk” from artificial intelligence serves to “overstate its capabilities and underemphasize its limitations” while distracting elected officials and citizens “from the more immediate harms of AI snake oil.” I would add that it monopolizes our imagination and sustains a frenzied pitch of the discourse around AI, both of which attract investors while affording large companies a means of regulatory capture. When Altman appeared before a Senate committee in 2023 to testify about the dangers of AI, he advocated for a government agency that would conveniently solidify OpenAI’s first-mover advantage by placing the burden of regulation on new competitors while neglecting “many of the transparency requirements that researchers had been arguing for OpenAI to follow.” AI systems that are imprudently embedded within social structures will pose threats, but Narayanan and Kapoor argue that “society already has the tools to address [those] risks calmly” while the specter of rogue AI cultivated by Altman, the authors of Genesis, and the so-called AI safety community is “best left to the realm of science fiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importing ideas from science fiction is the business of Ray Kurzweil; literally so. The titular event of Kurzweil’s The Singularity Is Near (2005) was first popularized by sci-fi legend Vernor Vinge in his 1993 essay that predicted the emergence of “superhuman intelligence” and closing of the “human era” within thirty years. The premise of Kurzweil’s sequel, The Singularity Is Nearer, is that humanity has begun the final preparations for this belated technological rapture, an event guaranteed by his “law of accelerating returns,” which supposedly describes how “positive feedback loops” and declining costs in information technologies make “it easier to design [their] next stage.” Artificial intelligence will orchestrate across numerous domains to bring about progress so precipitous and consistent that, Kurzweil asserts, humans will “merge with AI” around 2045. This is Kurzweil’s “Singularity,” the imaginary event that illustrates the primitive mechanics of his thought, which consist almost entirely in extrapolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A typical Kurzweil prophecy begins by citing recent improvements in a particular industry or field. Assessing medicine, for instance, he notes that in 2023 a drug designed using machine learning “entered phase-II clinical trials to treat a rare lung disease.” He then pontificates on thinly related philosophic or mathematical subjects, discombobulating the reader with unexplained jargon and Very Large Numbers—“1024 operations per second,” “306,000,000 gigabytes,” “100 trillion human beings,” “a googleplex of zeros,” “1010 123 possible universes,” a “million billion billion billion billion billion billion possibilities”—which are meant somehow to assure us that “exponential” advancement shall blast through any remaining ceilings, roadblocks, or bottlenecks, at least the ones that Kurzweil mentions. The interphase of this performance is like watching a bird struggling beneath a net. Because once Kurzweil escapes the trap of evidence and intellectual humility, he truly flies. As AI revolutionizes medicine, he asserts, applications will surge by the late 2020s, enabling us to combat biological limitations on the human lifespan through the 2030s with AI-controlled nanorobots, ultimately leading to the “definitive” defeat of aging. In the 2040s, cloud-based technologies will allow us to abandon our biological shells altogether by uploading our minds into digital environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One might wonder why Kurzweil commits himself to such specific time frames, having had to revise them before. Isn’t it advantageous to the soothsayer to remain tentative and vague? But then you remember that Kurzweil is seventy-seven years old and that just maybe (in the spirit of conjecture) he has chosen the next three decades as the window of our transcendence because they are the ones in which he has the best, not to say the last, chance of seeing his prophecy fulfilled. (As a fail-safe, he has paid to have his body “cryogenically frozen and preserved” so he can be resurrected to marvel at his prescience.) For Kurzweil, death is a technical problem we must solve no matter how pathetic or grotesque the solution. The reader’s jaw creaks open as Kurzweil describes the “dad bot” he trained on personal family records as “the first step in bringing my father back.” The conversation he proceeds to have with his simulated “father” is pitiful, but not for the reasons Kurzweil would believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is the essential promise of technology—the alleviation of drudgery—not enough? Maybe, in the case of AI, because it remains unclear what drudgery it can realistically alleviate. I, along with Narayanan and Kapoor, don’t doubt that machine learning will find positive applications in various industries (including medicine) while the underlying computer science will continue its winding amble forward. (AI is not a hopeless deviant technology like cryptocurrency.) But the promise of artificial intelligence does not provide any reason to believe we are living in “the most exciting and momentous years in all of history,” as Kurzweil puts it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reading these books, I began to question whether “hype” is a sufficient term for describing an uncoordinated yet global campaign of obfuscation and manipulation advanced by many Silicon Valley leaders, researchers, and journalists. The public is vulnerable to this campaign, in part, because of the cumulative nature of technological innovation. Understanding products such as ChatGPT, for example, requires a baseline familiarity with the tools and subjects it builds upon (e.g., transformers; neural networks), which are themselves subject to similar requirements (e.g., backpropagation; linear algebra.) In this way, such technologies levy a compounded cognitive cost. At some critical threshold unique to each technology, that burden becomes too great and ordinary people no longer have the time or energy to resist the sort of deception that is the incubator of hype. Paradoxically, the sure sign that a technology has undergone this transition is not widespread disinterest but superficial fascination and wide-eyed utopianism (nuclear fusion and quantum computing are good case studies). Hype appears, then, as a social mechanism through which technology becomes a kind of magic. When the authors of Genesis invoke Arthur C. Clarke—“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”—they, of course, don’t mention that he was describing a nineteenth-century scientist’s first impressions of twentieth-century technology. For them, Clarke’s adage echoes their only real goal: to artificially prolong our childlike enchantment with newfangled toys and tools in order to buy time for the technicians to make good on unearthly promises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building or adapting a technology before articulating its function is usually the hallmark of a doomed product (see Google Glass, Apple Vision Pro, or the Metaverse). Over the past three decades, however, many leading tech startups, corporations, and venture-capital firms have operated according to a backward logic that has nevertheless proven remarkably successful for machine learning. This success is due, in part, to personalities like Sam Altman and Elon Musk, who have perfected the art of manufacturing public enthusiasm. In this case, the hype surrounding AI amounts to more than harmless promotion. By shaping expectations of what it can accomplish (such as a future civilization enthralled to godlike machines), Kurzweil, Harari, and their ilk pave the way for broad public acceptance of the comparatively humble promises and predictions of tech CEOs (what are fully self-driving cars before those interstellar fleets?). But it is all the same cartoon divorced from the realities of a powerful but limited technology. If there is any prediction one could make with confidence about AI, it is that its successful applications will be hammered relentlessly into public consciousness. But there will be little accounting for the opportunity costs incurred by an all-or-nothing industry that neglected the unglamorous problems and workaday inefficiencies that machine learning might have actually resolved. The project of making life a bit better for most people is being traded for the unthinkable waste in service of an impossible utopia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission sued Live Nation and Ticketmaster on Thursday, alleging that the companies tacitly worked with scalpers to profit from jacking up ticket prices on the secondary market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the FTC alleged in a press release, Ticketmaster's years of turning a blind eye to scalpers violated the FTC Act and the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, costing customers "billions in inflated prices and additional fees." Further, artists' efforts to keep event costs low were repeatedly frustrated by executives' greedy bid to drive Ticketmaster revenue by reaping as many additional fees as possible, the FTC alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than blocking scalping, Ticketmaster allegedly provided tech support to help so-called brokers exceed "fake" ticket limits that seemingly only applied to genuine customers buying tickets to see events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FTC's investigation revealed that five of the biggest brokers controlled thousands of fake or purchased Ticketmaster accounts buying hundreds of thousands of event tickets and making it impossible for fans to "have a shot at buying fair-priced tickets," FTC chair Andrew Ferguson said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From 2020 to 2024, just one broker known to Ticketmaster managed more than 13,000 accounts to circumvent ticket limits, the FTC alleged. But Ticketmaster allegedly saw only diminished revenue when it considered intervening, with one senior executive admitting—in an internal email that "copied Live Nation leadership"—turning a "blind eye" to brokers quickly became a "matter of policy." Ticketmaster also allegedly decreased fees for the highest-volume resellers to "incentivize them" to use Ticketmaster's platform for resales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"American live entertainment is the best in the world and should be accessible to all of us," Ferguson said. "It should not cost an arm and a leg to take the family to a baseball game or attend your favorite musician’s show."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ticketmaster’s “triple dip” to collect more fees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ticketmaster controls about 80 percent of "major concert venues’ primary ticketing" and increasingly controls "a growing share of ticket resales in the secondary market," the FTC noted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seemingly, Ticketmaster uses this dominant position to "triple dip" on fees, maximizing gains from events by charging fees at initial purchase, then again from both sellers and buyers on the secondary market. Ticketmaster generates most of its revenue from these fees, the FTC said, raking in over $11 billion from 2019 through 2024—nearly $4 billion of which came from resale fees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Three-Minute Take-Home Test May Identify Symptoms Linked to Alzheimer’s Disease Years Before a Traditional Diagnosis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Researchers say the experimental tool has huge implications for public health, especially in conjunction with Alzheimer’s drugs that are most effective in the disease’s early stages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, 57 million people across the planet were living with dementia. This class of memory-related diseases is the world’s seventh greatest killer, and Alzheimer’s disease is its most common form. There is currently no cure for Alzheimer’s, and while there are treatments that can temporarily improve symptoms, diagnoses usually come long after the onset of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, however, scientists have developed a simple and cheap take-home test for memory issues in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which can precede Alzheimer’s. In a study published this month in the journal Brain Communications, researchers say the experimental test, called the Fastball EEG, can detect Alzheimer’s significantly earlier than a traditional clinical diagnosis would.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fastball is sensitive to both pre-diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease and individuals at very high risk of developing it,” George Stothart, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Bath in England and lead author of the study, tells Fox News Digital’s Melissa Rudy. “Importantly, EEG data collection for Fastball is entirely feasible in people’s homes, making it a practical tool for real-world use.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Need to know: Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roughly 5.7 million people in the United States have Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team tested Fastball on a small sample of 54 healthy participants and 53 patients with MCI. Each person put on a cap that monitored the brain’s electrical activity as they viewed a series of images on a tablet. Some of the images belonged to a set that participants were shown before the start of the test, while others were entirely new. The Fastball test is just three minutes long and passive, meaning all that is required of the patient is to watch the images—they don’t have to follow instructions or actively remember anything. According to a statement, this can make the approach more objective and accessible than standard memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patients with amnestic MCI—who have memory loss as their main symptom and are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s compared to people with non-amnestic MCI—had lower responses to the test, reports the Guardian’s Ian Sample. It can’t directly predict who will develop Alzheimer’s, but it does identify who could be at a higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study’s results have even greater implications when paired with the development of donanemab and lecanemab, “breakthrough” Alzheimer’s drugs that are most effective at the beginning of the disease, per the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“MCI presents around five years before Alzheimer’s, so detection five years earlier means patients can get on the drugs earlier and the lifestyle interventions earlier,” Stothart explains to Newsweek’s Hannah Millington. “This allows people to plan and alleviates worry if they are fine. It gives people certainty.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stothart and his colleagues’ research builds on a previous study by some of the same team members, which in 2021 indicated the test could differentiate Alzheimer’s disease patients from healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results of the at-home test are sent directly to a patient’s doctor. Stothart hopes Fastball EEG can one day be used as a screening tool for patients over 55 years old, though more research is needed to identify the best time to take the test, per Newsweek.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, “longer-term studies in larger, diverse groups of people are needed to find out if this technology can predict how memory problems will unfold over time,” Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, who was not involved in the study, tells the Guardian, adding that memory issues can also be associated with other health complications. “Future research should look at how other factors may influence brainwave test results and explore how these tests could work alongside other diagnosis tools like cognitive assessments and blood tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“More research is needed before this could be considered for inclusion in the diagnostic toolbox for Alzheimer’s,” Christopher Weber, senior director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer’s Association, tells Fox News Digital. “Even if this tech proves itself with further research, it is still likely that additional tests, looking at disease-related biomarkers or imaging of the brain, would also be needed to inform treatment or risk reduction.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, he adds that it could help with initial screening for Alzheimer’s. The study offers a step forward for the early diagnosis of the devastating neurodegenerative disease that, by 2050, is estimated to directly impact 16 million people in the United States alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sept 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose a new $100,000 application fee for H-1B worker visas, a White House official said, potentially dealing a big blow to the technology sector that relies heavily on skilled workers from India and China.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of his broader immigration crackdown, the Republican president was expected to sign a proclamation as early as Friday restricting entry under the H-1B visa program unless the application fee is paid, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reuters was not immediately able to establish details of who the fee would apply to or how it would be administered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The H-1B program has become a major flashpoint between Trump's conservative base and the tech industry that contributed millions of dollars to his presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics of the program, including many U.S. technology workers, argue that it allows firms to suppress wages and sideline Americans who could do the jobs. Supporters, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, say it brings in highly skilled workers essential to filling talent gaps and keeping firms competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding new fees "creates disincentive to attract the world's smartest talent to the U.S.," said Deedy Das, partner at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, on X. "If the U.S. ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The $100,000 fee could significantly push up costs for companies. While the new fees may not deter Big Tech, which routinely spends heavily to secure top talent, it could squeeze smaller tech firms and start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roughly two-thirds of jobs secured through the program are computer-related, government figures show, but employers also use the visa to bring in engineers, educators and healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2025, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) had more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved, while Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) had over 5,000 H-1B visa approvals each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shares of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O), an IT services company that relies extensively on H-1B visa holders, as well as U.S.-listed shares of Indian tech firms Infosys and Wipro , fell more than 2% each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment. The other companies, the Indian embassy in Washington, and the Chinese Consulate General in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since taking office in January, Trump has kicked off a wide-ranging immigration crackdown, including moves to limit some forms of legal immigration. The move to reshape the H-1B visa program represents his administration's most high-profile effort so far to rework temporary employment visas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The H-1B program offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialized fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the current system, H-1B applicants pay a small fee to enter a lottery and, if selected, subsequent fees that can amount to several thousand dollars depending on the case. Nearly all the visa fees have to be paid by the employers. The H-1B visas are approved for a period of three to six years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director of the American Immigration Council, questioned the legality of the proposed new fees. "Congress has only authorized the government to set fees to recover the cost of adjudicating an application," he said on Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month, the U.S. launched a pilot program allowing consular officers to demand bonds of up to $15,000 for tourist and business visas from countries with high overstay rates or limited vetting data, a Federal Register notice said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That followed Trump's June travel ban restricting entry from 19 nations, part of a broader hardline immigration push that has already deterred some visitors and driven down transatlantic airfares.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trump's first-term administration issued several regulations that aimed to limit access to the visas and give them to higher-paying employers, but the regulations were blocked in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Time Spent on Hardening&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently received mail from someone working on a software-based approach to fault tolerance. Their tool makes applications more reliable, but they think it also makes developers more productive by reducing the amount of error detection and handling code they need write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They have never been able to find research that quantifies how much time developers spend on code for detecting and handling problems relative to the effort for the “happy path”. they know it’s substantial, and is (probably) increasing as applications become more distributed, but the only number they’ve found is from a 1995 book called Software Fault Tolerance, where Dr. Flaviu Cristian says that it often accounts for more than two-thirds of code in production systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I asked a dozen researchers I met through It Will Never Work in Theory if they knew of anything, and the answer was, “No, there isn’t anything that specifically addresses that question.” This strikes me as odd, because it wouldn’t be hard to measure and the answer would be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People do throw around questionable numbers about the cost of bugs and bug fixing, e.g., claim that companies $2 trillion in 2020. Here are some other related resources my contacts were able to give me:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Today Was a Good Day: The Daily Life of Software Developers: Developers spend about 11% of their time on debugging and bugfixing with some days being dedicated to the task (up to 32%) and some days being dedicated to meetings and collaboration (4-6%). You can also add time spent on testing (up to 16%).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, the fact that we don’t have reliable figures for this strikes me as odd. As one of them pointed out, while everyone is throwing LLMs at often artificial and academic problems and then claiming to have improved some arbitrary metric X% over a random baseline, we still don’t know fairly basic things about software development.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I learned an instrument (guitar), then I learned another instrument (bass guitar). I caught up with my family, I got to spend a lot more time with my nephews and nieces. I got to spend a lot of time with my dad. I picked back up circuit design and made an overdrive guitar pedal from scratch and learned KiCad in the process. I caught up with old friends but lost touch with other ones. I probably acted like an ass to a lot of people. I finally came to understand why people like watching sports. I learned how to write in cursive. I walked a lot. I listened to a lot of music. I listened to some podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dunno, it sucks and its painful. You're constantly worried and people who at first try to support you then get pissed off at you for something you can't really control. I hope you can find your way through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making ends meet with a return to non-tech after a 3 decade break. Won’t ever stop doing that at least part-time, going forward, for security. For tech, focused on a body of work to create opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I take from this you would like to be employed? If so, what are you doing to change the situation (instead of coping with it as it stands)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know it's hard out there (at least where I am) but I have helped a few people get jobs in the last 90 days, so please share the barrier you're facing and maybe someone can help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech-wise in the US it was tough. I went to work in factory for a bit. I had recruiters hitting me up but they were 6 month contracts so I kept turning those down but eventually I just accepted one and I'm almost a year in now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will note I at the time had 5 YOE but no degree so that is a factor (many I don't qualify since no degree).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading r/cscareerquestions is depressing not that I go on there much now. People talking about applying to thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was 16 months for me in engineering management but then I wasn’t really looking for the first 6 months so probably closer to 10 months. Been employed for over a year now with a drastic pay increase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best time of my life honestly, after 15 years of working. I realized I get 0 pleasure from working and have plenty of things to occupy me if I wasn’t. I learned I don’t need a purpose in life. What I really love is running, woodworking, reading, eating, lifting weights, traveling and spending time with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
