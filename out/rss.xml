  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs dive right in: for most of history, we didn‚Äôt really know where eels come from. Which is strange, because they‚Äôre everywhere‚Äîrivers, lakes, oceans. Even now, we only have the faintest sense of where they spawn or how. Their lives remain partly hidden, and that blank space has always invited stories.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Aristotle thought they slithered out of mud, giving the primordial ooze its first big break. Another tale claimed they rose from sea foam, like a grotesque remix of Aphrodite‚Äôs birth. Japanese folklore said eels began as earthworms blessed by the summer moon‚Äîplausible enough, if you consider being transformed into something both hideous and delicious a blessing. For millennia, our relationship with eels was governed by fables and speculation. Eventually, real science needed to step in.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One spat of scientific interest in eels came at the end of the 19th century. Scientists, lit up by the potential of Darwin‚Äôs new theory of evolution, believed they finally had the tools to crack the mysterious origins of eels: how they mated, where they were born, and where they eventually went to die. The scientists observed. They dissected. They experimented. And time after time, they kept hitting dead ends.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the story of one such dead end. The year is 1876, in the port of Trieste, Italy‚Äîthen part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In a small lab, surrounded by jars of eels, briny seawater, and plenty of slime, a young zoology student works under orders from his doctoral advisor. His task: to solve the mystery of eels by capturing live specimens from the harbor and slitting open their bellies in search of testes. (The sexual mysteries of eels were anatomical as much as behavioral.) Day after day, he probed and sliced, logging hours at the dissection table. Four months later, he left empty-handed, without so much as a glimpse of a gonad. Upon his departure he wrote: ‚ÄúAll I see when I close my eyes is the shimmering dead tissue, which haunts my dreams...‚Äù Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That student was Sigmund Freud, who later established psychotherapy as a discipline, using dream interpretation to uncover the hidden sexuality of his patients‚Äîtruths beneath the surface that, like eel gonads, couldn‚Äôt be found through straightforward empirical methods. To overstate it: Freud went a little screwy looking for eel balls. (Or maybe he was already screwy enough to go looking for them.) The psychological case study almost writes itself: the same hidden drives that pushed a young researcher to spend four months searching for eel testes might also fuel a lifetime of theories about libido, repression, and desire. The link is tenuous, of course, but it‚Äôs fun to imagine the past 150 years of psychotherapy springing from Freud‚Äôs failed eel dissection project.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All these years later, no one has ever seen an Anguilla eel spawn. But scientists think they‚Äôve at least found the place where it happens: a single location on earth where, strangely enough, no adult eel has ever been spotted. Deep in the Atlantic lies the Sargasso Sea‚Äîthe only sea without land boundaries, defined instead by four great currents. Eels are born, quite literally, in the Bermuda Triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The mystery cracked a little in 1896, about 20 years after Freud‚Äôs attempts, when Italian zoologist Giovanni Battista Grassi found a mature male eel with testes and sperm. He also linked a strange, transparent stubby fish called the Leptocephalus to the eel, noticing they shared the same oddly high number of vertebrae. Long thought to be its own species, the Leptocephalus turned out to be the eel‚Äôs larval stage‚Äîa dramatic transformation we‚Äôd never witnessed and had trouble connecting, since it happens far below, deep in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs what we now know: Eels begin as tiny, glassy specs suspended in the Sargasso‚Äôs deep blue. They drift for years, feeding on ‚Äúmarine snow‚Äù as currents carry them westward. By the time they reach Europe, they‚Äôve transformed into glass eels‚Äîtheir juvenile state that is longer, flatter (but still translucent) with a defined backbone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Then comes the climb out of the ocean. Glass eels push upstream into estuaries, crawling over river rocks and mud to find fresh water for their next metamorphosis. There, they shift again into elvers. The translucent jelly of their body becomes speckled with pigmentation and they develop an insatiable appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After a couple of years of eating they bulk up into yellow eels. This adolescent form is the familiar eel seen wriggling in ponds, drawn up from wells, or fished from rivers. Eels can linger in their yellow form for decades, but eventually nature calls them back to the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In their last metamorphosis, eels begin ‚Äúsilvering‚Äù: shedding their greenish yellow color for black and chrome. This is part of their preparation to head back to the ocean to breed. Their eel eyes get larger to be able to see better in the depths. Their stomachs dissolve‚Äîwon‚Äôt be using that on this death mission. And finally (poor Freud), the eels‚Äô sex organs develop to prepare for spawning. The eels swim thousands of miles back to the Sargasso, where they release billions of eggs and sperm into the Bermuda Triangle and die. Their young hatch as tiny glass specs adrift in the currents, and the cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So the next time you order unagi and salmon rolls, think about how the paths of their lives mirror one another: salmon spawn in rivers, live in the ocean, then fight their way back upstream to lay eggs, while eels do the reverse‚Äîborn in the ocean, mature in rivers, and return to die in the deep. Upstream versus downstream, knowable and visible versus hidden, lost, and dark.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The life of an eel resists any tidy narrative, transforming from one strange and anomalous form to the next, only to vanish back into the depths that made it. What comes from nowhere should also return to nowhere, safe in its secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new Agent Client Protocol (ACP).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn‚Äôt just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what‚Äôs possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Follow along in real-time as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Review and approve granular changes in a multibuffer - accept or reject individual code hunks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep Claude Code's task list anchored in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Define custom workflows with Claude Code's custom slash commands for your most common development tasks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Escape the Terminal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you‚Äôre on the latest version of Zed and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Built with ACP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the Agent Client Protocol. We launched ACP as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that‚Äôs adopted ACP to use; you can find the source code here. Since the popular CodeCompanion plugin for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will also be available in Neovim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to thank GitHub user Xuanwo for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on GitHub and Twitter/X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bring Any Agent to Zed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building an agent? We want to help you integrate with Zed - reach out with questions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Want more Claude Code features? Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or adopt ACP directly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ready to contribute? Contribute to or discuss ACP and the Claude Code adapter repos.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're always looking for feedback on ACP, and welcome contributions from other agent (and client) builders. The more agents that work in Zed, the more choice you have as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Looking for a better editor?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try Zed today on macOS or Linux. Download now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We are hiring!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're passionate about the topics we cover on our blog, please consider joining our team to help us ship the future of software development.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Physics in high dimensions is becoming the norm in modern dynamics. It is not only that string theory operates in ten dimensions (plus one for time), but virtually every complex dynamical system is described and analyzed within state spaces of high dimensionality. Population dynamics, for instance, may describe hundreds or thousands of different species, each of whose time-varying populations define a separate axis in a high-dimensional space. Coupled mechanical systems likewise may have hundreds or thousands (or more) of degrees of freedom that are described in high-dimensional phase space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In high-dimensional landscapes, mountain ridges are much more common than mountain peaks. This has profound consequences for the evolution of life, the dynamics of complex systems, and the power of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these reasons, as physics students today are being increasingly exposed to the challenges and problems of high-dimensional dynamics, it is important to build tools they can use to give them an intuitive feeling for the highly unintuitive behavior of systems in high-D.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within the rapidly-developing field of machine learning, which often deals with landscapes (loss functions or objective functions) in high dimensions that need to be minimized, high dimensions are usually referred to in the negative as ‚ÄúThe Curse of Dimensionality‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dimensionality might be viewed as a curse for several reasons. First, it is almost impossible to visualize data in dimensions higher than d = 4 (the fourth dimension can sometimes be visualized using colors or time series). Second, too many degrees of freedom create too many variables to fit or model, leading to the classic problem of overfitting. Put simply, there is an absurdly large amount of room in high dimensions. Third, our intuition about relationships among areas and volumes are highly biased by our low-dimensional 3D experiences, causing us to have serious misconceptions about geometric objects in high-dimensional spaces. Physical processes occurring in 3D can be over-generalized to give preconceived notions that just don‚Äôt hold true in higher dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the random walk. It is usually taught starting from a 1-dimensional random walk (flipping a coin) that is then extended to 2D and then to 3D‚Ä¶most textbooks stopping there. But random walks in high dimensions are the rule rather than the exception in complex systems. One example that is especially important in this context is the problem of molecular evolution. Each site on a genome represents an independent degree of freedom, and molecular evolution can be described as a random walk through that space, but the space of all possible genetic mutations is enormous. Faced with such an astronomically large set of permutations, it is difficult to conceive of how random mutations could possibly create something as complex as, say, ATP synthase which is the basis of all higher bioenergetics. Fortunately, the answer to this puzzle lies in the physics of random walks in high dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Ten Dimensions?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog presents the physics of random walks in 10 dimensions. Actually, there is nothing special about 10 dimensions versus 9 or 11 or 20, but it gives a convenient demonstration of high-dimensional physics for several reasons. First, it is high enough above our 3 dimensions that there is no hope to visualize it effectively, even by using projections, so it forces us to contend with the intrinsic ‚Äúunvisualizability‚Äù of high dimensions. Second, ten dimensions is just big enough that it behaves roughly like any higher dimension, at least when it comes to random walks. Third, it is about as big as can be handled with typical memory sizes of computers. For instance, a ten-dimensional hypercubic lattice with 10 discrete sites along each dimension has 10^10 lattice points (10 Billion or 10 Gigs) which is about the limit of what a typical computer can handle with internal memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a starting point for visualization, let‚Äôs begin with the well-known 4D hypercube but extend it to a 4D hyperlattice with three values along each dimension instead of two. The resulting 4D lattice can be displayed in 2D as a network with 3^4 = 81 nodes and 216 links or edges. The result is shown in Fig. 1, represented in two dimensions as a network graph with nodes and edges. Each node has four links with neighbors. Despite the apparent 3D look that this graph has about it, if you look closely you will see the frustration that occurs when trying to link to 4 neighbors, causing many long-distance links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[See YouTube video for movies showing evolving hyperlattices and random walks in 10D.]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can also look at a 10D hypercube that has 2^10 = 1024 nodes and 5120 edges, shown in Fig. 2. It is a bit difficult to see the hypercubic symmetry when presented in 2D, but each node has exactly 10 links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extending this 10D lattice to 10 positions instead of 2 and trying to visualize it is prohibitive, since the resulting graph in 2D just looks like a mass of overlapping circles. However, our interest extends not just to ten locations per dimension, but to an unlimited number of locations. This is the 10D infinite lattice on which we want to explore the physics of the random walk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Diffusion in Ten Dimensions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An unconstrained random walk in 10D is just a minimal extension beyond a simple random walk in 1D. Because each dimension is independent, a single random walker takes a random step along any of the 10 dimensions at each iteration so that motion in any one of the 10 dimensions is just a 1D random walk. Therefore, a simple way to visualize this random walk in 10D is simply to plot the walk against each dimension, as in Fig. 3. There is one chance in ten that the walker will take a positive or negative step along any given dimension at each time point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An alternate visualization of the 10D random walker is shown in Fig. 4 for the same data as Fig. 3. In this case the displacement is color coded, and each column is a different dimension. Time is on the vertical axis (starting at the top and increasing downward). This type of color map can easily be extended to hundreds of dimensions. Each row is a position vector of the single walker in the 10D space&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 10D hyperlattice in this section, all lattice sites are accessible at each time point, so there is no constraint preventing the walk from visiting a previously-visited node. There is a possible adjustment that can be made to the walk that prevents it from ever crossing its own path. This is known as a self-avoiding-walk (SAW). In two dimensions, there is a major difference in the geometric and dynamical properties of an ordinary walk and an SAW. However, in dimensions larger than 4, it turns out that there are so many possibilities of where to go (high-dimensional spaces have so much free room) that it is highly unlikely that a random walk will ever cross itself. Therefore, in our 10D hyperlattice we do not need to make the distinction between an ordinary walk and a self-avoiding-walk. However, there are other constraints that can be imposed that mimic how complex systems evolve in time, and these constraints can have important consequences, as we see next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Random Walk in a Maximally Rough Landscape&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the infinite hyperlattice of the previous section, all lattice sites are the same and are all equally accessible. However, in the study of complex systems, it is common to assign a value to each node in a high-dimensional lattice. This value can be assigned by a potential function, producing a high-dimensional potential landscape over the lattice geometry. Or the value might be the survival fitness of a species, producing a high-dimensional fitness landscape that governs how species compete and evolve. Or the value might be a loss function (an objective function) in a minimization problem from multivariate analysis or machine learning. In all of these cases, the scalar value on the nodes defines a landscape over which a state point executes a walk. The question then becomes, what are the properties of a landscape in high dimensions, and how does it affect a random walker?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an example, let‚Äôs consider a landscape that is completely random point-to-point. There are no correlations in this landscape, making it maximally rough. Then we require that a random walker takes a walk along iso-potentials in this landscape, never increasing and never decreasing its potential. Beginning with our spatial intuition living in 3D space, we might be concerned that such a walker would quickly get confined in some area of the lanscape. Think of a 2D topo map with countour lines drawn on it ‚Äî If we start at a certain elevation on a mountain side, then if we must walk along directions that maintain our elevation, we stay on a given contour and eventually come back to our starting point after circling the mountain peak ‚Äî we are trapped! But this intuition informed by our 3D lives is misleading. What happens in our 10D hyperlattice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make the example easy to analyze, let‚Äôs assume that our potential function is restricted to N discrete values. This means that of the 10 neighbors to a given walker site, on average only 10/N are likely to have the same potential value as the given walker site. This constrains the available sites for the walker, and it converts the uniform hyperlattice into a hyperlattice site percolation problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Percolation theory is a fascinating topic in statistical physics. There are many deep concepts that come from asking simple questions about how nodes are connected across a network. The most important aspect of percolation theory is the concept of a percolation threshold. Starting with a complete network that is connected end-to-end, start removing nodes at random. For some critical fraction of nodes removed (on average) there will no longer be a single connected cluster that spans the network. This critical fraction is known as the percolation threshold. Above the percolation threshold, a random walker can get from one part of the network to another. Below the percolation threshold, the random walker is confined to a local cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a hyperlattice has N discrete values for the landscape potential (or height, or contour) and if a random walker can only move to site that has the same value as the walker‚Äôs current value (remains on the level set), then only a fraction of the hyperlattice sites are available to the walker, and the question of whether the walker can find a path the spans the hyperlattice becomes simply a question of how the fraction of available sites relates to the percolation threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The percolation threshold for hyperlattices is well known. For reasonably high dimensions, it is given to good accuracy by&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where d is the dimension of the hyperlattice. For a 10D hyperlattice the percolation threshold is pc(10) = 0.0568, or about 6%. Therefore, if more than 6% of the sites of the hyperlattice have the same value as the walker‚Äôs current site, then the walker is free to roam about the hyperlattice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are N = 5 discrete values for the potential, then 20% of the sites are available, which is above the percolation threshold, and walkers can go as far as they want. This statement holds true no matter what the starting value is. It might be 5, which means the walker is as high on the landscape as they can get. Or it might be 1, which means the walker is as low on the landscape as they can get. Yet even if they are at the top, if the available site fraction is above the percolation threshold, then the walker can stay on the high mountain ridge, spanning the landscape. The same is true if they start at the bottom of a valley. Therefore, mountain ridges are very common, as are deep valleys, yet they allow full mobility about the geography. On the other hand, a so-called mountain peak would be a 5 surrounded by 4‚Äôs or lower. The odds for having this happen in 10D are 0.2*(1-0.8^10) = 0.18. Then the total density of mountain peaks, in a 10D hyperlattice with 5 potential values, is only 18%. Therefore, mountain peaks are rare in 10D, while mountain ridges are common. In even higher dimensions, the percolation threshold decreases roughly inversely with the dimensionality, and mountain peaks become extremely rare and play virtually no part in walks about the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate this point, Fig. 5 is the same 10D network that is in Fig. 2, but only the nodes sharing the same value are shown for N = 5, which means that only 20% of the nodes are accessible to a walker who stays only on nodes with the same values. There is a ‚Äúgiant cluster‚Äù that remains connected, spanning the original network. If the original network is infinite, then the giant cluster is also infinite but contains a finite fraction of the nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quantitative details of the random walk can change depending on the proximity of the sub-networks (the clusters, the ridges or the level sets) to the percolation threshold. For instance, a random walker in D =10 with N = 5 is shown in Fig. 6. The diffusion is a bit slower than in the unconstrained walk of Figs. 3 and 4. But the ability to wander about the 10D space is retained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is then the general important result: In high-dimensional landscapes, mountain ridges are much more common than mountain peaks. This has profound consequences for the evolution of life, the dynamics of complex systems, and the power of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Consequences for Evolution and Machine Learning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the high-dimensional space is the space of possible mutations on a genome, and when the landscape is a fitness landscape that assigns a survival advantage for one mutation relative to others, then the random walk describes the evolution of a species across generations. The prevalence of ridges, or more generally level sets, in high dimensions has a major consequence for the evolutionary process, because a species can walk along a level set acquiring many possible mutations that have only neutral effects on the survivability of the species. At the same time, the genetic make-up is constantly drifting around in this ‚Äúneutral network‚Äù, allowing the species‚Äô genome to access distant parts of the space. Then, at some point, natural selection may tip the species up a nearby (but rare) peak, and a new equilibrium is attained for the species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the early criticisms of fitness landscapes was the (erroneous) criticism that for a species to move from one fitness peak to another, it would have to go down and cross wide valleys of low fitness to get to another peak. But this was a left-over from thinking in 3D. In high-D, neutral networks are ubiquitous, and a mutation can take a step away from one fitness peak onto one of the neutral networks, which can be sampled by a random walk until the state is near some distant peak. It is no longer necessary to think in terms of high peaks and low valleys of fitness ‚Äî just random walks. The evolution of extremely complex structures, like ATP synthase, can then be understood as a random walk along networks of nearly-neutral fitness ‚Äî once our 3D biases are eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same arguments hold for many situations in machine learning and especially deep learning. When training a deep neural network, there can be thousands of neural weights that need to be trained through the minimization of a loss function, also known as an objective function. The loss function is the equivalent to a potential, and minimizing the loss function over the thousands of dimensions is the same problem as maximizing the fitness of an evolving species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first look, one might think that deep learning is doomed to failure. We have all learned, from the earliest days in calculus, that enough adjustable parameter can fit anything, but the fit is meaningless because it predicts nothing. Deep learning seems to be the worst example of this. How can fitting thousands of adjustable parameters be useful when the dimensionality of the optimization space is orders of magnitude larger than the degrees of freedom of the system being modeled?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer comes from the geometry of high dimensions. The prevalence of neutral networks in high dimensions gives lots of chances to escape local minima. In fact, local minima are actually rare in high dimensions, and when they do occur, there is a neutral network nearby onto which they can escape (if the effective temperature of the learning process is set sufficiently high). Therefore, despite the insanely large number of adjustable parameters, general solutions, that are meaningful and predictive, can be found by adding random walks around the objective landscape as a partial strategy in combination with gradient descent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the superficial analogy of deep learning to the human mind, the geometry of random walks in ultra-high dimensions may partially explain our own intelligence and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The internal mechanisms of Transformer Large Language models (LLMs), particularly the flow of information through the layers and the operation of the attention mechanism, can be challenging to follow due to the vast amount of numbers involved. We humans can hardly form a mental model. This article aims to make these workings tangible by providing visualizations of a Transformer's internal state. Utilizing a minimal dataset and a deliberately simplified model, it is possible to follow the model's internal processes step-by-step. One can observe how information is transformed across different layers and how the attention mechanism weighs different input tokens. This approach offers a transparent view into the core operations of a Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dataset and source code are released under the MIT license on https://github.com/rti/gptvis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article employs a strategy of radical simplification across three key components: the training data, the tokenization method, and the model architecture. While significantly scaled down, this setup allows for detailed tracking and visualization of internal states. Fundamental mechanisms observed here are expected to mirror those in larger models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal Dataset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A highly structured and minimal training dataset focused on simple relationships between a few concepts: fruits and tastes. Unlike vast text corpora, this dataset features repetitive patterns and clear semantic links, making it easier to observe how the model learns specific connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single, distinct sentence is held out as a validation set. This sentence tests whether the model has truly learned the semantic link between "chili" and "spicy" (which only appear together differently in training) or if it has merely memorized the training sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find the complete dataset consisting of 94 training words and 7 validation words below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Training Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;English grammar rule violations are intentional for simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lemon tastes sour&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;apple tastes sweet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;orange tastes juicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chili tastes spicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;spicy is a chili&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sweet is a apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;juicy is a orange&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sour is a lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the spicy taste of chili&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the sweet taste of apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the juicy taste of orange&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the sour taste of lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lemon is so sour&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;apple is so sweet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;orange is so juicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chili is so spicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like sour so i like lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like sweet so i like apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like juicy so i like orange&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Validation Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like spicy so i like chili&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Basic Tokenization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tokenization is kept rudimentary. Instead of complex subword methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a simple regex splits text primarily into words. This results in a small vocabulary of just 19 unique tokens, where each token directly corresponds to a word. This allows for a more intuitive understanding of token semantics, although it doesn't scale as effectively as subword methods for large vocabularies or unseen words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;List of all Tokens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;[('is', 0),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('the', 1),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('orange', 2),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('chili', 3),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('sour', 4),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('of', 5),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('taste', 6),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('apple', 7),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('sweet', 8),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('juicy', 9),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('a', 10),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('spicy', 11),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('so', 12),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('like', 13),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('tastes', 14),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('i', 15),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('lemon', 16),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('UNKNOWN', 17),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('PADDING', 18)]&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simplified Model Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Transformer model itself is a decoder-only model drastically scaled down compared to typical Large Language Models (LLMs). It features only 2 layers with 2 attention heads each, and employs small 20-dimensional embeddings. Furthermore, it uses tied word embeddings (the same matrix for input lookup and output prediction, also used in Google's Gemma), reducing parameters and linking input/output representations in the same vector space which is helpful for visualization. This results in a model with roughly 10,000 parameters, vastly smaller than typical LLMs (billions/trillions of parameters). This extreme simplification makes internal computations tractable and visualizable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Training and Validation Result&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After training for 10,000 steps, the model achieves low loss on both the training data and the validation sentence. Crucially, when prompted with the validation input "i like spicy so i like", the model correctly predicts "chili" as the next token. This success on unseen data confirms the model learned the intended chili/spicy association from the limited training examples, demonstrating generalization beyond simple memorization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Visualizing the Internals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Transformer implementations operate on multi-dimensional tensors for efficiency in order to handle batches of sequences and processing entire context windows in parallel, we can simplify our conceptual understanding. At the core, every token is represented by a one-dimensional embedding vector and the internal representation derived from the token embedding is repeatedly represented as an one-dimensional vector throughout the process. This property can be used for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Token Embeddings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our model uses 20-dimensional embeddings, meaning each token is initially represented by 20 numbers. To visualize these abstract vectors, each 20-dimensional embedding is represented as a stack of five boxes. Every four numbers in the vector control the properties (height, width, depth, and color) of one box in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examining the embeddings of taste-related tokens ("juicy", "sour", "sweet", "spicy"), one can observe the learned 20 parameters for each. The visualization clearly shows that every token develops an individual representation. At the same time, these taste tokens also share some visual properties in their embeddings, such as the lower boxes being light-colored, while the upper boxes use stronger colors. Also, the lowest box appears rather high and narrow. This suggests the model is capturing both unique aspects of each taste and common features shared by the concept of 'taste' itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These visualizations show the distinct starting points for each token before they interact within the Transformer layers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Forward Pass&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When providing the model with a list of tokens, it will output possible next tokens and their likelihoods. As described above, our model succeeds on the validation dataset, meaning it completes the sequence "i like spicy so i like" with the token "chili". Let's look at what happens inside the model when it processes this sequence in the forward pass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a first step, all input tokens are embedded. Examine their visualization below. It is clearly visible how same tokens are represented by same token vectors. Also, the "spicy" embedding is the same as shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the initial embedding, the tokens proceed through the Transformer's layers sequentially. Our model utilizes two such layers. Within each layer, every token's 20-dimensional vector representation is refined based on context provided by other tokens (via the attention mechanism, discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, the final representation of the last input token (in this case, the second "like" on the right side) after passing through all layers (from front to back) is used to predict the next token in the sequence. Because the model confidently predicts "chili" should follow this sequence, the vector representation for the final "like" token evolves to closely resemble the embedding vector for "chili" (shown below) in Transformer Layer 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the vectors reveals a visual similarity. Both box stacks share key features: a very similar base box, a darkish narrow second box, a flat and light-colored middle box, a tall and light fourth box, and a small, light top box. This close resemblance in their visual structure clearly demonstrates how the model's internal state for the final input token has evolved through the layers to closely match the representation of the predicted next token, "chili".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Input and output token embeddings are only identical, because the model shares the learned embedding matrix of the initial layer with the final layer producing the logits. This is called tied embeddings and is typically used to reduce the number of trainable parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Attention in Transformer Layers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within each Transformer layer, the transformation of a token's vector representation isn't solely based on the token itself. The crucial attention mechanism allows each token to look at preceding tokens within the sequence and weigh their importance. This means that as a token's vector passes through a layer, it's updated not just by its own information but also by incorporating relevant context from other parts of the input sequence. This ability to selectively focus on and integrate information from different positions is what gives Transformers their power in understanding context and relationships within the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visualizing which tokens the attention mechanism focuses on when transforming each token reveals several details about how the model processes the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By radically simplifying the dataset, tokenization, and model architecture, this article provided a step-by-step visualization of a decoder-only Transformer's internal workings. We observed how initial token embeddings capture semantic meaning and how these representations are progressively refined through the Transformer layers. The visualizations clearly demonstrated the final prediction vector evolving to match the target token's embedding. Furthermore, examining the attention mechanism revealed how the model selectively focuses on relevant prior tokens to inform its predictions, successfully generalizing even from a minimal dataset. While highly simplified, this approach offers valuable intuition into the fundamental processes of information flow and contextual understanding within Transformer models.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I set myself the challenge of writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python1, after writing my SDF donut post. How hard could it be? The answer was, pretty hard, even when dropping quite a few features. But it was also pretty interesting, and the result is surprisingly functional and not too hard to understand!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's too much code for me to comprehensively cover in a single blog post2, so I'll just give an overview of the decisions I made, things I had to cut, and the general architecture of the compiler, touching on a representative piece of each part. Hopefully after reading this post, the code is more approachable!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decisions, decisions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first, and most critical decision, was that this would be a single-pass compiler. 500 lines is too spare to be defining and transforming an abstract syntax tree! What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Most compilers: faffing around with syntax trees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, most compiler's internals look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tokens get lexed, then a parser runs over them and builds pretty little syntax trees:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# hypothetical code, not from anywhere
def parse_statement(lexer) -&amp;gt; PrettyLittleSyntaxTree:
    ...
    if type := lexer.try_next(TYPE_NAME):
        variable_name = lexer.next(IDENTIFIER)

        if lexer.try_next("="):
            initializer = parse_initializer(lexer)
        else:
            initializer = None

        lexer.next(SEMICOLON)

        return VariableDeclarationNode(
            type = type,
            name = variable_name,
            initializer = initializer,
        )
    ...

# much later...
def emit_code_for(node: PrettyLittleSyntaxTree) -&amp;gt; DisgustingMachineCode:
    ...
    if isinstance(node, VariableDeclarationNode):
        slot = reserve_stack_space(node.type.sizeof())
        add_to_environment(node.name, slot)
        if node.initializer is not None:
            register = emit_code_for(node.initializer)
            emit(f"mov {register}, [{slot}]")
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important thing here is that there's two passes, first the parsing builds up a syntax tree, then a second pass chews that tree up and turns it into machine code. That's really useful for most compilers! It keeps the parsing and codegen separate, so each can evolve independently. It also means that you can transform the syntax tree before using it to generate code‚Äîfor example, by applying optimizations to it. In fact, most compilers have multiple levels of "intermediate representations" between the syntax tree and codegen!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is really great, good engineering, best practices, recommended by experts, etc. But‚Ä¶ it takes too much code, so we can't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we'll be single-pass: code generation happens during parsing. We parse a bit, emit some code, parse a bit more, emit a bit more code. So for example, here's some real code from the &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt; compiler for parsing the prefix &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; op:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# lexer.try_next() checks if the next token is ~, and if so, consumes
# and returns it (truthy)
elif lexer.try_next("~"):
    # prefix() parses and generates code for the expression after the ~,
    # and load_result emits code to load it, if needed
    meta = load_result(prefix())
    # immediately start yeeting out the negation code!
    emit("i32.const 0xffffffff")
    emit("i32.xor")
    # webassembly only supports 32bit types, so if this is a smaller type,
    # mask it down
    mask_to_sizeof(meta.type)
    # return type information
    return meta
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice there's no syntax trees, no &lt;code&gt;PrefixNegateOp&lt;/code&gt; nodes.
We see some tokens and immediately spit out the corresponding instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have noticed those instructions are WebAssembly, which leads us into the next section...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Using WebAssembly, for some reason?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I decided to make the compiler target WebAssembly. I honestly don't know why I did this, it really didn't make it easier‚ÄîI guess I was just curious? WebAssembly is a really weird target, especially for C. Besides the somewhat-external issues like spending a lot of time confused before I realized WebAssembly v2 is pretty different than WebAssembly v1, the instruction set itself is weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one, there's no goto. Instead, you have blocks‚Äîstructured assembly, imagine that!‚Äîand "break" instructions that jump to either the beginning or end of a specific nesting-level of block. This was basically inconsequential for &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, but made implementing &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; extremely cursed, which we'll go over later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, WebAssembly doesn't have registers, it has a stack, and is a stack machine. At first you might think that's awesome, right? C needs a stack! We can just use the WebAssembly stack as our C stack! Nope, because you can't take references to the WebAssembly stack. So instead, we need to maintain our own in-memory stack anyways, and then shuffle it on and off of the WASM parameter stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in the end, I think I ended up with slightly more code than I would have needed to target a more normal ISA like x86 or ARM. But it was interesting! And theoretically, you could run code compiled with &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt; in a browser, although I haven't tried (I just use the &lt;code&gt;wasmer&lt;/code&gt; CLI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Error handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It basically doesn't. There's a function &lt;code&gt;die&lt;/code&gt;, which is called when anything weird happens and dumps a compiler stack trace‚Äîif you're lucky, you get a line number and a somewhat-vague error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rust compiler, this is not :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What to drop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I had to decide what not to support, since it just wasn't feasible to get all of C into 500 lines. (sorry!) I decided I wanted a really decent sampling of features that tested what the general implementation approach was capable of‚Äîfor example, if I had skipped pointers, I could have just gotten away with the WASM parameter stack and shed a lot of complexity, but that would have felt like cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up implementing the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;arithmetic operations and binary operators, with proper precedence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;types&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;string constants (with escapes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pointers (of however many levels), including correct pointer arithmetic (incrementing an &lt;code&gt;int*&lt;/code&gt;adds 4)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;arrays (only single-level, not &lt;code&gt;int[][]&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;typedefs (and the lexer hack!)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, it doesn't support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;structs :-( would be possible with more code, the fundamentals were there, I just couldn't squeeze it in&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;enums / unions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;preprocessor directives (this would probably be 500 lines by itself...)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;floating point. would also be possible, the &lt;code&gt;wasm_type&lt;/code&gt;stuff is in, again just couldn't squeeze it in&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8 byte types (&lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;long long&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;some other small things like pre/post cremements, in-place initialization, etc., which just didn't quite fit&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;any sort of standard library or i/o that isn't returning an integer from &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;casting expressions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler passes 34/220 test cases in the c-testsuite. More importantly to me, it can compile and run the following program successfully:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int swap(int* a, int* b) {
  int t;
  t = *a; *a = *b; *b = t;
  return t;
}

int fib(int n) {
  int a, b;
  for (a = b = 1; n &amp;gt; 2; n = n - 1) {
    swap(&amp;amp;a, &amp;amp;b);
    b = b + a;
  }
  return b;
}

int main() {
  return fib(10); // 55
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, enough about deciding things, let's get into the code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Helper types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a small collection of helper types and classes that the compiler uses. None of them are particularly strange, so I'll pass over them fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Emitter&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:21)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a singleton helper to emit nicely-formatted WebAssembly code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WebAssembly, at least the textual format, is formatted as s-expressions, but individual instructions don't need to be parenthesized:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(module
  ;; &amp;lt;snip...&amp;gt;
  (func $swap
    (param $a i32)
    (param $b i32)
    (result i32)
    global.get $__stack_pointer ;; prelude -- adjust stack pointer
    i32.const 12
    i32.sub
    ;; &amp;lt;snip...&amp;gt;
  )
)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Emitter&lt;/code&gt; just helps with emitting code with nice indentation so it's easier to read.
It also has a &lt;code&gt;no_emit&lt;/code&gt; method, which will be used for an ugly hack later‚Äîstay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;StringPool (compiler.py:53)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt; holds all the string constants so they can be arranged in a contiguous region of memory, and hands out addresses into that for the codegen to use.
When you write &lt;code&gt;char *s = "abc"&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt;, what really happens is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;appends a null terminator&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;checks if it's already stored&lt;code&gt;"abc"&lt;/code&gt;, and if so, just hands that address back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;adds it to a dictionary along with the base address + the total byte length stored so far‚Äîthe address of this new string in the pool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;hands that address back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When all the code is finished compiling, we create an &lt;code&gt;rodata&lt;/code&gt;section with the giant concatenated string produced by&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;, stored at the string pool base address (retroactively making all the addresses&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;handed out valid)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Lexer&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:98)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Lexer&lt;/code&gt; class is complex, because lexing C is complex (&lt;code&gt;(\\([\\abfnrtv'"?]|[0-7]{1,3}|x[A-Fa-f0-9]{1,2}))&lt;/code&gt; is a real regex in that code for character escapes), but conceptually simple: the lexer marches along identifying what the token at the current position is.
The caller can peek that token, or it can use &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; to tell the lexer to advance, "consuming" that token.
It can also use &lt;code&gt;try_next&lt;/code&gt; to conditionally advance only if the next token is a certain kind‚Äîbasically, &lt;code&gt;try_next&lt;/code&gt; is a shortcut for &lt;code&gt;if self.peek().kind == token: return self.next()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's some additionally complexity because of something called the "lexer hack". Essentially, when parsing C you want to know if something is a type name or variable name (because that context matters for compiling certain expressions), but there's no syntactic distinction between them: &lt;code&gt;int int_t = 0;&lt;/code&gt; is perfectly valid C, as is &lt;code&gt;typedef int int_t; int_t x = 0;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To know if an arbitrary token &lt;code&gt;int_t&lt;/code&gt; is a type name or a variable name, we need to feed type information from the parsing/codegen stage back into the lexer.
This is a giant pain for regular compilers that want to keep their lexer, parser, and codegen modules pure and plantonically separate, but it's actually not very hard for us!
I'll explain it more when we get to the &lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt; section, but basically we just keep &lt;code&gt;types: set[str]&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Lexer&lt;/code&gt;, and when lexing, check if a token is in that set before giving it a token kind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if m := re.match(r"^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*", self.src[self.loc :]):
    tok = m.group(0)
    ...
    # lexer hack
    return Token(TOK_TYPE if tok in self.types else TOK_NAME, tok, self.line)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CType&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:201)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just a dataclass for representing information about a C type, like you'd write in &lt;code&gt;int **t&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;short t[5]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;char **t[17]&lt;/code&gt;, minus the &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It contains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the type's name (with any typedefs resolved), such as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;what level of pointer is is (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;= not a pointer,&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int *t&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int **t&lt;/code&gt;, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;what the array size is (&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;= not an array,&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int t[0]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int t[1]&lt;/code&gt;, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, as mentioned before, this type only supports single-level arrays, and not nested arrays like &lt;code&gt;int t[5][6]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FrameVar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;StackFrame&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:314)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These classes handle our C stack frames.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, because you can't take references to the WASM stack, we have to manually handle the C stack, we can't use the WASM one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To set up the C stack, the prelude emitted in &lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt; sets up a global &lt;code&gt;__stack_pointer&lt;/code&gt; variable, and then every function call decrements that by however much space the function needs for its parameters and local variables‚Äîcalculated by that function's &lt;code&gt;StackFrame&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll go over how that calculation works in more detail when we get to parsing functions, but essentially, each parameter and local variable gets a slot in that stack space, and increases &lt;code&gt;StackFrame.frame_size&lt;/code&gt; (and thus the offset of the next variable) depending on its size.
The offset, type information, and other data for each parameter and local variable are stored in a &lt;code&gt;FrameVar&lt;/code&gt; instance, in &lt;code&gt;StackFrame.variables&lt;/code&gt;, in order of declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:344)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This final dataclass is used to track whether the result of an expression is a value or a place. We need to keep track of this distinction in order to handle certain expressions differently based on how they're used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if you have a variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, it can be used in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt;wants the value of&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, say&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, to operate on&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x&lt;/code&gt;wants the address of&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, say&lt;code&gt;0xcafedead&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we parse the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; expression, we can easily fetch the address from the stack frame:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# look the variable up in the `StackFrame`
var, offset = frame.get_var_and_offset(varname)
# put the base address of the C stack on top of the WASM stack
emit(f"global.get $__stack_pointer")
# add the offset (in the C stack)
emit(f"i32.const {offset}")
emit("i32.add")
# the address of the variable is now on top of the WASM stack
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now what? If we &lt;code&gt;i32.load&lt;/code&gt; this address to get the value, then &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x&lt;/code&gt; will have no way to get the address.
But if we don't load it, then &lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt; will try to add one to the address, resulting in &lt;code&gt;0xcafedeae&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's where &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; comes in: we leave the address on the stack, and return an &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; indicating this is a place:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;return ExprMeta(True, var.type)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, for operations like &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; that always want to operate on values instead of places, there's a function &lt;code&gt;load_result&lt;/code&gt; that turns any places into values:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def load_result(em: ExprMeta) -&amp;gt; ExprMeta:
    """Load a place `ExprMeta`, turning it into a value
    `ExprMeta` of the same type"""
    if em.is_place:
        # emit i32.load, i32.load16_s, etc., based on the type
        emit(em.type.load_ins())
    return ExprMeta(False, em.type)

...
# in the code for parsing `+`
lhs_meta = load_result(parse_lhs())
...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an operation like &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; just doesn't load the result, and instead leaves the address on the stack: in an important sense, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is a no-op in our compiler, since it doesn't emit any code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if lexer.try_next("&amp;amp;"):
    meta = prefix()
    if not meta.is_place:
        die("cannot take reference to value", lexer.line)
    # type of &amp;amp;x is int* when x is int, hence more_ptr
    return ExprMeta(False, meta.type.more_ptr())
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note also that, despite being an address, the result of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; isn't a place! (The code returns an &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;is_place=False&lt;/code&gt;.)
The result of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; should be treated like a value, since &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x + 1&lt;/code&gt; should add &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; (or rather, &lt;code&gt;sizeof(x)&lt;/code&gt;) to the address.
That's why we need the place/value distinction, since just "being an address" isn't enough to know whether the result of an expression should be loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, enough about helper classes. Let's move on to the meat of codegen!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parsing and code generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general control flow of the compiler goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blue rectangles represent the main functions of the compiler‚Äî&lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;global_declaration()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt;.
The long chain of squares at the bottom shows the operator precedence‚Äîmost of those functions are automatically generated by a higher-order function, however!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll go through the blue squares one-by-one and explain anything interesting in each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:827)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is pretty short and dull. Here it is in full:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if __name__ == "__main__":
    import fileinput

    with fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8") as fi:
        compile("".join(fi))  # todo: make this line-at-a-time?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly I never finished that TODO! The only really interesting thing here is the &lt;code&gt;fileinput&lt;/code&gt; module, which you may not have heard of.
From the module docs,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Typical use is:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;import fileinput for line in fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8"): process(line)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:], defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty. If a filename is '-' it is also replaced by sys.stdin and the optional arguments mode and openhook are ignored. To specify an alternative list of filenames, pass it as the argument to input(). A single file name is also allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means, technically, &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt; supports multiple files!
(If you don't mind them all being concatenated and having messed-up line numbers :-) &lt;code&gt;fileinput&lt;/code&gt; is actually fairly sophisticated and has a &lt;code&gt;filelineno()&lt;/code&gt; method, I just didn't use it for space reasons.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:805)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt; is the first interesting function here, and is short enough to also include verbatim:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def compile(src: str) -&amp;gt; None:
    # compile an entire file

    with emit.block("(module", ")"):
        emit("(memory 3)")
        emit(f"(global $__stack_pointer (mut i32) (i32.const {PAGE_SIZE * 3}))")

        emit("(func $__dup_i32 (param i32) (result i32 i32)")
        emit("  (local.get 0) (local.get 0))")
        emit("(func $__swap_i32 (param i32) (param i32) (result i32 i32)")
        emit("  (local.get 1) (local.get 0))")

        global_frame = StackFrame()
        lexer = Lexer(src, set(["int", "char", "short", "long", "float", "double"]))
        while lexer.peek().kind != TOK_EOF:
            global_declaration(global_frame, lexer)

        emit('(export "main" (func $main))')

        # emit str_pool data section
        emit(f'(data $.rodata (i32.const {str_pool.base}) "{str_pool.pooled()}")')
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This function handles emitting the module level prelude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we emit a pragma for the WASM VM to reserve 3 pages of memory (&lt;code&gt;(memory 3)&lt;/code&gt;), and we set the stack pointer to start at the end of that reserved region (it will grow downwards).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we define two stack manipulation helpers &lt;code&gt;__dup_i32&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__swap_i32&lt;/code&gt;.
These should be familiar if you've ever used Forth: &lt;code&gt;dup&lt;/code&gt; duplicates the item on top of the WASM stack (&lt;code&gt;a -- a a&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; swaps the position of the top two items on the WASM stack (&lt;code&gt;a b -- b a&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we initialize a stack frame to hold the global variables, initialize the lexer with the built-in typenames for the lexer hack, and chew up global declarations until we run out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we export &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and dump the string pool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;global_declaration()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:743)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This function is too long to inline the whole thing, but the signature looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def global_declaration(global_frame: StackFrame, lexer: Lexer) -&amp;gt; None:
    # parse a global declaration -- typedef, global variable, or function.
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It handles typedefs, global variables, and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typedefs are cool, since this is where the lexer hack happens!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if lexer.try_next("typedef"):
    # yes, `typedef int x[24];` is valid (but weird) c
    type, name = parse_type_and_name(lexer)
    # lexer hack!
    lexer.types.add(name.content)
    typedefs[name.content] = type

    lexer.next(";")
    return
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We reuse a general type-name parsing tool since typedefs inherit all of C's weird "declaration reflects usage" rules, which is convenient for us. (and less so for the perplexed newbie!) Then we inform the lexer we've discovered a new type name, so that in the future that token will be lexed as a type name instead of a variable name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally for typedefs, we store the type in the global typedef registry, consume the trailing semicolon, and return back to &lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt; for the next global declaration.
Importantly, the type we store is a whole parsed type, since if you do &lt;code&gt;typedef int* int_p;&lt;/code&gt; and then later write &lt;code&gt;int_p *x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; should get a resulting type of &lt;code&gt;int**&lt;/code&gt;‚Äîthe pointer level is additive!
That means we can't just store the base C typename, and instead need to store an entire &lt;code&gt;CType&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the declaration wasn't a typedef, we parse a variable type and name. If we find a &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; token we know it's a global variable declaration (since we don't support global initializers).
In that case, we add the global variable to the global stack frame and bail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if lexer.try_next(";"):
    global_frame.add_var(name.content, decl_type, False)
    return
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there's no semicolon, however, we're definitely dealing with a function. To generate code for a function, we need to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a new &lt;code&gt;StackFrame&lt;/code&gt;for the function, named&lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then, parse all the parameters and store them in the frame with &lt;code&gt;frame.add_var(varname.content, type, is_parameter=True)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After that, parse all the variable declarations with &lt;code&gt;variable_declaration(lexer, frame)&lt;/code&gt;, which adds them to&lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Now we know how large the function's stack frame needs to be (&lt;code&gt;frame.frame_size&lt;/code&gt;), so we can start emitting the prelude!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First, for all the parameters in the stack frame (added with &lt;code&gt;is_parameter=True&lt;/code&gt;), we generate WASM&lt;code&gt;param&lt;/code&gt;declarations so the function can be called with the WASM calling convention (passing the parameters on the WASM stack):&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for v in frame.variables.values():
    if v.is_parameter:
        emit(f"(param ${v.name} {v.type.wasmtype})")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then, we can emit a &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;annotation for the return type, and adjust the C stack pointer to make space for the function's parameters and variables:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;emit(f"(result {decl_type.wasmtype})")
emit("global.get $__stack_pointer")
# grow the stack downwards
emit(f"i32.const {frame.frame_offset + frame.frame_size}")
emit("i32.sub")
emit("global.set $__stack_pointer")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each parameter (in reverse order, because stacks), copy it from the WASM stack to our stack:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for v in reversed(frame.variables.values()):
    if v.is_parameter:
        emit("global.get $__stack_pointer")
        emit(f"i32.const {frame.get_var_and_offset(v.name)[1]}")
        emit("i32.add")
        # fetch the variable from the WASM stack
        emit(f"local.get ${v.name}")
        # and store it at the calculated address in the C stack
        emit(v.type.store_ins())
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, we can call &lt;code&gt;statement(lexer, frame)&lt;/code&gt;in a loop to codegen all the statements in the function, until we hit the closing bracket:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;while not lexer.try_next("}"):
    statement(lexer, frame)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bonus step: we assume the function will always have a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, so we&lt;code&gt;emit("unreachable")&lt;/code&gt;so the WASM analyzer doesn't freak out.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whoof! That was a lot. But that's all for functions, and thus for &lt;code&gt;global_declaration()&lt;/code&gt;, so let's move on to &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:565)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a lot of code in &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt;.
However, most of it is fairly repetitive, so I'll just explain &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, which should give a good overview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember how WASM doesn't have jumps, and instead has structured control flow? That's relevant now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let's see how it works with &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, where it's not too much trouble.
A while loop in WASM looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;block
  loop
    ;; &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
    i32.eqz
    br_if 1
    ;; &amp;lt;loop body&amp;gt;
    br 0
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are two types of blocks‚Äî&lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; (there's also an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; block type, which I didn't use).
Each encloses some number of statements and then ends with &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;.
Inside a block, you can break with &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt;, or conditionally based on the top of the WASM stack with &lt;code&gt;br_if&lt;/code&gt; (there's also &lt;code&gt;br_table&lt;/code&gt;, which I didn't use).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; family takes a labelidx parameter, here either &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, which is what level of block the operation applies to.
So in our while loop, the &lt;code&gt;br_if 1&lt;/code&gt; applies to the outer block‚Äîindex 1, while the &lt;code&gt;br 0&lt;/code&gt; applies to the inner block‚Äîindex 0. (indices are always relative to the instruction in question‚Äî0 is the innermost block to that instruction.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the last rule to know is that a &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; jumps forwards, to the end of the &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt;, whereas a &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; jumps backwards, to the beginning of the &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So hopefully the while loop code makes sense now! Looking at it again,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;block
  loop
    ;; &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
    i32.eqz

    ;; if test == 0, jump forwards (1 = labelidx of the `block`),
    ;; out of the loop
    br_if 1

    ;; &amp;lt;loop body&amp;gt;

    ;; unconditionally jump backwards (0 = labelidx of the `loop`).
    ;; to the beginning of the loop
    br 0
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In more normal assembly, this would correspond to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.loop_start
  ;; &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
  jz .block_end
  ;; &amp;lt;loop body&amp;gt;
  jmp .loop_start
.block_end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But with jumps, you can express things that you can't (easily) in WASM‚Äîfor example, you could jump into the middle of a block.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This mainly is an issue for compiling C's &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;, which I didn't even attempt‚Äîthere's an algorithm that can transform any code using &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; into an equivalent program using structured control flow, but it's complicated and I don't think it would work with our single-pass approach.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for while loops, this isn't too bad. All we have to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# `emit.block` is a context manager to emit the first parameter ("block" here),
# and then the second ("end") on exit
with emit.block("block", "end"):
    with emit.block("loop", "end"):
        # emit code for the test, ending with `i32.eqz`
        parenthesized_test()
        # emit code to exit the loop if the `i32.eqz` was true
        emit("br_if 1")
        # emit code for the body
        bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)
        # emit code to jump back to the beginning
        emit("br 0")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With for loops though, it gets nasty. Consider a for loop like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 5; i = i + 1) {
    j = j * 2 + i;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The order the parts of the for loop will be seen by the lexer/code generator is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;i = 0&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;i &amp;lt; 5&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;i = i + 1&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;j = j * 2 + i&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the order we need to put them in the code, to work with WASM's structured control flow, is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;block
  ;; &amp;lt; code for `i = 0` (1) &amp;gt;
  loop
    ;; &amp;lt; code for `i &amp;lt; 5` (2) &amp;gt;
    br_if 1
    ;; &amp;lt; code for `j = j * 2 + i` (4!) &amp;gt;
    ;; &amp;lt; code for `i = i + 1` (3!) &amp;gt;
    br 0
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that 3 and 4 are inverted in the generated code, making the order 1, 2, 4, 3. This is a problem for a single pass compiler! Unlike a normal compiler, we can't store the advancement statement for later. Or‚Ä¶ can we?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How I ended up handling this is by making the lexer cloneable, and re-parsing the advancement statement after parsing the body. Essentially, the code looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;elif lexer.try_next("for"):
    lexer.next("(")
    with emit.block("block", "end"):
        # parse initializer (i = 0)
        # (outside of loop since it only happens once)
        if lexer.peek().kind != ";":
            expression(lexer, frame)
            emit("drop") # discard result of initializer
        lexer.next(";")

        with emit.block("loop", "end"):
            # parse test (i &amp;lt; 5), if present
            if lexer.peek().kind != ";":
                load_result(expression(lexer, frame))
                emit("i32.eqz ;; for test")
                emit("br_if 1 ;; exit loop")
            lexer.next(";")

            # handle first pass of advancement statement, if present
            saved_lexer = None
            if lexer.peek().kind != ")":
                saved_lexer = lexer.clone()
                # emit.no_emit() disables code output inside of it,
                # so we can skip over the advancement statement for now
                # to get to the for loop body
                with emit.no_emit():
                    expression(lexer, frame)
            lexer.next(")")

            # parse body
            bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)

            # now that we parsed the body, go back and re-parse
            # the advancement statement using the saved lexer
            if saved_lexer != None:
                expression(saved_lexer, frame)

            # jump back to beginning of loop
            emit("br 0")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, the hack is to save the lexer, then use that to go back and handle the advancement statement later, instead of saving the syntax tree like a normal compiler would. Not very elegant‚Äîcompiling for loops is probably the gnarliest code in the compiler‚Äîbut it works well enough!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other parts of &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt; are mostly similar, so I'll skip over them to get to the last main part of the compiler‚Äî&lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:375)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt; is the last big method in the compiler, and it handles parsing expressions, as you might expect.
It contains many inner methods, one for each precedence level, each returning the &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; struct described earlier (which handle the "place vs value" distinction and can be turned into a value using &lt;code&gt;load_result&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom of the precedence stack is &lt;code&gt;value()&lt;/code&gt; (somewhat confusingly named, since it can return &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta(is_place=True, ...)&lt;/code&gt;).
It handles constants, parenthesized expressions, function calls, and variable names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above that, the basic pattern for a precedence level is a function like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; def muldiv() -&amp;gt; ExprMeta:
    # lhs is the higher precedence operation (prefix operators, in this case)
    lhs_meta = prefix()
    # check if we can parse an operation
    if lexer.peek().kind in ("*", "/", "%"):

        lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta)
        # grab the specific operator
        op_token = lexer.next()
        # the right hand side should use this function, for e.g. `x * y * z`
        load_result(muldiv())
        # emit an opcode to do the operation
        if op_token == "*":
            emit(f"i32.mul")
        elif op_token == "/":
            emit(f"i32.div_s")
        else: # %
            emit(f"i32.rem_s")
        # mask down the result if this is a less-than-32bit type

    return lhs_meta
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, this pattern is so consistent that most operations, including &lt;code&gt;muldiv&lt;/code&gt;, aren't written out, but instead defined by a higher-order function &lt;code&gt;makeop&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# function for generating simple operator precedence levels from declarative

            return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type)
        return lhs_meta

    return op

muldiv = makeop(prefix, {"*": "i32.mul", "/": "i32.div_s", "%": "i32.rem_s"})
...
shlr = makeop(plusminus, {"&amp;lt;&amp;lt;": "i32.shl", "&amp;gt;&amp;gt;": "i32.shr_s"})
cmplg = makeop(
    shlr,
    {"&amp;lt;": "i32.lt_s", "&amp;gt;": "i32.gt_s", "&amp;lt;=": "i32.le_s", "&amp;gt;=": "i32.ge_s"},
    CType("int"),
)
cmpe = makeop(cmplg, {"==": "i32.eq", "!=": "i32.ne"}, CType("int"))
bitand = makeop(cmpe, {"&amp;amp;": "i32.and"})
bitor = makeop(bitand, {"|": "i32.or"})
xor = makeop(bitor, {"^": "i32.xor"})
...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only a few operations with special behavior need to be defined explicitly, like &lt;code&gt;plusminus&lt;/code&gt; which needs to handle the nuances of C pointer math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's it! That's the last main piece of the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrapping up...&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's been our tour of the C compiler in 500 lines of Python! Compilers have a reputation for being complex‚ÄîGCC and Clang are massive, and even TCC, the Tiny C Compiler, is tens of thousands of lines of code‚Äîbut if you're willing to sacrifice code quality and do everything in a single pass, they can be surprisingly compact!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd be interested to hear if you write your own single-pass compiler‚Äîmaybe for a custom language? I think this kind of compiler could potentially be a great stage0 for a self-hosted language, since it's so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Speeding up PyTorch inference by 87% on Apple devices with AI-generated Metal kernels&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Our lab investigated whether frontier models can write optimized GPU kernels for Apple devices to speed up inference. We found that they can: our AI-generated Metal kernels were 1.87x faster across 215 PyTorch modules, with some workloads running hundreds of times faster than baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why use AI to generate kernels for Apple devices?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI models execute on hardware via GPU kernels that define each operation. The efficiency of those kernels determines how fast models run (in training and inference). Kernel optimizations like FlashAttention1 show dramatic speedups over baseline, underscoring the need for performant kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While PyTorch and tools like &lt;code&gt;torch.compile&lt;/code&gt;2 handle some kernel optimizations, the last mile of performance still depends on handtuned kernels. These kernels are difficult to write, requiring significant time and expertise. It gets especially challenging when writing kernels outside of CUDA: expertise in non-CUDA platforms is rarer, and there is less tooling and documentation available&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We set out to answer a simple question: could frontier models implement kernel optimizations automatically, across different backends? Billions of Apple devices rely on Metal kernels that are often under-optimized, so we started with Metal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our vision: Autonomous kernel optimization for any target platform using frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across 215 PyTorch modules, our results show the generated kernels ran 87% faster on Apple hardware compared to baseline PyTorch. This approach requires no expertise in kernel engineering and can be done nearly instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a preview of what we discovered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many cases where our approach improved performance by 10-100X&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cases where models surfaced algorithmically unnecessary work and removed it (that PyTorch didn't catch)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The impact of incorporating performance profiling and CUDA reference code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why a simple agentic swarm dominates over individual frontier models&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We included 8 frontier models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, and OpenAI in our analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic family&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;claude-sonnet-4 (2025-05-14)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;claude-opus-4 (2025-05-14)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenAI family&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;gpt-4o (2024-11-20)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;gpt-4.1 (2025-04-14)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;gpt-5 (2025-08-07)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;o3 (2025-04-16)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DeepSeek family&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;deepseek-v3 (2025-03-25)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;deepseek-r1 (2025-05-28)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of test inputs, we used the PyTorch modules defined in the KernelBench3 dataset. KernelBench contains 250 PyTorch modules defining ML workloads of varying complexity. 31 modules contain operations that are currently unsupported in the PyTorch backend for MPS (Metal Performance Shaders), so they were excluded from this analysis. (We ended up excluding 4 additional modules for reasons that will be discussed later.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;KernelBench Category&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;# of Test Cases&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Level 1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Simple primitive operations (e.g. matrix multiplication, convolution)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;91&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Level 2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sequences of multiple operations from Level 1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;74&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Level 3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complete model architectures (e.g. AlexNet, VGG)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;50&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When evaluating the agent-generated kernels, we need to assess both correctness and performance relative to the baseline PyTorch implementation (at the time of writing, &lt;code&gt;torch.compile&lt;/code&gt; support for Metal is still underway, so it could not serve as a comparison point. MLX is also a great framework for Apple devices, but this work focused on pure PyTorch code optimization, whereas MLX is its own framework). We also made sure to carefully clear the cache between runs, otherwise cached results can falsely present as speedups.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Dataset&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;KernelBench&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Baseline Implementation&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;PyTorch eager mode&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Number of shots&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;First approach: A simple, kernel-writing agent for Metal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We begin with the simplest implementation of the kernel-writing agent for Metal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Receives the prompt and PyTorch code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generates Metal kernels&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assesses if they match the baseline PyTorch for correctness4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If they fail to compile or are not correct, an error message is passed back to the agent for another try, with up to 5 tries permitted.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's interesting to see how the correctness increases with the number of attempts. o3, for example, gets a working implementation about 60% of the time on the first try, and reaches 94% working implementations by attempt 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;o3's success rate by generation attempt and kernel level. We limited the agent to 5 tries, which seems sufficient for Level 1 and 2 kernels, but Level 3 kernels may benefit from further shots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's look at each of our 8 models correctness rates, broken down by whether or not the implementation was faster than our baseline or not:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kernel correctness, broken down by whether or not the optimized version was faster than the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reasoning models are pretty good at generating correct kernels across levels, although the non-reasoning models are also capable of doing this sometimes. However, other than GPT-5, these models are more often generating implementations that are slower than the baseline PyTorch. GPT-5's success at generating faster implementations for Level 2 problems is particularly notable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How did the generated kernels do?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every agent produced some kernels that were faster than baseline, and some of them came up with pretty cool stuff. GPT-5 produced a 4.65X speedup for a Mamba 25 state space model, primarily by fusing kernels to reduce the overhead of kernel launch and improve memory access patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some of the optimizations were surprisingly clever. In one case, o3 improved latency by over 9000X! o3 assessed the code and identified that given the model's configuration, the results would always be 0s, mathematically. This was not a trivial realization, but it did make the implementation itself trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were 4 problems, all from Level 2, where the most optimal implementation showed that the problem could be reduced to a trivial solution. Despite the true cleverness shown by the models, we excluded these from our analysis - but in the real use cases with imperfect code, this type of speedup mechanism would be quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One interesting thing to note is that the AI-generated kernels don't actually have to be faster every single time to be useful. For long running workloads, it makes sense to profile different implementations - this could even happen automatically. So as long as the AI-generated implementation is sometimes faster, it's valuable - we can always fall back to the baseline implementation when the AI-generated implementation doesn't work or is slower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's evaluate the average speedup compared to the baseline for each of our 8 agents. Based on our realization above, the minimum speedup is always 1X - this is the case where the generated implementation either doesn't work or is slower than the baseline. We use the geometric mean here rather than the arithmetic mean6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Average speedup by model, broken down by level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see that using GPT-5 produces an average speedup of ~20%, with the other models trailing. One possible conclusion: we should use GPT-5 for kernel generation, possibly giving it some additional context. This would make sense if all of the models tended to behave the same way - generally finding the same optimizations on a consistent set of problems, and failing to optimize other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't what the data actually shows though! Breaking it down by which model did the best across problems, we see that GPT-5 does the best, at 34% of problems where it generates the best solution. But there are another 30% of problems where another model generated a better solution than GPT-5!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across problem levels, this chart shows which model performed the best (or baseline if none of the models beat the baseline performance).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;An agentic swarm for kernel generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads to a key insight: kernel generation should use a "Best of N" strategy. Extra generation passes are relatively cheap, it's human effort and the runtime of the model (once deployed) that are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our flow for optimized kernel generation now looks like an agentic swarm. We have a supervisor, which is simple for now. It assesses the generated kernels across all agents, times them against the baseline, and then selects the optimal implementation for the problem. The ability to time and verify implementations against a baseline makes kernel generation a really good candidate for AI generation - it's much more convenient than some other code generation use cases, because we need minimal supervision to evaluate results on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The architecture of our agentic swarm for kernel generation. In this iteration, the supervisor is simple, but in upcoming work we will extend the supervisor to be more dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's see how our agentic swarm performs compared to the standalone models' performance from earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Performance of the initial agentic swarm implementation for kernel generation, showing significantly improved results compared to standalone agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see this approach gives us better results than even GPT-5 - an average 31% speedup across all levels, 42% speedup in Level 2 problems. The agentic swarm is doing a pretty good job already with minimal context - just the input problem and prompt. Next, we tried giving more context to the agents in order to get even faster kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Adding more context to improve performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What information would a human kernel engineer need to improve the performance of their hand-written kernels? Two key sources come to mind: another optimized reference implementation, and profiling information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, we gave our agents the power to take in two additional sources of information when generating kernels for Metal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A CUDA implementation for those kernels (since optimized CUDA references are often available due to the pervasiveness of Nvidia GPUs)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Profiling information from gputrace on the M4.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Apple does not make the Metal kernel profiling information easy to pull programmatically via Xcode‚Ä¶ So we had to get creative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We solved the problem by using Bluem's cliclick tool to interact with Xcode's GUI. Our Apple Script capture summary, memory and timeline views for each collected gputrace:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example screenshot from Xcode used for analysis. You can see in the screenshot above that there is a clear pipeline bubble after the ndArrayPooling, resulting in idle time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could only add profiling information to models that support multimodal inputs. We divided out the screenshot processing into a subagent, whose job it was to provide performance optimization hints to the main model. The main agent took an initial pass at implementation, which was then profiled and timed. Screenshots were then passed to the subagent to generate performance hints. The maximum number of shots remained the same as before - 5 shots total.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subagent architecture&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to our previous finding that the best model varied depending on the problem, we also saw that there was no "single best" configuration in terms of context. Sometimes, adding just one piece of information - either the CUDA reference code or the profiling information - produced the best result. Other times, adding both was helpful. There were still cases where the pure agents with no additional context performed better than the agents with more context!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best agent context configuration by problem level. We can see that the baseline PyTorch is now only superior to the best generated kernels in about ~8% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are particularly striking for Level 2 kernels. Our assessment is that this is because Level 2 kernels benefit more from fusion than Level 1 kernels. Level 3, on the other hand, may be too complex to generate in a single pass. Stay tuned for some improvements where we break down the problem into more manageable chunks for the agent to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, there were still some good kernels for Level 3. DeepSeek-R1 improved on the default implementation with advanced fusion techniques for a VisionAttention problem. It also showed awareness of Metal-specific features, leveraging threadgroups for more efficient shared memory. While there are still further optimization opportunities left on the table, this implementation was over 18X faster than the baseline PyTorch!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now, let's evaluate the performance of our agentic swarm. Previously, we did Best of N analysis across all frontier models. Now we do Best of N analysis across the different configurations of each frontier model (CUDA only, CUDA plus profiling, etc). Remember that generating multiple candidate implementations and testing them for performance is a lot "cheaper" than human experts manually writing the code, or running less optimized models at high volume - so offloading more generation to the swarm is worthwhile if it delivers noticeably better results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The overall performance of the full agentic swarm at kernel generation for Metal on the problems tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a great speedup - 1.87x better on average than the baseline, nearly instantly, directly from pure PyTorch code. The vanilla agents only saw a 1.31x average speedup, so adding in this additional context almost tripled the improvement we saw!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the distribution of improvements, we see that the median speedup was about 1.35X and 2 kernels were hundreds of times faster than the original implementation. (As mentioned before, we excluded the 4 "trivial" kernels, which were thousands of times faster by cutting out unnecessary work.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The distribution of speedups for the agentic swarm (215 problems total, 4 trivial kernels with large speedups excluded). Median speedup was 1.35X, (geometric) mean 1.87X, with 2 kernels 100X or more faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results show that it's possible to automatically drive significant improvements to model performance by automating the kernel optimization without any user code changes, new frameworks, or porting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI can take on portions of optimization that a human kernel engineer would do, leaving the human effort focused on the most complex optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon, developers can get immediate boosts to their model performance via AI-generated kernels, without low-level expertise or needing to leave pure PyTorch:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dynamically speeding up training workloads as they run&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic porting new models to new frameworks/devices (not just Metal)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Speeding up large scale inference workloads&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are hard at work at pushing the envelope further with this technique - smarter agent swarms, better context, more collaboration between agents, and more backends (ROCm, CUDA, SYCL, etc). We're also working on speeding up training workloads, not just inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this technique, new models can be significantly faster on every platform on day 0. If you're excited about this direction, we'd love to hear from you: hello@gimletlabs.ai.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can automatically speed up kernels across any target platform using this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

Let&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;be the generated kernel output, and&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;be the reference kernel output.

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;When averaging speedup ratios, the arithmetic mean will be falsely optimistic. Consider the case where you speed up a task by 2X, and then slow it down by 2X. This would be speedups of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2.0&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt;. The arithmetic mean would naively say you saw a speedup of&lt;code&gt;(2+0.5)/2 = 1.25&lt;/code&gt;, even though you stayed the same speed. The geometric mean would correctly say the speedup was&lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt;(no speedup). ‚Ü©&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This assembly language source code represents one of the most historically significant pieces of software from the early personal computer era. It is the complete source code for Microsoft BASIC Version 1.1 for the 6502 microprocessor, originally developed and copyrighted by Microsoft in 1976-1978.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This BASIC interpreter was the software foundation that powered many of the most influential early personal computers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It democratized programming by making it accessible to non-technical users through a simple, English-like programming language&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Without this software, the personal computer revolution might have developed very differently&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This represents some of Microsoft's earliest and most successful software&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The licensing of this BASIC interpreter to multiple computer manufacturers was crucial to Microsoft's early business model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It established Microsoft as a dominant force in personal computer software before MS-DOS or Windows&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This single codebase was designed to run on multiple different computer systems of the era&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The conditional compilation system allowed the same source code to target different hardware platforms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This approach influenced how software would be developed for decades to come&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source code includes conditional compilation support for multiple pioneering computer systems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple II (&lt;code&gt;REALIO=4&lt;/code&gt;) - Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak's revolutionary home computer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commodore PET (&lt;code&gt;REALIO=3&lt;/code&gt;) - One of the first complete personal computers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ohio Scientific (OSI) (&lt;code&gt;REALIO=2&lt;/code&gt;) - Popular among hobbyists and schools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MOS Technology KIM-1 (&lt;code&gt;REALIO=1&lt;/code&gt;) - An influential single-board computer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PDP-10 Simulation (&lt;code&gt;REALIO=0&lt;/code&gt;) - For development and testing purposes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Array support (both integer and string arrays)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mathematical functions and operators&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Character input/output abstraction&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional disk storage support&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source code includes detailed revision history showing active development:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 27, 1978: Fixed critical bugs in FOR loop variable handling and statement parsing&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;January 24, 1978: User-defined function improvements&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This BASIC interpreter introduced millions of people to computer programming&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It was the first programming language for countless programmers who later became industry leaders&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The simple, interactive nature of BASIC made computers approachable for non-technical users&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microsoft's BASIC became the de facto standard for personal computer programming&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The design patterns and conventions established here influenced later programming languages and development tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The multi-platform approach pioneered techniques still used in modern software development&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The licensing of this software to multiple hardware manufacturers created Microsoft's early business model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It demonstrated the viability of software as a standalone business, separate from hardware&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This approach became the template for the entire software industry&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This source code represents the foundation upon which the modern software industry was built. The techniques, patterns, and business models pioneered in this BASIC interpreter directly influenced:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

Viz., to make a sufficiently complicated data system containing an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a bitemporal database. Because? Because laying about on a hammock, contemplating hopelessly complected objects like Current Databases isn't just for the Rich man.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Their hard-won advice‚Äî"Just Use Postgres.", and "Please, for everyone's sake, stick with the relational models."‚Äîfell on deaf ears. 1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Obviously, I am also incapable of following my own advice.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hence this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take what is useful, discard the rest‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key take-away is: the accountants were right all along. Software engineers will do well, to cleverly copy the accountants 2. Now you may‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;View cat pictures instead.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Skip to the reference material. Definitely worth your time; pinky promise.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Skip to Architecture + Code; where the raw rubber tire of one's thinky-thought-ing meets the rough road of relentless Reality.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, grab a big beverage to help ingest the ten thousand tokens to follow‚Ä¶ Unless you are a Large Language Model. You can't drink. Sucks to be you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But beware. Once you see, you cannot un-see the fact that‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Any sufficiently complicated data system contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a bitemporal database.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;‚Äî Henderson's Tenth Law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Factual and Temporal World-Building&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Accountants are our exemplary archetype&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cashier at Temporal Convenience Store K9, just handed us our bill. Oi; where is that 10% discount applicable to our bulk purchase of provisions as loyal customers (it's going to be a long trip)?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we think that, but we ask politely, because we know there are many civil ways to sort this snafu without shoplifting or violence. Two universally accepted 3 remedies are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cashier has direct authority to fix it, and they may gladly oblige.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cashier's hands are sadly tied. For ERP reasons, accounts alone has authority to issue refunds for bills over a certain value. But we asked nicely so the cashier kindly nods us to accounts, in the backroom.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Odds are that the store people 4 will fix it by issuing two new transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One transaction to cancel the last bill and reverse the related charge to our spacecard.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Another transaction issuing the corrected bill, including the discounted amount, with a fresh charge made to our spacecard.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Temporal Convenience Store K9's various ledgers have received corresponding debits and credits too, of course. But enough. A programmer, though Poor, is no Fool. One does not simply trespass The Field of Accountants. There be dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So‚Ä¶ Back to the DB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way or another, the store's accounting database must tell these facts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At TxTime-7543, Cashier-Adric at Store-K9 ISSUED bill ID-13579 having value 100 spacecoin, and charged it to SpaceCard-1337.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At TxTime-7587, Cashier-Adric at Store-K9 REVERSED bill ID-13579 having value 100 spacecoin, and refunded it to SpaceCard-1337. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Maaaybe a note about why it was reversed. 5&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At TxTime-7715, Accounts-Nyssa at Store-K9 ISSUED bill ID-13579-v2 for 90 spacecoin, with a total value of 100 spacecoin minus 10 spacecoin going to discount, and charged 90 spacecoin to SpaceCard-1337.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We call this a temporal data system because it incorporates the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No information is ever modified in-place or deleted.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New information is always appended.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To grok the latest state of the accounts, one must read the sequence of all facts recorded in the database.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading a fact updates a separate, current view of the accounts‚Ä¶ our "as of now" understanding of the world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The "current view" can be rebuilt from scratch, up to any point in time, whether it is "as of now", or "as of last week", or "as of next quarter" (which will be useful only if we add synthetic projected-future events into the database).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So‚Ä¶ What to think about in order to design a general-purpose temporal data system that does this for us?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;All databases record state of entities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People, things, processes etc. State is the discrete value of some attribute of an entity at a specific point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Values are timeless and context free &lt;code&gt;(17)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attributes provide context &lt;code&gt;('age')&lt;/code&gt;, which we use to suggest and interpret the meaning of a value&lt;code&gt;(= age 17)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Entities are real or imaginary objects ( &lt;code&gt;Adric&lt;/code&gt;) having attributes (&lt;code&gt;age&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the State of Adric can be stated as: Adric's age is 17 as of now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a current database‚Äîwhich is just a fancy way of saying database‚Äîthe as of now is implicit. So is the concept of "&lt;code&gt;age&lt;/code&gt; is an attribute of the entity &lt;code&gt;Adric&lt;/code&gt;". We just call it Schema, in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;entity&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;age&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's re-state our traditional table as Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) triplets. Let's also add a column for time (as we often do) to answer questions like "when was Adric's age last updated in our database?".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;entity&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;attribute&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;value&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;age&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;as-of-date-time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this kernel shall spring forth our world, wrought of facts and time itself. But first, one must acknowledge that‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the world‚Äôs a stage,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;And all the men and women merely players;&lt;lb/&gt;They have their exits and their entrances,&lt;lb/&gt;And one man in his time plays many parts,&lt;lb/&gt;His acts being seven ages.&lt;p&gt;‚Äî William Shakespeare, As You Like It, Act-II, Scene-VII, Lines 139-143&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As my theater gentlefriends like to say‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Everything is Process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We understand the world in terms of processes. All of Reality is a live process which we want to participate in‚Äîcontrol, influence, react, adapt. Ergo, all information is part of some process. Yes, even universal constants like &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;œÄ&lt;/code&gt;, which we can confidently assume to be constant only in our observable universe. Because even these came to be after the moment of the big bang, and will remain only until the eventual heat death of the universe (assuming our universe is ever-expanding, and not a bouncing singularity).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It follows that, to understand the world, we must observe and respond to data; information about various attributes of various meaningful aspects of reality, as we perceive it. Said another way, we understand the world by observing and modifying the state of entities over time‚Äîthe past, the now, and the later. A person's address, a valve's current position, the remaining free volume of a container, the trajectory of a comet, one's fast-emptying savings account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;entity&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;attribute&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;value&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;age&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;as-of-date-time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;address&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Foo&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;as-of-date-time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;bitemporal belief&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;as-of-date-time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more sophisticated a being is, the more context about entities and entity-relationships it is able to keep alive and/or use simultaneously 6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The identity of an entity is the complete life it lives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never-ending process is the beating heart, the whistling wind, the pulsing quasar, the furious procreation, the tectonic Subduction, the whispered good-bye, the thermodynamic survival instinct of all things. Process is the why of being. One could even say that an entity without id can have no identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why, to properly identify an entity, we must egolessly maintain an up-to-date mental-model about it. For that, we must continually observe, record, and aggregate a succession of states of the entity in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consequently, knowledge of entity-attributes alone is not sufficient (Adric has age, address, belief). Knowledge of attribute-values is required too (age is x, address is y, belief is z). And without a sense of time, we simply cannot complete the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it concrete:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every person's life revolves around their address and we can guess different things about them based on how their address changes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You know which Adric is being spoken about because you know &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Adric's age was 17 last year. Adric's age is 18 as of now. Adric's age will be 319 on &amp;lt;specific date&amp;gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Adric's address was Foo last year. Adric's address is Baz as of now. Adric's address will be Bar after December 2025.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Adric's belief in bitemporality was 1% last year. Adric's belief in bitemporality is 99% as of now.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Adric's temporal innocence level was 99% last year. Adric's temporal innocence level is 1% as of now.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A reader of this set of facts can confidently determine: As-of-now, Adric is an eighteen year old entity that lives at 'Baz', believes strongly in bitemporality, and has nearly no temporal innocence.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;V&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;as-of-time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:age [:time :years]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-last-year&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:age [:time :years]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;18&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-now&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:age [:time :years]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;319&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-future&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:address [:text :string]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Foo&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-last-year&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:address [:text :string]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Baz&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-now&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:address [:text :string]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bar&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-future&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:belief [:bitemporality :%]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-last-year&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:belief [:bitemporality :%]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;99&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-now&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:innocence [:temporal :%]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;99&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-last-year&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:innocence [:temporal :%]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-now&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;KEY: E(ntity), A(ttribute), V(alue)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having gained this factual understanding, a dear reader may be tempted to further theorise; Adric lost his temporal innocence and eventually ended up living at 'Bar', where he always is these days. Of course, to prove such an allegation, the dear reader would have to piece together many more facts about Adric, and show causation, not mere correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dear reader may happily play temporal sleuth. However, the temporal database and temporal data engineer are not here to judge. Our role is simply to record the facts as presented, without ego, without prejudice, with integrity, so that the temporal data sleuth may use it productively to figure out what happened, when, and why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For there is more to facts than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"I'm not in the judgment business, Mr. Orr. I'm after facts. And the events of the mind, believe me, to me are facts. When you see another man's dream as he dreams it recorded in black and white on the electroencephalograph, as I've done ten thousand times, you don't speak of dreams as 'unreal.' They exist; they are events; they leave a mark behind them."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;‚Äî Dr. William Haber&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;The Lathe of Heaven, Ursula K. Le Guin.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A fact can be true or false&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The temporal sleuth knows that one must resolve the reality of a fact by asserting whether it is true or false.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our facts table can be expressed as something like the table below. Aspiring temporal data engineers will do well to avoid speculating why a fact might have been asserted true or false. Our ilk must simply realise that we can assert facts this way; &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;statement of fact&amp;gt; is &amp;lt;true/false?&amp;gt; as of &amp;lt;time&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each state of the Adric entity can thus be re-written as an assertion of a fact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Adric's age is 17" is a true fact as of date-last-year.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Adric's age is 17" is a false fact as of date-now.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;V&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;assert&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;as-of-time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:age [:time :years]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;true&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-last-year&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:age [:time :years]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;false&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-now&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;KEY: E(ntity), A(ttribute), V(alue)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With just this information, the temporal sleuth can infer that Adric's age definitely changed at least once sometime between date-last-year and date-now. But how many times, and to what value, is anybody's guess. For that, we need more temporal observations. Which thickens the plot. For now, we might receive conflicting observations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What happens when fact and fact collide?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You Won't Believe This One Trick Accountants Use To Deal With Changing Facts. They never delete old entries from their ledgers, they simply make new "correcting entries" (We established this in our motivating example.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier, we were told to record that the Adric entity's age is 17 as of date-last-year. Presently, we are told to make a note that Adric is NOT 17 any more. We have no idea about Adric's &lt;del&gt;birth date&lt;/del&gt; creation date, by the way. We just make a note of assertions of facts about Adric's age, as we are told.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;V&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;assert&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;as-of-time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:age [:time :years]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;true&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-last-year&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:age [:time :years]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;false&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-now&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;KEY: E(ntity), A(ttribute), V(alue)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, if anyone asks for Adric's age "as of now", the only truth we can tell is "we don't know". Think about this for a moment. How should we interrogate this temporal data store, to make sense of the information it contains? It's subtle. Hopefully all the thinky thoughting to come will build a clearer intuition. But we are out of time right now‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sixty seconds later, we are interrupted and told that Adric is in fact 18, and oh by the way, he was already 18 as of date-now. And does it bother us that we wrote the earlier thing down already? No it doesn't. We just assert the new fact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And just like that‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now if anyone asks for Adric's age "as of now", we can truthfully answer &lt;code&gt;18&lt;/code&gt;. Because now our table looks like‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;V&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;assert&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;as-of-time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:age [:time :years]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;true&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-last-year&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:age [:time :years]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;false&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-now&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;{:age [:time :years]}&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;18&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;true&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;date-now&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;KEY: E(ntity), A(ttribute), V(alue)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, we make note of other facts about Adric as of various dates on the timeline. But let's add one more key detail‚Ä¶ the time at which we made note of the information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Finally, the Two Questions that put the 'bi' in the 'bitemporal'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Events always occur before they can be recorded. It's just how nature works. Therefore, we can only ever make a note of a fact, after the fact. And so it comes to pass, that any self-respecting temporal sleuth naturally begins their temporal interrogation with two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When did it actually happen?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only a fact-sender may lay claim to the time an event occurred. And this timestamp must always travel with the fact. Whether the claimed timestamp is acceptable or not is between the fact-sender and the temporal sleuth. The temporal data store and engineer just make sure it is written down exactly as given.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When did we officially record it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only the temporal data store‚Äînot even the temporal data engineer‚Äîmay lay claim to when this happened. For the temporal data engineer is just a fallible puny human who can screw up in so many ways. Making typos. Misreading the clock. Lazily avoiding recording facts until the auditor comes a-calling. Or even forgetting the fact entirely, upon discovery of which fact, the temporal sleuth gets called in to piece together what might have happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, let's update our temporal data table with the "transaction" time, at which the data store guarantees that it has immutably inscribed a fact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ease table-reading life of our fellow our puny humans, we also rearrange the time columns a bit. Now, we can manually read records as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At Transaction Time &lt;code&gt;t02&lt;/code&gt;, the table recorded the following fact:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;As of &lt;code&gt;dt-now&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Adric&lt;/code&gt;'s&lt;code&gt;:age&lt;/code&gt;being&lt;code&gt;17&lt;/code&gt;stands REDACTED.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As of &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At Transaction Time &lt;code&gt;t03&lt;/code&gt;, the table recorded the following fact:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;As of &lt;code&gt;dt-now&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Adric&lt;/code&gt;'s&lt;code&gt;:age&lt;/code&gt;being&lt;code&gt;18&lt;/code&gt;stands ASSERTED.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As of &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;tx-time&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;as-of-time&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;V&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;assert&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;t01&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;dt-last-yr&lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This brings us to the absurdity of time travel‚Ä¶ For things to get better, they have to get weird first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Reality versus (data-based) Time-Travel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Why do you think your mother didn't notice that reality had changed since last night?"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;[Dr. Haber]&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Well, she didn't dream it. I mean, the dream really did change reality. It made a different reality, retroactively, which she'd been part of all along. Being in it, she had no memory of any other. I did, I remembered both, because I was‚Ä¶ there‚Ä¶ at the moment of the change. This is the only way I can explain it, I know it doesn't make sense. But I have got to have some explanation or else face the fact that I'm insane."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;[Mr. Orr]&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;The Lathe of Heaven, Ursula K. Le Guin.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actual Time Travel is different each time, because the very act of it interacts with and perturbs Reality. Not being higher dimensional beings, we have evolved to get by, by perceiving very little of very little. To us, convenient fictions are good enough Reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No temporal database can contain Reality itself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The Song" is a convenient fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We love to loop a favourite hit single. Yet‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A record is not "The Song". All recordings are lossy 7 because all acts of measurement are lossy. That's just physics.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A replay is not "The Song". Every replay is the same information yet it is new, because Reality is ever-moving, ever-changing. (Ignoring for a moment the fact that every replay degrades the storage medium‚Äîvinyl, compact disk, copper plate, SSD‚Äîcausing further information loss.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nor are live performances "The Song". Each rendition is different.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, temporal databases can only mimic Time Travel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The experience of Reality can only ever be captured as finite, discrete observations (samples and measurements).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Therefore, a temporal recording or database can only ever contain approximate observations of Reality.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each time we retrieve the observations, we cannot help but reinterpret them because we ourselves have changed in the interval.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can only ever sing songs about what we believed happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reality transpires in Dedekind cuts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This Instant" is a convenient fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every observation of reality exists somewhere inside of an interval, because our means of measurement can only ever approximate the moment of occurrence of an event. The idea of the Dedekind Cut frames this neatly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Dedekind cut is a partition of the rationals &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; into two subsets &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; such that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;is nonempty.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;A ‚â† Q&lt;/code&gt;(equivalently,&lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;is nonempty).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;x,y ‚àà Q&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;x &amp;lt; y&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;y ‚àà A&lt;/code&gt;, then&lt;code&gt;x ‚àà A&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;is "closed downwards".)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;x ‚àà A&lt;/code&gt;, then there exists a&lt;code&gt;y ‚àà A&lt;/code&gt;such that&lt;code&gt;y &amp;gt; x&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;does not contain a greatest element.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By omitting the first two requirements, we formally obtain the extended real number line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why split such philosophical hairs? Why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because, we must record temporal facts with proper temporal resolution. For example, an infinitesimal such as a Femtosecond (10-15s) can be‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Just Right‚Ä¶ for that "Femto Laser" Cataract removal or LASIK surgery.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Waaay over the top‚Ä¶ for orchestral arrangements where sub-millisecond (&amp;lt; 10-3s) coordination is more than enough.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Or too coarse(!)‚Ä¶ for Quantum dynamics studies, where incredible things happen in attoseconds (10-18s). 8&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More subtly, because all Temporal Data Processing queries are Interval queries, served by collating facts that happened starting Time X to Time Y.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, "Calculate the state of the world &lt;code&gt;as-of&lt;/code&gt; some &lt;code&gt;Instant&lt;/code&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To serve this query, we must collate all facts starting from the earliest available ones, right up to whatever &lt;code&gt;as-of&lt;/code&gt; time Instant. It could be &lt;code&gt;as-of&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;some past moment&amp;gt;, or &lt;code&gt;as-of&lt;/code&gt; some projected future, or‚Ä¶. &lt;code&gt;as-of&lt;/code&gt; this very instant, a.k.a. a &lt;code&gt;now&lt;/code&gt; query.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;now&lt;/code&gt; query is a special-case &lt;code&gt;as-of&lt;/code&gt; query, because &lt;code&gt;now&lt;/code&gt; is an expanding query window‚Ä¶ ever-increasing "wall-clock time". It means our computer's temporal resolution, which the temporal database relies on, must suit that of incoming facts. My cheap wristwatch will botch your Formula One lap times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: The &lt;code&gt;now&lt;/code&gt; query returns a Current Database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Facts contain observations. Observations are not Reality.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Facts" are a convenient fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To fact-find, we must observe. Observation requires measurement. Measurements are inherently lossy. Consequently, no collection of facts, no matter how fine-grained can ever capture Reality as it actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides, facts depend on who's observing. Having experienced the world a bit, we have doubtless realised that, routinely‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The same party told us "use this fact", at different times, with no regard to whatever happened in-between.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OR, it's possible that the same party sent us two different facts at the same time, but they were recorded in the table at different times. Maybe the temporal database recorded one fact, but before it could record the other fact, it got waylaid by a VACUUM emergency. It happens.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OOOORRRR, it is possible that two different parties with different vantage points of a shared reality sent their observations independently, without being aware that other party even exists. Our temporal database just says "okay then", and records both claims of facts about observed reality.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we established in the &lt;code&gt;Adric&lt;/code&gt; scenario, multiple facts for the same &lt;code&gt;E-A-V&lt;/code&gt; triple, can claim to have occurred at the same time (&lt;code&gt;Adric is NOT 17 as-of-now&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Adric IS 18 as-of-now&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consequently, though our bitemporal database notes down distinct facts at different times, we cannot presume that the sequence of recording follows Reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facts are mutually independent parallel claims that assert or redact some aspect of concurrent real-world events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, facts are always so. Variables are mutually dependent or independent; correlated or uncorrelated, because variables subsume Real identities, all of which live in the contiguous fabric of the same shared Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the Fact?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Materialised "Reality" depends on who's asking.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Reality" is a convenient fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We simulate alternate reality all the time. Worrying about the future. Worrying about what someone must be thinking about us just now. Questioning past life choices and wondering "what if". Much like financial analysts, weather modelers, chess pros, special ops teams running scenarios and doing retrospectives. Except those other people get paid to imagine worst case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;If each fact lives on its own conceptual timeline, then we must necessarily reconstruct reality by threading a point of view through a sequence of recorded facts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only the temporal sleuth‚Äînot the temporal database, nor engineer‚Äîget to choose which timeline or timelines (sequence(s) of facts) ought to construct a prospective Reality.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only the temporal sleuth gets to choose the &lt;code&gt;as-of&lt;/code&gt;point in time wherefrom to do so‚Äînow, past, future; separately or simultaneously. And gets paid to imagine alternate realities.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Architecture Decisions + Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nb.&lt;/code&gt; All code snippets are Clojure. All SQL is written specifically for SQLite, using the Honey SQL library (SQL as Clojure data structures).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Bet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All data systems are, in reality, temporal data systems. Most just don't know it until it's too late. Things‚Äîas life teaches inevitably‚Äîhave a habit of getting real, real fast. Suddenly, one fine day, life will deliver us a forehead-slapping moment because even that tiny-SaaS indie B2B app has manifested "a sufficiently complicated data system". Because complexity is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Architecture: A Vertically Integrated SaaS Machine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Runaway incidental complexity of software is why computers got slower while hardware and networks got faster. This bothers me no end. I want to profit from the glut of compute without taking on systemic complexity. 9&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way is to build software applications as unified vertically integrated computer systems, as a fruit-named company famously does. And, as is true for contemplating complected objects on hammocks, profiting from full-systems vertical integration isn't just for the absurdly rich global conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nb.&lt;/code&gt; "Vertical Integration" does NOT mean "Being Rigid". Quite the opposite; it means cultivate total adaptability, situational awareness, and mastery over self and environment. 10&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Trade-Off: Hard to design, Easy to Build-Own-Operate-Teach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main thing to understand is that changing any single detail of a vertically-integrated system could mandate ripple-effect changes through the whole system‚Ä¶ and that is okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The indie vertically-integrating systems builder should choose an extreme position:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Either go all-in on a single all-encompassing web SaaS stack (application framework, server runtime, tool chain).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Or make a custom system of composable parts. Entirely avoid building on top of pre-designed monolithic frameworks (most Clojure pros).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either way is fine. Either way demands significant investment from the committed indie SaaS builder. The only real choice one has, is to own it‚Äîlearn to fit self to it, or make it fit to self. 11&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Above All: Aggressively Minimise System-Wide Complexity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The absurdly not-rich local indie SaaS maker must accept the complexity-management limits of their own smol brain. And that is okay. One poor brain can do a lot, if it asks "So, like, how do I build a unified, coherent system specialised to me‚Äîmy goals, needs, and indeed, to my way of thinking?", which is‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no cloud services lock-in (no VC funding. no funding at all, actually.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no framework lock-in (a-la-carte pieces)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no tool-bench / process lock-in (design own tools shaped for own brain)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no devops clones (dead-simple deployments, observability, failover etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no (future) customer data lock-in (must be local-first compatible)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I am a grug-brained developer 12 therefore "the system" must be small conceptually, and literally. It is mission-critical to build the system piecemeal, where we intimately know the parts and can fully control interfaces between parts and abstraction boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the context of a SaaS web application it means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-server installation &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;App, db, cache, queue, document store, server, proxy; everything on one box&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;To scale, beef up server&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unified Application + Database architecture &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;In-process databases only&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Universal, static, zero-migration storage schema&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;All application-specific materialised views as application code i.e. the application is not "just a DB wrapper".&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Optionally, single tenancy. One DB per tenant, for regional compliance, and horizontal scaling as a nice side-benefit.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;No write concurrency. All database operations are one-way loops.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;No "Distributed Local-first". Local-first mode is unauthenticated single-user. Server-mode is bog standard synchronous SaaS.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immutability by default &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;idempotence where immutability gets too involved to implement correctly &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;in-place mutation only as a rare, purposeful, escape hatch when both immutability and idempotence get too complex or too resource-hungry&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;idempotence where immutability gets too involved to implement correctly &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One DB Engine to rule them all &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Primary store&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;K/V store&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sessions store&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cache&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Document store&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Two Wee VMs, please. One to serve, one for failover.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computers today‚Äîeven the cheap shared VMs‚Äîare stupid-fast. A properly built web app can use the smallest VM below, to support a healthy SaaS business, with room to grow. Add one more box on hot standby for failover.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Feed cheap disks to storage-hungry Temporal Databases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current Databases terrify the temporal database engineer. A current database is a giant mass of global mutable state. It has no innate sense of time. And current database engineers inevitably have to manage concurrency. Some even have to delve into the dark arts of Multi Version Concurrency Control. 14&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This mortal fear causes temporal database designers to copy accountants, who have been doing temporal data engineering for centuries. Why not tackle the far simpler problem of making everything append-only? Make a DB engine which will guarantee that at such-and-such time it faithfully recorded &amp;lt;this set of claimed facts&amp;gt;, as-given, nondestructively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, copying accountants isn't free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For one, temporal databases hoard data; chomping Terabytes for breakfast. The stuff of DB-tuning nightmares of current data engineers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For another, without the right tools, we risk being Disk-wise but Query-foolish. We mitigate this by copying architects (of software).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some worth copying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Clojure: Namespaces and Immutability are honking great ideas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to constrain all entities to well-known, guaranteed globally-qualified namespaces. So‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;world&lt;/code&gt;is the only global namespace we permit, and is also the only single-segmented namespace&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;all other namespaces must be minimum two-segmented, such as &lt;code&gt;com.acmecorp&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;com.acmecorp.foo-client&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ns_name&lt;/code&gt;must only ever be the namespace part (such as&lt;code&gt;com.acmecorp&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;world&lt;/code&gt;) of a fully qualified entity name (of&lt;code&gt;com.acmecorp/user&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;world/administrator&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, I might be able to drop HikariCP‚Ä¶ the spirit of "fewer dependencies, better life" is hard to ignore.

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Realities are arrows. Time marks flight. UUIDv7 is Time.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Processes are happening. Facts are being recorded. Events occur along a virtual timeline, not a physical one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of compositing a physical time and a virtual ID into one identifier, why not use a virtual time-is-a-vector style identifier and derive physical time from it for use in our normal day to day SQL queries, in addition to also having an identifier that is a standard requiring no coordination to create, is globally conflict-free, and is SQL DB indexing-friendly as well as query-friendly? In a world where disks are cheap, and data generation is unlimited, we can afford to waste computer resources on giant IDs instead of compact little Integers that overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UUIDv7 helps us express this concept. This is crucial for conflict management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our system relies on the guarantee that &lt;code&gt;valid_id&lt;/code&gt; is globally unique, even when the UNIX time component of &lt;code&gt;valid-id&lt;/code&gt; for multiple colliding facts is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default decision heuristic is "latest asserted fact wins". The "last write wins" principle is popularly used by the local-first community too (e.g. in CRDTs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, this thumb rule is not always acceptable. Humans will disagree about the facts for un-computable reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, different editors at the publisher Target may lay different claims to the same titular character name: claim conflicting values, and/or different asserted states. Now they have to duke it out and decide which assertion or redaction should apply for that EA pair at a given physical time.&lt;/p&gt;

And it should append a new &lt;code&gt;world_fact&lt;/code&gt;, stating for the record, that such-and-such &lt;code&gt;valid_id&lt;/code&gt; was set to &lt;code&gt;valid_preferred =

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HoneySQL: Current DB is just a VIEW of valid World Facts as-of-now&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HoneySQL: Current DB: Indices and Full Text Search for great good&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DDLs are elided because they are boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indices: Basically, we may create reverse indices of Facts, to support query patterns, as needed. Some possible indices for day-to-day "online" use, to be created on the "current world facts" view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EAV: Entity, Attribute, Value&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EAVTx: EAV, TransactionTime&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AEVTx&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AVETx&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VxAETx: ValidTime, AETx&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally, we wouldn't want to touch our lynchpin "World Facts" table. Indices consume disk space and that table will grow fast. The same indices might be required for retroactive "audit" use cases. Ideally I would do this sort of querying "offline", against a snapshot of the primary DB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Full Text Search, I intend to use SQLite's built-in 'FTS5' extension. It requires a bit of SQL writin'‚Äîmake a Virtual Table, and then write a bunch of Triggers to keep it up-to date. Again, very boring SQL, well documented at the extension's page. It just needs writing, is all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something like this‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;defn search-world-facts-as-of-now
 ("Run the given search query against the FTS table and
      return a match from the original world_facts table."

   ([where-search-clause-raw-sql]
    (search-world-facts-as-of-nowpartial format "fts_world_facts_as_of_now MATCH %s")
     (
     where-search-clause-raw-sql))
   ([search-term-formatter where-search-clause-raw-sql]
    (hsql/format:select [:world_facts.*]
     {:from [:fts_world_facts_as_of_now]
      :join [:world_facts
      
             [:=:fts_world_facts_as_of_now.rowid
              :world_facts.rowid]]
              :where [:raw (search-term-formatter
      
                    where-search-clause-raw-sql)]:order-by [:rank]}
      :inline true})))     {&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rama: Views are just data. Materialize in Clojure. Not in SQL.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The temporal database does not discriminate when storing facts. Consequently, any given temporal database could contain any of‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At least a partial snapshot of at least one Reality,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OR several partial snapshots of one Reality,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OR several partial snapshots of several, possibly alternate and parallel, Realities.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great power (and great responsibility) to decide the concretely materialised reality of the world resides solely in the hands of the party interrogating the temporal database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, the temporal database designer must create interrogation tools (query languages, data storage and access formats etc.) so the temporal data engineer can sift through a veritable multiverse, to figure out what "the world" looked like as of whatever time interests them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been warned that attempting temporal queries with SQL will cause obnoxious joins, strange indexing schemes, finicky triggers, stored procedures from hell, and non-standard shenanigans specific to the database engine in question. 15.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See James Henderson's "Building a Bitemporal Index" series‚Äîparts one, two, and three‚Äîto get a flavour of temporal query patterns that challenge current databases as well as current data engineers. Haunting questions like Why do you need to use a database with bitemporality baked in anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, if we play our cards right, this all-you-can-eat pedantic fact-recording can help us create truly general-purpose data systems. For example, Specter is a critical piece of Rama's query infrastructure, allowing the system to cheaply query materialised views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A lot of Rama programming revolves around materializing views (PStates), which are literally just data structures interacted with using the exact same Specter API as used to interact with in-memory data structures. This stands in stark contrast with databases, which have fixed data models and special APIs for interacting with them. Any database can be replicated in a PState in both expressivity and performance, since a data model is just a specific combination of data structures (e.g. key/value is a map, column-oriented is a map of sorted maps, document is a map of maps, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will embed all on-demand views in code, using plain ol' Clojure transducers and/or Specter's capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This endows our vertically integrated tiny-SaaS system with the Poor Man's cheap copy of Rama's task model of distributed programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Views always travel with the web application.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The database is always in-process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The data file itself is always machine-local.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each tenant gets their own dedicated SQLite database.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, it means that migrations occur NOT by futzing with database schemas, but by rolling out a new version of application code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, if the database architecture and schema never changes, and I don't screw up writing to it, then I should never ever need to run a schema migration. In the off-chance that I do need to physically migrate schema, I will be forced to do it in an append-only way, because that's how SQLite data migrations work the best and safest. Which is a good corner to box oneself into, because it forces us to do nondestructive migrations, be they of schema or of data. This makes gradual roll-outs and complete roll-backs fairly safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite has one more compelling feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SQLite: Flexible typing for the win&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without this, the Facts table would be rather ungainly. With flexible typing, our 'numeric' values are stored as efficiently as they can be stored. Numbers are stored as numbers. Text is stored as text. Booleans are stored as booleans. In the very same column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it does not protect us the way Datomic, XTDB, and Rama do. We have to make our own guardrails to safely use SQLite as if it were a temporal database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Emulate immutability for the most part (append-only facts).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use Idempotence (upsert entities -&amp;gt; facts)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Facts must include all actions happening within the world, including addition, removal, updates to namespaces, users, entities, fact meta-data, and set-preferred-fact choices.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something like this‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Transact Facts: Append-only&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;defn append-facts!

   ([tx facts]nil))

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Transact Entities, Namespaces, Users Idempotently&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And append corresponding facts in the world-facts table too. Yes, it doubles up as an audit log for things that were done to the World itself, in addition to things happened inside the World.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One more cool thing about SQLite is that it can totally be used as our "Everything DB Engine" (see: oldmoe/litestack), with purpose-specific database files (queue, cache, sessions, documents, key-value store). SQLite's ability to do cross-database joins will doubtless come handy too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Git and Local-First: Somehow make all facts merge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fact is a snapshot of an event in time. If we are careful to send facts around so that they are trivial to merge in a facts table, then we can separate out conflict management. Git shows the way. When we fetch changes, the objects are synced to our computer. If a conflict occurs, then what happens to the objects? They remain cached on disk. Git simply refuses to transact the conflict into the live state of the codebase, until someone a) fixes the conflict manually and b) tells git that the conflict is resolved. Git does not know or care about the conflict resolution mechanism. This is because conflicts occur due to essential tacit and implicit context that never travels with the objects. Disambiguation thus requires converging on shared agreement, which is a squishy non-deterministic process at best, chaotic and interminable at worst. Have you heard of laws and lawmakers?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;world_facts&lt;/code&gt;table is going to grow very fast. Measure latency at various orders of magnitude, for the same example domain complexity, for the same line-of-business read/write pattern (SaaS-y 80% read, 20% write, for example).&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;1 M facts&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;10 M facts&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;100 M facts&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;1000 M facts&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;etc‚Ä¶&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, try to find out all the ways this will fail to satisfy the "can I get away with it" criterion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Postamble / Rant As A Recap (same thing)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A gaggle of reasons 16 diverted me onto this long road to a small mangy database 17.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;wannabe be an Independent Software Vendor,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;specialised in building niche SaaS products,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;operating on dirt-cheap server infrastructure,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;with super-duper low maintenance overhead,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;while being able to extend the SaaS to local-first usage 18&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a consequence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most crucially, I must design and build a system that I can hold in my head and explain to anyone. It is a form of buyer investment protection. If any business buys my software, they must have assurance that not just their data, but the whole application will be accessible to any other competent party they wish to transfer operations and upkeep to. It's one thing to transfer software and data custody, but a whole other ballgame to transfer ownership.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All SaaS building blocks must be compact, stable, and composable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rework must be designed out.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following have been sloshing about my skull, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SQLite for web backends&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local First software and private data sovereignty&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Entity-Attribute-Value modeling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bitemporal data systems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The meaning of time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A healthy avoidance of schema migrations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immutability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Idempotence (often the next-best thing to immutability, and sometimes even better)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Concurrency (especially concurrent read/write independence)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the road, the specific choice of trying this in SQLite boils down to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Necessary Frugality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Necessary Archival&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unnecessarily Having a Smol Grug Brain&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unnecessarily Caring Too Much&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unnecessarily Poor Impulse Control&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end customers, in this particular case, survive largely on love and fresh air and the mercurial generosity of arts-supporting sponsors. But that fact is valid for any indie web app I make too. So the SaaS-es must be dirt-cheap to run. And I should be able to trivially power them up and down and up again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complete database exports must be made available, on-demand, in a universally query-able, archive-grade format. The database itself must be archive-grade. Only SQLite publicly guarantees availability till 2050. And they are one of a few formats approved by the US Library of Congress for data archival.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because though We are one, and We are little, and We live like an artist, We care about sovereign data ownership a bit too much, especially when the Sovereign is the poor NPC at the bottom of the B2B food chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It must be trivial to store each customer's data in the appropriate geography. And to offer it for download on demand. And to forget it completely, when asked. And to be able to prove that we've done so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, we can't use automagic managed services, because that means deep vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last but not least, The Whole Thing Must be Single Operator Friendly Especially If Said Operator Will Necessarily Have To Operate Internationally, Meaning They Can Easily Run Afoul Of Data Residency and Privacy Laws That They Cannot Humanly Know Or Keep Abreast Of. Like Ever . 19&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" is a paper by American philosopher Thomas Nagel, first published in The Philosophical Review in October 1974, and later in Nagel's Mortal Questions (1979). The paper presents several difficulties posed by phenomenal consciousness, including the potential insolubility of the mind‚Äìbody problem owing to "facts beyond the reach of human concepts", the limits of objectivity and reductionism, the "phenomenological features" of subjective experience, the limits of human imagination, and what it means to be a particular, conscious thing.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagel asserts that "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism‚Äîsomething it is like for the organism."[2] This assertion has achieved special status in consciousness studies as "the standard 'what it's like' locution".[3] Daniel Dennett, while sharply disagreeing on some points, acknowledged Nagel's paper as "the most widely cited and influential thought experiment about consciousness".[4]: 441 Nagel argues you cannot compare human consciousness to that of a bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thesis&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Nagel challenges the possibility of explaining "the most important and characteristic feature of conscious mental phenomena" by reductive materialism (the philosophical position that all statements about the mind and mental states can be translated, without any loss or change in meaning, into statements about the physical). For example, a reductive physicalist's solution to the mind‚Äìbody problem holds that whatever "consciousness" is, it can be fully described via physical processes in the brain and body.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagel begins by assuming that "conscious experience is a widespread phenomenon" present in many animals (particularly mammals), even though it is "difficult to say [...] what provides evidence of it". Thus, Nagel sees consciousness not as something exclusively human, but as something shared by many, if not all, organisms. Nagel must be speaking of something other than sensory perception, since objective facts and widespread evidence show that organisms with sensory organs have biological processes of sensory perception. In fact, what all organisms share, according to Nagel, is what he calls the "subjective character of experience" defined as follows: "An organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism ‚Äì something that it is like for the organism."[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper argues that the subjective nature of consciousness undermines any attempt to explain consciousness via objective, reductionist means. The subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a system of functional or intentional states. Consciousness cannot be fully explained if the subjective character of experience is ignored, and the subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a reductionist; it is a mental phenomenon that cannot be reduced to materialism.[6] Thus, for consciousness to be explained from a reductionist stance, the idea of the subjective character of experience would have to be discarded, which is absurd. Neither can a physicalist view, because in such a world, each phenomenal experience had by a conscious being would have to have a physical property attributed to it, which is impossible to prove due to the subjectivity of conscious experience. Nagel argues that each and every subjective experience is connected with a "single point of view", making it infeasible to consider any conscious experience as "objective".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagel uses the example of bats to clarify the distinction between subjective and objective concepts. Because bats are mammals, they are assumed to have conscious experience. Nagel was inspired to use a bat for his argument after living in a home where the animals were frequent visitors. Nagel ultimately used bats for his argument because of their highly evolved and active use of a biological sensory apparatus that is significantly different from that of many other organisms. Bats use echolocation to navigate and perceive objects. This method of perception is similar to the human sense of vision. Both sonar and vision are regarded as perceptual experiences. While it is possible to imagine what it would be like to fly, navigate by sonar, hang upside down and eat insects like a bat, that is not the same as a bat's perspective. Nagel claims that even if humans were able to metamorphose gradually into bats, their brains would not have been wired as a bat's from birth; therefore, they would only be able to experience the life and behaviors of a bat, rather than the mindset.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such is the difference between subjective and objective points of view. According to Nagel, "our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience", meaning that each individual only knows what it is like to be them (subjectivism). Objectivity requires an unbiased, non-subjective state of perception. For Nagel, the objective perspective is not feasible, because humans are limited to subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagel concludes with the contention that it would be wrong to assume that physicalism is incorrect, since that position is also imperfectly understood. Physicalism claims that states and events are physical, but those physical states and events are only imperfectly characterized. Nevertheless, he holds that physicalism cannot be understood without characterizing objective and subjective experience. That is a necessary precondition for understanding the mind‚Äìbody problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Criticisms&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Daniel Dennett denied Nagel's claim that the bat's consciousness is inaccessible, contending that any "interesting or theoretically important" features of a bat's consciousness would be amenable to third-person observation.[4]: 442 For instance, it is clear that bats cannot detect objects more than a few meters away because echolocation has a limited range. Dennett holds that any similar aspects of its experiences could be gleaned by further scientific experiments.[4]: 443 He has also pointed out[8] that Nagel's argument and question were not new, but had previously been stated by B. A. Farrell in his 1950 article "Experience", published in the journal Mind.[9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Akins similarly argued that many questions about a bat's subjective experience hinge on unanswered questions about the neuroscientific details of a bat's brain (such as the function of cortical activity profiles), and Nagel is too quick in ruling these out as answers to his central question.[10][11]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Hacker analyzes Nagel's statement as not only "malconstructed" but philosophically "misconceived" as a definition of consciousness,[12] and he asserts that Nagel's paper "laid the groundwork for ... forty years of fresh confusion about consciousness".[13]: 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Schwitzgebel and Michael S. Gordon have argued that, contrary to Nagel, normal sighted humans do use echolocation much like bats ‚Äì it is just that it is generally done without one's awareness. They use this to argue that normal people in normal circumstances can be grossly and systematically mistaken about their conscious experience.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ a b Nagel, Thomas (10 March 2005).

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6NF File Format is a new bitemporal, sixth-normal-form (6NF)-inspired data exchange format designed for DWH and for reporting. It replaces complex hierarchical formats like XBRL, XML, JSON, and YAML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;2. Design Principles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Database Friendly Flat Structure: No nested objects or arrays. No need for parsing&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;6NF Compatibility: Direct mapping to 6NF database tables. No need for normalization&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bitemporal Database Compatibility: All data includes valid_from and recorded_at timestamps&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;UTC Time Standard: All timestamps must be in UTC format, denoted by the 'Z' suffix (e.g., 2023-01-01T12:00:00Z)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Struct Grouping: Multiple attributes with shared temporal context&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compactness: Uses Crockford‚Äôs Base32 - encoded UUIDv7 for identifiers&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Readability: Clean syntax with minimal punctuation&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL Style: Uses snake_case notation of identifiers (names)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Case Sensitivity: Keywords are UPPERCASE and case-sensitive. Identifiers (names) are lowercase and case-sensitive&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;UTF-8 Encoding: Files use UTF-8 encoding&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;We're Joining OpenAI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm excited to announce that we're joining OpenAI‚Äôs Codex team!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we started out, Xcode had no AI. Building a "Cursor for Xcode" sounded crazy, but we managed to do it anyway. And, over time, we built the best coding agent for iOS &amp;amp; MacOS apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm extremely proud of what we accomplished with Alex. Seeing people build software with our work was surreal. It is an honor to continue that work at a much bigger scale at OpenAI, along with the incredibly talented Codex team. Our mission is to help people create, and today that is more possible than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens to Alex:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We plan to continue service for existing users, but will stop new downloads of the app on October 1st. As long as you have the app installed, our plan is to continue serving you. But there won‚Äôt be any new features released.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you all -- our day 1 beta users, our customers, our amazing investors, and the entire Apple Dev community for helping us Make Something Wonderful ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(P.S. Check out Codex CLI!)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Tufte CSS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dave Liepmann&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte‚Äôs books and handouts. Tufte‚Äôs style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tufte CSS was created by Dave Liepmann and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from Tufte-LaTeX and R Markdown‚Äôs Tufte Handout format. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: tufte-css. Please note the contribution guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say ‚Äúwebsites should look like this interpretation of Tufte‚Äôs books‚Äù but rather ‚Äúhere are some techniques Tufte developed that we‚Äôve found useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web‚Äù. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use Tufte CSS, copy &lt;code&gt;tufte.css&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;et-book&lt;/code&gt; directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; block:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sections and Headings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organize your document with an &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt; element inside your &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; tag. Inside that, use &lt;code&gt;section&lt;/code&gt; tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tufte CSS uses &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; for the document title, &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; with class &lt;code&gt;subtitle&lt;/code&gt; for the document subtitle, &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; for section headings, and &lt;code&gt;h3&lt;/code&gt; for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of sentences which then cumulate sequentially into paragraphs, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn‚Äôt require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using &lt;code&gt;blockquote&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;footer&lt;/code&gt; elements. See page 20 of The Visual Display of Quantitative Information for an example in print.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his later booksBeautiful Evidence, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the class &lt;code&gt;newthought&lt;/code&gt;, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately through &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. Be consistent: though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the &lt;code&gt;newthought&lt;/code&gt; technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Text&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS uses &lt;code&gt;#fffff8&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#111111&lt;/code&gt; because they are nearly indistinguishable from their ‚Äòpure‚Äô cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype BemboSee Tufte‚Äôs comment in the Tufte book fonts thread. font. A similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source ETBook, which Tufte CSS supplies with a &lt;code&gt;@font-face&lt;/code&gt; reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn‚Äôt work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you prefer sans-serifs, use the &lt;code&gt;sans&lt;/code&gt; class. It relies on Gill Sans, Tufte‚Äôs sans-serif font of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a dummy example that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text. Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides by default. Other approaches can also be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Epigraphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôd like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte‚Äôs books (particularly Beautiful Evidence), these are &lt;code&gt;blockquote&lt;/code&gt; elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a &lt;code&gt;footer&lt;/code&gt; element inside the &lt;code&gt;blockquote&lt;/code&gt;. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most distinctive features of Tufte‚Äôs style is his extensive use of sidenotes.This is a sidenote. Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don‚Äôt force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations as close as possible to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must manually assign a reference &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; to each side or margin note, replacing ‚Äúsn-demo‚Äù in the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like &lt;code&gt;sn-&lt;/code&gt; for sidenotes and &lt;code&gt;mn-&lt;/code&gt; for margin notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; with class &lt;code&gt;sidenote&lt;/code&gt;. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For optimal readibility of sidenotes, enclose the main text in the &lt;code&gt;section&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note. This is a margin note. Notice there isn‚Äôt a number preceding the note. On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ‚äï (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8853;&lt;/code&gt;), but it‚Äôs up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the &lt;code&gt;marginnote&lt;/code&gt; class for the content and the &lt;code&gt;margin-toggle&lt;/code&gt; class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8853;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;span class="marginnote"&amp;gt;
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn‚Äôt a number preceding the note.
&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figures in the margin are created as margin notes, as demonstrated in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Figures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs, and figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On the web, that means readability of graphics and their accompanying text without extra clicks, tab-switching, or scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figures should try to use the &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; element, which by default are constrained to the main column. Don‚Äôt wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular margin note inside the figure. For example, most of the time one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of discussion, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;F.J. Cole, ‚ÄúThe History of Albrecht D√ºrer‚Äôs Rhinoceros in Zooological Literature,‚Äù Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte‚Äôs Visual Explanations. But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte‚Äôs work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag, as seen to the right of this paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need a full-width figure, give it the &lt;code&gt;fullwidth&lt;/code&gt; class. Make sure that‚Äôs inside an &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt;, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte‚Äôs English translation of the Napoleon‚Äôs March data visualization. From Beautiful Evidence, page 122-124.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One obstacle to creating elegant figures on the web is the difficulty of handling different screen sizes, especially on the fly. Embedded &lt;code&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt; elements are particularly troublesome. For these instances we provide a helper class, &lt;code&gt;iframe-wrapper&lt;/code&gt;, the most common use for which is probably YouTube videos, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;figure class="iframe-wrapper"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YslQ2625TR4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use this class on a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt;, with slightly different results but the same general effect. Experiment and choose depending on your application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical jargon, programming language terms, and code samples are denoted with the &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; class, as I‚Äôve been using in this document to denote HTML. Code needs to be monospace for formatting purposes and to aid in code analysis, but it must maintain its readability. To those ends, Tufte CSS follows GitHub‚Äôs font selection, which shifts gracefully along the monospace spectrum from the elegant but rare Consolas all the way to good old reliable Courier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extended code examples should live in a &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; element within a &lt;code&gt;pre&lt;/code&gt; element. This adds control over indentation and overflow as well:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ImageQuilts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tufte CSS provides support for Edward Tufte and Adam Schwartz‚Äôs ImageQuilts. See the ET forum announcement thread for more on quilts. Some have ragged edges, others straight. Include these images just as you would any other &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an ImageQuilt surveying Chinese calligraphy, placed in a full-width figure to accomodate its girth:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is an ImageQuilt of 47 animal sounds over and over, in a figure constrained to the main text region. This quilt has ragged edges, but the image itself is of course still rectangular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many thanks go to Edward Tufte for leading the way with his work. It is only through his kind and careful editing that this project accomplishes what it does. All errors of implementation are of course mine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build faster. Waste less time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depot is growing rapidly and reinventing the software build space, so we are now looking for our first dedicated Solutions Engineer to bridge the gap between our innovative technology and the developers who need it most. This is a rare opportunity for an experienced developer who wants to help peers make dramatic gains in their day-to-day jobs, and ultimately for their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; An ideal candidate would be someone who is already a Depot user and fan who wants to find a new role in a fast-growing, venture-backed startup. There is no template for this role, so it requires a self-starter to shape how we support and grow our customer base, working directly with engineering teams at fast-growing companies to solve their most critical build performance challenges.&lt;lb/&gt; To support our rapidly growing customer base, we are looking for Solutions Engineers based in the US or Canada.&lt;lb/&gt; Depot has created a build performance and developer productivity platform unlike any other. We've turned what it means to build software locally and in CI upside down by making performance a top-level feature rather than an afterthought. Our platform accelerates existing tools and services like Docker builds and GitHub Actions, saving Depot customers all over the world literal years in build time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; This role's success will be driven by providing deeply technical guidance that helps customers extract maximum value from Depot while identifying opportunities for where we can further help. You'll be the technical voice that turns curious developers into Depot advocates and helps existing customers unlock exponential build performance improvements.&lt;lb/&gt; If you're passionate about developer tools and want to directly impact how software is built, we'd like to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Technical Background&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Culture and Work&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are a fully remote and globally distributed team across the US, Europe, and Canada currently. As a remote startup, there is a collection of things we value and expect from folks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depot is a build acceleration and developer productivity platform that saves companies like PostHog, Wistia, Semgrep, and Secoda thousands of hours in build time every week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are developers. We started Depot because we were frustrated with the constant pain of slow build performance. We were fed up waiting for builds and annoyed by the lack of tooling and providers that actually made builds performant. So, we went and built the solution we had always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slow builds are the dam standing in the way between mediocrity and innovation. They‚Äôre wasteful, expensive, and a drain on developer happiness &amp;amp; productivity. They slow down innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking a 40-minute build down to a minute, changes everything. We help folks save literal years in build time every single week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we‚Äôre just getting started. For us, it‚Äôs all about iteration speed and keeping developers in their flow state. Our mission is to be relentless in accelerating software development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Evidence That AI Is Destroying Jobs For Young People Just Got Stronger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A big nerd debate with bigger implications for the future of work, technology, and the economy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a moment with many important economic questions and fears, I continue to find this among the more interesting mysteries about the US economy in the long run: Is artificial intelligence already taking jobs from young people?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôve been casually following the debate over AI and its effect on young graduates‚Äô employment, you could be excused for thinking that the answer to that question is ‚Äúpossibly,‚Äù or ‚Äúdefinitely yes,‚Äù or ‚Äúalmost certainly no.‚Äù Confusing! Let‚Äôs review:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Possibly! In April, I published an essay in The Atlantic that raised the possibility that weak hiring among young college graduates might indicate an AI disruption. My observation started with an objective fact: The New York Federal Reserve found that work opportunities for recent college graduates had ‚Äúdeteriorated noticeably‚Äù in the previous few months. Among several explanations, including tight monetary policy and general Trumpy chaos, I considered the explanation that companies might be using ChatGPT to do the work they‚Äôd historically relied on from young college grads. As David Deming, an economist and the dean of undergraduate studies at Harvard University, told me: ‚ÄúWhen you think from first principles about what generative AI can do, and what jobs it can replace, it‚Äôs the kind of things that young college grads have done‚Äù in white-collar firms.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Definitely yes! Soon after my essay went up, several other major news organizations and AI luminaries endorsed even stronger versions of my hedged claim. The New York Times said that for some recent graduates ‚Äúthe A.I. job apocalypse may already be here.‚Äù Axios reported that ‚ÄúAI is keeping recent college grads out of work.‚Äù In a much-discussed interview predicting a labor ‚Äúbloodbath,‚Äù Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made the audacious forecast that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years. By June, the narrative that AI was on the verge of obliterating the college-grad workforce was in full bloom. Until ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Almost certainly no!: As AI panic reached its fever pitch, several whip-smart analysts called the whole premise into question. A report from the Economic Innovation Group took several cuts of government data and found ‚Äúlittle evidence of AI‚Äôs impact on unemployment,‚Äù and even less evidence that ‚ÄúAI-exposed workers [were] retreating to occupations with less exposure.‚Äù In fact, they pointed out that ‚Äúthe vast majority of firms report that AI had no net impact on their employment.‚Äù John Burn-Murdoch at the Financial Times pointed out that ‚Äúthe much-discussed contraction in entry-level tech hiring appears to have reversed in recent months.‚Äù The economic commentator Noah Smith synthesized even more research on this question to reach the conclusion that ‚Äúthe preponderance of evidence seems to be very strongly against the notion that AI is killing jobs for new college graduates, or for tech workers, or for‚Ä¶well, anyone, really.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be honest with you, I considered this debate well and truly settled. No, I‚Äôd come to think, AI is probably not wrecking employment for young people. But now, I‚Äôm thinking about changing my mind again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, I got an email from Stanford University alerting me to yet another crack at this question. In a new paper, several Stanford economists studied payroll data from the private company ADP, which covers millions of workers, through mid-2025. They found that young workers aged 22‚Äì25 in ‚Äúhighly AI-exposed‚Äù jobs, such as software developers and customer service agents, experienced a 13 percent decline in employment since the advent of ChatGPT. Notably, the economists found that older workers and less-exposed jobs, such as home health aides, saw steady or rising employment. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a clear, evident change when you specifically look at young workers who are highly exposed to AI,‚Äù Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson, who wrote the paper with Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen, told the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In five months, the question of ‚ÄúIs AI reducing work for young Americans?‚Äù has its fourth answer: from possibly, to definitely, to almost certainly no, to plausibly yes. You might find this back-and-forth annoying. I think it‚Äôs fantastic. This is a model for what I want from public commentary on social and economic trends: Smart, quantitatively rich, and good-faith debate of issues of seismic consequence to American society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To more deeply understand the new Stanford paper, I reached out and scheduled an interview with two co-authors, Erik Brynjolfsson and Bharat Chandar. A condensed and edited version of our interview is below, along with careful analysis of the most important graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson: What‚Äôs the most important thing this paper is trying to do, and what‚Äôs the most important thing it finds?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Erik Brynjolfsson: There has been a lot of debate out there about AI and jobs for young people. I was hearing companies telling me one thing while studies were telling me another. I honestly didn't know the answer. We went at this with no agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we were able to slice the data, lo and behold, subcategories of high-exposed jobs like software developers and customer service agents for people aged 22 to 25 saw a very striking decline in employment in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we asked, what else could this be? We brainstormed alternative hypotheses‚ÄîCOVID and remote work, tech over-hiring and pullback, interest rates‚Äîand we put in efforts to address and control for all of those, and the results still showed through clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a causal test, to be clear. We didn‚Äôt assign the technology to some firms and not others. But it‚Äôs a comprehensive observational analysis that controls for all the obvious alternatives we could think of. We‚Äôre happy to add more if people suggest them. Right now, there‚Äôs a clear correlation between the most-exposed categories and falling employment for young people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson: People like to look at graphs, and this will be published as a Q&amp;amp;A on Substack, so why don‚Äôt you tell me the key graphs from your paper that make the strongest case for your finding?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bharat Chandar: I think Figure 1 has drawn a lot of interest, which considers the employment effects among young software engineers/software developers and customer service. We clearly saw hiring decline for young workers specifically, in these occupations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I think people have been pretty interested in Figure 2 on the effects for home health aides as well, because here you see the opposite pattern. This is an occupation you wouldn‚Äôt think is very exposed to AI, because a lot of the work is in person and physical. And, indeed, you see the opposite pattern. For entry-level worker, there is faster employment growth. So that suggests this isn‚Äôt an economy-wide trend. The decline in employment really seems to be more concentrated in jobs that are more AI-exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson: Other research failed to find any effect of AI on employment for young people. Why is your paper different?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chandar: The main advantage we have is this data from ADP, which tracks millions of workers every single month. That allows us to dig into what‚Äôs happening with much more precision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually wrote a paper a couple of months ago using data from the Current Population Survey [CPS], which is a kind of workforce survey for real-time economic outcomes that researchers rely on a lot. My conclusion was similar to pieces by John Burn-Murdoch and others: Across the entire economy, we weren‚Äôt seeing major disruptions in the jobs most exposed to AI. But the tricky thing [with CPS] is that when you narrow your analysis to, say, software engineers aged 22 to 25, the sample sizes get very small. You don‚Äôt have the precision to say much that‚Äôs definitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs where the ADP data comes in. With millions of observations every month, we can cut the data by age and occupation and get reliable estimates even for small groups like 22‚Äì25 year-old software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson: One piece of the paper that I love is that you specify the effect of AI in occupations where AI is more likely to automate vs. augment human work. So, "translate this essay into Spanish" or "format this technical document" is a task that can be automated by existing AI. But drafting a marketing strategy for a company is something where a human worker is necessary and might collaborate with AI. How did this distinction between automation versus augmentation play out in the paper?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chandar: We have different measures of AI exposure. One we use is from Claude, via the Anthropic Economic Index. They analyze conversations that come into Claude and associate them with tasks and occupations. For each occupation, they give a sense of whether usage is more automative or augmentative. Automative means my conversation with AI is completely replacing some work I‚Äôd have to do. Augmentative is more like I‚Äôm learning by using Claude, asking questions, gaining knowledge, getting validation and feedback. We got an interesting result. For occupations where usage is more automative, we see substantial declines in employment for young people, whereas for augmentative occupations, that‚Äôs not true. You can see this in Figures 6 and 7 in the paper. It‚Äôs compelling because it shows not all LLM usage results in the same trend. The effect shows up more in the automative uses than the augmentative uses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson: What kind of jobs are most automative versus augmentative?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chandar: For automative occupations, a lot of it is software engineering, auditing, and accounting, where there are well-defined workflows and LLMs are good at doing one-off tasks without a lot of feedback. For augmentative cases, you‚Äôre looking at more complex or managerial roles. It‚Äôs not, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just offloading my task and I‚Äôm set.‚Äù There‚Äôs more back-and-forth, more strategic thinking on top of using the LLM. For those applications, we don‚Äôt see the same patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson: Would it be fair to say that within the same company, access to generative AI tools could reduce employment among young workers in one department‚Äîsay, the legal department, where young hires just read, and look up stuff, and synthesize what they find, and write up reports‚Äîbut also increase employment in another department, where the technology is more augmentative? So ‚ÄúAI is killing jobs at Company X‚Äù is less accurate than ‚ÄúAI is reducing headcount in Department A and increasing it in Department B.‚Äù Is that the story?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chandar: Exactly. We actually have an analysis that confirms almost exactly that. It‚Äôs a little technical, but it‚Äôs basically what you just said. In one part of the analysis, we control for the firm and find that even within the same company, the more-exposed jobs are declining relative to the less-exposed jobs. In particular, for the most-exposed jobs, there‚Äôs a 13% relative decline in employment compared to the least-exposed jobs. That‚Äôs compelling because these aren‚Äôt trends driven by firm-level, aggregate economic shocks, like interest-rate changes. You‚Äôd expect those to apply at the firm level, but even within the firm you see differences between the more-exposed jobs and the less-exposed jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson: What does this suggest about what AI is good at versus what workers are good at?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brynjolfsson: This is a little speculative, but important. LLMs learn from what‚Äôs written down and codified, like books, articles, Reddit, the internet. There‚Äôs overlap between what young workers learn in classrooms, like at Stanford, and what LLMs can replicate. Senior workers rely more on tacit knowledge, which is the tips and tricks of the trade that aren‚Äôt written down. It appears what younger workers know overlaps more with what LLMs can replace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chandar: One thing I‚Äôd add is short-time-horizon tasks vs. long-time-horizon tasks. The strategic thinking that goes into longer-horizon tasks may be something LLMs aren‚Äôt as good at, which aligns with why entry-level workers are more affected than experienced workers. Another factor is observable outcomes. Tasks where it‚Äôs easy to see whether you did a good job may be more substitutable. tThe nature of the training process means AI should, in general, be better at those.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson: Does this paper have any bearing on the question of how colleges should respond to AI or what should students should study?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brynjolfsson: One obvious category is: learn how to use AI. Paradoxically, I‚Äôve found that senior coders are more familiar with AI than juniors. Universities haven‚Äôt updated their curricula. Maybe universities need to explicitly teach not just the principles of coding but also how to use these tools the way people do on the job. Also, there are many things LLMs aren‚Äôt very good at. Many jobs have a physical component that may be increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what did we learn today? I think Noah Smith‚Äôs basic approach here is correct. Understanding real-time changes to the economy is hard work, and overconfidence in any direction is unadvisable. But I‚Äôm updating in the direction of trusting my initial gut instinct. I think we‚Äôre looking at the single most compelling evidence that AI is already affecting the labor force for young people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This fits into a broader theme that I‚Äôm trying to bang on about in my work on AI. All this talk about AI as the technology of the future‚Äîwill it cure cancer in 2030? or, destroy the world in 2027? or accomplish both, maybe within the same month?‚Äîcan evade the question of what AI is doing to the economy right now. AI infrastructure spending growth is already keeping annual GDP growth above water. AI is already creating a cheating crisis in high schools and colleges. AI is having interactions with young and anxious people that are already having real-world effects. And, just maybe, AI is already warping the labor market for young people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone once asked me recently if I had any advice on how to predict the future when I wrote about social and technological trends. Sure, I said. My advice is that predicting the future is impossible, so the best thing you can do is try to describe the present accurately. Since most people live in the past, hanging onto stale narratives and outdated models, people who pay attention to what‚Äôs happening as it happens will appear to others like they‚Äôre predicting the future when all they‚Äôre doing is describing the present. When it comes to the AI-employment debate, I expect we‚Äôll see many more turns of this wheel. I cannot promise you that I‚Äôll be able to predict the future of artificial intellignece. But I can promise you that I‚Äôll do my best to describe the wheel as it turns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;‚ÄúModels constantly change and improve but evals persist‚Äù&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Look at the data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No amount of evals will replace the need to look at the data, once you have a evals good coverage you‚Äôll be able to decrease the time but it‚Äôll be always a must to just look at the agent traces to identify possible issues or things to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Starting, end to end evals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must create evals for your agents, stop relying solely on manual testing.&lt;lb/&gt;Not sure where to start?&lt;lb/&gt;Add e2e evals, define a success criteria (did the agent meet the user‚Äôs goal?) and make the evals output a simple yes/no value.&lt;lb/&gt;This is much better than no evals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By performing simple end to end agent evaluations you can quickly manage to:&lt;lb/&gt;‚Äì identify problematic edge cases&lt;lb/&gt;‚Äì update, trim and refine the agent prompts&lt;lb/&gt;‚Äì make sure you are not breaking the already working cases&lt;lb/&gt;‚Äì compare the performance of the current llm model vs. cheaper ones&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;N -1 evals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you created the e2e evals you can move on with ‚ÄúN ‚Äì 1‚Äù evals, that is, evals that need to ‚Äúsimulate‚Äù previous interactions between system and user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose that either by looking at the data or by running a set of e2e evals you find that there is a problem when the user asks for the brand open stores in his area. Well, it‚Äôd be better to create an eval to directly improve this, but if you keep doing it with the e2e evals you won‚Äôt be able to always reproduce the error and your evals will take too much time and will cost too much money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôd be much better to ‚Äúsimulate‚Äù the previous interactions and then get to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs one issue with this, you‚Äôll have to be careful to keep the ‚ÄúN ‚Äì 1‚Äù interactions updated whenever you make some changes because you will be ‚Äúsimulating‚Äù something that will never happen again in your agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Checkpoints&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs really difficult and time intensive to evaluate agents outputs when you are trying to validate complex conversation patterns that you want the LLM‚Äôs to strictly follow.&lt;lb/&gt;I usually put ‚Äúcheckpoints‚Äù inside the prompts, words that I ask the llm to output verbatim.&lt;lb/&gt;This allows me to simply make some evals that check for exact strings. If at some point of the conversation the string is not present, I can pretty much know that the system is not working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;External tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools can help you by simplifying the setup/infra and maybe giving you a nice interface, but you still have to look at the data and build the specific evaluations for your use case.&lt;lb/&gt;Don‚Äôt rely solely on standard evals, build your own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I saw another article whiz by a few days ago from a journalist claiming that she only used cash again, and what a boon it had been for her. She‚Äôs hardly an isolated case; I‚Äôm especially seeing Zoomers in my circles go back to cash in a big way, for what are positive and heartening reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You would think someone in my position would relate. I‚Äôm trying to reduce my smartphone dependence by offloading as much as I can from its black rectangular confides. I use a mirrorless camera, I read physical books, I make notes with a little pen. While I have Apple Pay set up as an emergency fallback, I don‚Äôt use it in my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm also wary of online tracking and digital surveillance, to which my years of blogging on the subjects here can attest. I always get a chuckle from people saying you shouldn‚Äôt use loyalty cards in grocery stores and the like‚Ä¶ when they pay with credit cards! Our spending habits are ripe for data mining, selling, or worse; to say nothing about the potential financial pitfalls and predatory nature of credit card companies that can snare you. You either use credit cards, or credit cards use you, as my dear late friend Jim Kloss used to say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there are the benefits cash confers. It‚Äôs (mostly) anonymous. It doesn‚Äôt come with hidden charges or card access fees that accumulate over time. It isn‚Äôt dependent on a merchant remembering to charge their EFTPOS terminal overnight, or having a reliable power source in the first place. It‚Äôs not affected by inevitable technical outages at a payment processor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most critically, cash can be more accessible. You don‚Äôt need a bank account, or a smartphone, or have undergone credit checks to use cash. This is why I‚Äôve talked before about ‚Äúcashless‚Äù societies being a worry, because as is frustratingly typical, we risk disenfranchising our most vulnerable and powerless neighbours without designing, testing, and implementing these systems carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why do I continue using cards? For the same reason you probably do: convenience. I can tap a card, and have paid for something. I don‚Äôt need to futz around in my wallet or scramble to count the exact change, lest my pockets swell with jingling, ever-increasing numbers of low denomination metal scraps (though self-serve supermarket checkouts are great for pouring in coins at the end of the week). Australian coins are massive, especially our 50 c piece which can double as a drain cover, discus, or dinner plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cards are also wildly convenient for budgeting, perhaps most importantly to me. Clara and I reconcile down to the cent every week, and it‚Äôs an order of magnitude easier running down a list of transactions on a card than flipping through receipts that may have been crumbled, lost, or not given in the first place. I consider this such a vital feature that I consider card surcharges an acceptable trade-off. I‚Äôve had to budget funds into the ‚ÄúBarrier‚Äù digital budget envelope when I‚Äôve used cash to make the numbers reconcile. I‚Äôve never had to with card transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cash is also‚ÄîI regret to say‚Äîdisgusting. I‚Äôve been in enough public restrooms around the world to know roughly 100% of the population either aren‚Äôt bothered to wash their hands properly, or don‚Äôt know how (I would have hoped our global Covid adventure would have helped address this social shortcoming‚Ä¶ nope). I‚Äôm also still scarred by a high school experiment where we left currency in Petri dishes, and came back on Monday to what could best be described as a horrendous sight. Coins give my hands that stale metal smell, and being handed grimy cash is not something I enjoy. Maybe this doesn‚Äôt bother you, which is great! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre perturbed by something else with which I‚Äôm fine. That‚Äôs how the world works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The galaxy brain thought here is that cash is entirely a social construct we could do without; hence why I don‚Äôt love it. But it‚Äôs easier for me to use a card if I have to engage. Feel free to use money as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

"pack/*/start" and "pack/*/opt", you could put them anywhere.  We recommend
you put them below "pack/*/opt", for example
"~/.config/nvim/pack/mycolors/opt/dark/colors/very_dark.vim".

&lt;code&gt;:packadd&lt;/code&gt;.  E.g. depending on the compiler
version:&lt;quote&gt;if foo_compiler_version &amp;gt; 34 packadd foo_new else packadd foo_old endifThe "after" directory is most likely not useful in a package. It's not disallowed though.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;:packadd&lt;/code&gt;.

Including this
generated file in the package means that the user can drop the package in the
pack directory and the help command works right away.  Don't forget to re-run
the command after changing the plugin help:&lt;quote&gt;:helptags path/start/foobar/doc :helptags path/opt/fooextra/doc&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;call foolib#getit()pack/foo/start/two/plugin/two.vim&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;call foolib#getit()pack/foo/start/lib/autoload/foolib.vim&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;func foolib#getit()This works, because start packages will be searched for autoload files, when sourcing the plugins.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site/pack/core/opt&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site&lt;/code&gt; needs to
be part of 'packpath'. It usually is, but might not be in cases like --clean
or setting $XDG_DATA_HOME during startup. Plugin's subdirectory name matches
plugin's name in specification. It is assumed that all plugins in the
directory are managed exclusively by &lt;code&gt;vim.pack&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; executable of at least
version 2.36. Target plugins should be Git repositories with versions as named
tags following semver convention &lt;code&gt;v&amp;lt;major&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;minor&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;patch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;vim.pack.add({
  -- Install "plugin1" and use default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
  'https://github.com/user/plugin1',
  -- Same as above, but using a table (allows setting other options)
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin1' },
  -- Specify plugin's name (here the plugin will be called "plugin2"
  -- instead of "generic-name")
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/generic-name', name = 'plugin2' },
  -- Specify version to follow during install and update
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin3',
    -- Version constraint, see |vim.version.range()|
    version = vim.version.range('1.0'),
  },
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin4',
    -- Git branch, tag, or commit hash
    version = 'main',
  },
})
-- Plugin's code can be used directly after `add()`
plugin1 = require('plugin1')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;add()&lt;/code&gt; call.
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;. Let's say, plugin
  named 'plugin1' has changed to &lt;code&gt;vim.version.range('*')&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;vim.pack.update({ 'plugin1' })&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; set to current commit hash.
  You can get it by running &lt;code&gt;vim.pack.update({ 'plugin-name' })&lt;/code&gt; and yanking
  the word describing current state (looks like &lt;code&gt;abc12345&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; set to whichever version you
  want it to be updated.
&lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt; - one of "install" (install on disk), "update" (update existing
  plugin), "delete" (delete from disk).
&lt;code&gt;spec&lt;/code&gt; - plugin's specification with defaults made explicit.
&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; - full path to plugin's directory.
&lt;code&gt;{src}&lt;/code&gt;       (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;) URI from which to install and pull updates. Any
                    format supported by &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; is allowed.
&lt;code&gt;{name}&lt;/code&gt;     (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;) Name of plugin. Will be used as directory name.
                    Default: &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; repository name.
&lt;code&gt;{version}&lt;/code&gt;  (&lt;code&gt;string|vim.VersionRange&lt;/code&gt;) Version to use for install and
                    updates. Can be:
&lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; (no value, default) to use repository's default
                      branch (usually &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;code&gt;{data}&lt;/code&gt;     (&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;) Arbitrary data associated with a plugin.
&lt;code&gt;{specs}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{opts}&lt;/code&gt;)                                          vim.pack.add()&lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;
        subdirectory (via &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt;) and update state to match &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;
        (via &lt;code&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; function)
      making it reachable by Nvim.
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; can be not the one actually
      present on disk. Execute vim.pack.update() to synchronize.
&lt;code&gt;{specs}&lt;/code&gt;  (&lt;code&gt;(string|vim.pack.Spec)[]&lt;/code&gt;) List of plugin specifications.
                 String item is treated as &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;{opts}&lt;/code&gt;   (&lt;code&gt;table?&lt;/code&gt;) A table with the following fields:

                   initial install. Default &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;{names}&lt;/code&gt;  (&lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;) List of plugin names to remove from disk. Must
                 be managed by vim.pack, not necessarily already added to
                 current session.
&lt;code&gt;table[]&lt;/code&gt;) A list of objects with the following fields:
&lt;code&gt;{path}&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;) Plugin's path on disk.
&lt;code&gt;{names}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{opts}&lt;/code&gt;)                                    vim.pack.update()&lt;code&gt;force&lt;/code&gt;:

        while the ones starting with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; will be reverted. It has special
        in-process LSP server attached to provide more interactive features.
        Currently supported methods:
&lt;code&gt;gO&lt;/code&gt; via lsp-defaults or
          vim.lsp.buf.document_symbol()) - show structure of the buffer.
&lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; via lsp-defaults or
          vim.lsp.buf.hover()) - show more information at cursor. Like
          details of particular pending change or newer tag.
        Execute :write to confirm update, execute :quit to discard the
        update.
&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, make updates right away.
&lt;code&gt;{names}&lt;/code&gt;  (&lt;code&gt;string[]?&lt;/code&gt;) List of plugin names to update. Must be managed
                 by vim.pack, not necessarily already added to current
                 session. Default: names of all plugins added to current
                 session via vim.pack.add().
&lt;code&gt;{opts}&lt;/code&gt;   (&lt;code&gt;table?&lt;/code&gt;) A table with the following fields:
&lt;code&gt;{force}&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;) Whether to skip confirmation and make
                   updates immediately. Default &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.
