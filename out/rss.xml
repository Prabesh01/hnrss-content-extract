    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Product Engineer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Location: NYC (in-person)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help us build everything a consumer brand needs to grow. Weâre just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Youâll be shipping end-to-end product and working directly with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About Converge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to profitably grow the world's consumer brands. That begins with helping them understand which marketing efforts are driving profitable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;200+ consumer brands, including publicly traded companies, rely on Converge to check in on their marketing performance up to a dozen times a day. They drill down to figure out what's working and decide where to shift million-dollar marketing budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ship even more, we've raised $5.7M from some of the best investors, including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, and the founders of Posthog, Algolia, Shipbob, ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What you'll do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ship product fully end-to-end. All the way from designing the system and data models to building out the interface and polishing the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We trust you to build the best solution to a customer's problem. We lead with context and give you full autonomy to design the solution. This means you'll need to build a deep understanding of the problem, obsess over the solution, and ship it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work directly with customers. You'll talk to them, ship, get feedback, and iterate. There are no middlemen. This means you can move incredibly fast: you message a customer, create a PR, and can have it fixed within hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some examples of projects you could own:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effortless Slack conversations: Customers screenshot their Converge reports up to a dozen of times a day (!) to share with the rest of the company. Instead, they should be able to directly tag and message a teammate from any number in Converge and have this synced bidirectionally with Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Centralizing all growth efforts: Converge already centralizes all growth metrics, but the information explaining them is still scattered. We want overlay the context that actually explains trends like pricing updates, budget changes, and promo calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creative analytics: All growth teams use a separate tool to iterate on ad creatives, but they would want to run this workflow on Converge. We should build a Creative Analytics product on top of our data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents: We never wanted to jump on the AI train for the sake of hype. But now that we have the foundations in place, there's huge leverage in building agents that can help growth teams understand their data and act on it more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Converge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're a team of just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Join us if you want to get rid of office politics and just take ownership to get a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though you join early, this job comes with real engineering challenges. We process $4B in online orders annually, 20TB of data flows through Converge each month, and we've collected around 10B customer interactions to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you're shipping will actually get used. 50% of our customers use us daily (!), while this is only 13% for the average SaaS company. You will have an immediate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We love working in-person. You'll like it here if you do too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think you could be a founder, there's no better way to learn than to talk to customers and ship. That's what you'll be spending all of your time on. We obsess over the details and will share honest feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What we're looking for&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong experience working across the stack (4+ YOE). We work with React, Python, Postgres, and Clickhouse. Experience building data-intensive products or familiarity with Clickhouse is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've previously built products or large features fully end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You obsess over the quality of what you're building, both in UX and code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compensation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salary: $175K - $240K + equity (0.6% - 0.85%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Private health, dental, and vision insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pension &amp;amp; 401k contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interview process*&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intro call (30 min): We want to learn about your motivations to join Converge, determine why youâd be a great fit, and answer any questions you have for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical (1h): We work through a typical engineering problem we face at Converge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Culture (45 min): We dive into your past experiences to learn how you like to work and what motivates you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superday (1 day): Join us for a day to actually build something! You get to meet the team, we get to meet you, it's great. (fully paid)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(*) This can all be done in 2 days. If you want to move quickly, we do too. Our founding engineer was on a plane to meet us just days after our first call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We raised $5.7M from some of the best investors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;James Hawkins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nicolas Dessaigne&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Founding team&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Did you knowâ¦&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All co-founders have written code that has run in production as part of Converge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We closed our first publicly traded company during our YC batch from our living room in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thomas and Tiago (Founding Engineer) worked together when Thomas was just an intern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michel (Customer Success) was responsible for most of the incoming Converge Support tickets in his previous job as a freelance tracking consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thomas and Jan were best friends in high school, and Jan and Jerome met in their first year of college.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI is Killing B2B SaaS&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;SaaS is the most profitable business model on Earth.1 It’s easy to understand why: build once, sell the same thing again ad infinitum, and don’t suffer any marginal costs on more sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been writing software for more than half my life. In the last year itself, I’ve talked to hundreds of founders and operators in SF, from preseed to Series E companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is bringing an existential threat to a lot of B2B SaaS executives: How to keep asking customers for renewal, when every customer feels they can get something better built with vibe-coded AI products?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the market is pricing it in. Morgan Stanley’s SaaS basket has lagged the Nasdaq by 40 points since December. HubSpot and Klaviyo are down ~30%. Analysts are writing notes titled “No Reasons to Own” software stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The relation between vibe coding and B2B SaaS sales&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new problem for B2B SaaS is that with AI, customers can get something working with vibe coding. There are tens of vibe coding “internal tool” services that promise to connect to every integration in the world to pump out CRUD and workflow apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever they build simply works. It takes some wrangling to get there (one Series C VP listed eleven different vibe coding tools they’ve tried and the pros and cons between each on a phone call once), but productivity gains are immediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And vibe coding is fun. You feel like a mad wizard using the right incantation 2 to get this magical new silicon intelligence to do exactly what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they don’t know, though, is that a poorly architected system will fail, eventually. As every senior programmer (eventually) understands, our job is complex because we have to understand the relationships in the real world, the processes involved, and the workflows needed, and representing it in a robust way to create a stable system. AI can’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-programmers don’t know any of this nuance. One Series E CEO told me that they’re re-evaluating the quarterly renewal of their engineering productivity software because they along with an engineer reimplemented something using Github and Notion APIs. They were paying $30,000 to a popular tool3 and they were not going to renew anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How does it impact B2B sales?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If customers feel like they aren’t being served exactly like they want to, they are more likely to churn. The reason behind all this is that customers are demanding more from their B2B vendors, because they know what’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, you would change your company to fit what your ERP and pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now, everyone can see that agentic coding makes an unprecedented level of flexibility possible. And customers are demanding that flexibility, and if they don’t get it, they’ll leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week itself I was on a phone call with a Series B AE talking about how they’re potentially losing an $X00,000 account just because the customer can’t use a specific failure reporting workflow in the SaaS. They’re now working with me to build what the customer needs and retain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to survive&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Be a System of Record&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the entire company’s workflows operates on your platform, i.e. you’re a line-of-business SaaS, you are integrated into their existing team already. They know your UI and rely on you on the day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, to create a data visualization I won’t seek any SaaS. I’ll just code one myself using many of the popular vibe coding tools (my team actually did that and it’s vastly more flexible than what we’d get off-the-shelf).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a “System of Record” means you’re embedded so deeply that there’s no choice but to win. My prediction is that we’ll see more SaaS companies go from the application layer to offering their robust SoR as their primary selling point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Security, authentication, and robustness&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where vibe-coded apps silently fail — and where established SaaS platforms earn their keep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a non-technical team vibe-codes an internal tool, they’re not thinking about environment keys, XSS vulnerabilities or API keys hardcoded in client-side JavaScript. They’re not implementing rate limiting, audit logs, or proper session management. They’re definitely not thinking about SOC 2 compliance, GDPR data residency requirements, or HIPAA audit trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen it firsthand: a finance team built a “quick” expense approval tool that stored unencrypted reports in a public S3 bucket. A sales ops team created a commission calculator that anyone with the URL could access — no auth required. These aren’t edge cases. They’re the norm when software is built without security as a foundational concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise SaaS platforms have spent years (and millions) solving these problems: role-based access control, encryption at rest and in transit, penetration testing, compliance certifications, incident response procedures. Your customers may not consciously value this — until something breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that security is invisible when it works. You need to communicate this value proactively: remind customers that the “simple” tool they could vibe-code themselves would require them to also handle auth, permissions, backups, uptime, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Adapt to the customer, not the other way around&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times of asking customers to change how they work are gone. Now, SaaS vendors that differentiate by being ultra customizable win the hearts of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? It’s the most powerful secret to increase usage. We’ve all heard the classic SaaS problem where the software is sold at the beginning of the year, but no one actually ends up using it because of how inflexible it is and the amount of training needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if a SaaS is underutilized, it gets noticed. And that leads to churn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the case with one of my customers, they have a complex SaaS for maintenance operations. But turns out, this was not being used at the technician level because they found the UI too complex4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How I’m solving this is essentially a whitelabelled vibe-coding platform with in-built distribution and secure deployments. When they heard of my solution they were immediately onboard. Their customer success teams quickly coded a very specific mobile webapp for the technicians to use and deployed it in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the IC technician is exposed to just those parts of the SaaS that they care about i.e. creating maintenance work orders. The executives get what they want too, vibe coding custom reports exactly the way they want vs going through complicated BI config. They are able to build exactly what they want and feel like digital gods while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usage for that account was under 35%, and is now over 70%. They are now working closely with me to vibe code new “micro-apps” that work according to all of their customer workflows. And the best part? This is all on top of their existing SaaS which works as a system of record and handles security, authentication, and supports lock-in by being a data and a UI moat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what I’m building: a way for SaaS companies to let their end-users vibe code on top of their platform (More on that below). My customers tell me it’s the best thing they’ve done for retention, engagement, and expansion in 2026 – because when your users are building on your platform, they’re not evaluating your competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Real Shift&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve realized after hundreds of conversations with founders and operators: AI isn’t killing B2B SaaS. It’s killing B2B SaaS that refuses to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SaaS model was built on a simple premise: we build it once, you pay forever. That worked when building software was hard. But now your customers have tasted what’s possible. They’ve seen their finance team whip up a custom dashboard in an afternoon. They’ve watched a non-technical PM build an internal tool that actually fits their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t unsee that. You can’t go back to paying $X0,000/year for software that almost does what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survivors won’t be the SaaS companies with the best features. They’ll be the ones who become platforms – who let customers build on top of them instead of instead of them. When I showed a well-known VC what I was building to help SaaS companies do exactly this, he said: “This is the future of marketplaces and software companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe. Or maybe this is just another cycle and traditional SaaS will adapt like it always has. But I know this: the companies I’m talking to aren’t waiting around to find out. They’re already rebuilding their relationship with customers from “use our product” to “build on our platform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether AI will eat your SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s whether you’ll be the one holding the fork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m solving exactly this problem with a whitelabelled AI platform for B2B SaaS companies, so your users can vibe code customized workflows on top of their existing system of record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My customers tell me this is the best way to support retention, engagement, and expansion in 2026.

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, my friend and fellow Recurser, Frank, picked up an arcade machine for the Recurse Center. We call it the RCade. He wanted to leave the original CRT in - which I think is a great choice! - and drove it off of a Raspberry Pi. Eventually we wanted to move to a more powerful computer, but we needed a way to connect it to the display. Off-hand, I mentioned that I could build a CRT display adapter that interfaces with a normal computer over USB. This is that project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the display expects&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CRT in the RCade has a JAMMA connector, and Frank bought a converter that goes between VGA and JAMMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think we could just use an off-the-shelf VGA adapter to drive it at this point, but it's not that simple. The CRT runs at a weird resolution; We started with 320x240 but eventually wanted to target 336x262, which is super non-standard. Even 320x240 is unattainable by most display adapters, which typically can't go below 640x480. A custom solution would allow us to output any arbitrary resolution we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that the Pi, with the VGA board we were using, only supports 18-bit colour, and we wanted to improve this. Even on the RCade's CRT, colour banding was an obvious issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to use a laptop, not a desktop, which meant not using a PCI-e card. Instead, a USB interface would be preferable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wait, but what is VGA?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;VGA is a signaling protocol that maps almost exactly 1:1 with what a CRT actually does.&lt;/p&gt;Taken from wikimedia.org&lt;p&gt;Inside of a CRT, there are 3 electron guns, which correspond to red, green, and blue colour values. Two electromagnets in the neck of the tube are responsible for steering the beam - one steers horizontally and one steers vertically. To draw an image, the beam moves across the screen one horizontal line at a time, and the electron guns are rapidly modulated in order to display the correct colour at each pixel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VGA contains analog signals for these R, G, and B electron guns. It also contains an HSYNC and VSYNC signal, which are used so that the driver and the CRT can agree on what pixel is being drawn at a given time. Between the VGA input and the CRT is a very simple circuit which locks onto these HSYNC and VSYNC pulses and synchronizes the sweeping of the beam.&lt;/p&gt;Taken from pyroelectro.com&lt;p&gt;The HSYNC pulses happen in between horizontal lines, and the VSYNC pulses happen in between frames. There are dead zones around each pulse - referred to as the front and back porch - which give the electron beam time to sweep back across the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, all we really need are those R, G, B, HSYNC, and VSYNC signals, running at precise timing, and synced properly relative to each other. Conceptually this is actually pretty simple!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attempt 1: Using the RP2040's PIO&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the Raspberry Pi RP2040 a lot. It's relatively cheap (around $1 USD) and has tons of on-board RAM - 264 KB in fact! It also has what is called Programmable IO, or PIO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've never used the PIO before, but the basic idea is that you can write assembly programs where every instruction takes exactly one cycle, and has useful primitives for interacting with GPIO. It's a fairly limited instruction set, but it allows for bit-banging precise cycle-accurate custom protocols. It's exactly what I need to modulate a VGA signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PIO code ended up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// 1. low for 320+16=336 pixels // 2. high for 30 pixels // 3. low for 34 pixels // 4. repeat // runs on sm0 // 6 instrs -&amp;gt; can save some with sidesetting let hsync = pio::pio_asm!( ".wrap_target", /* begin pixels + front porch */ "irq set 0 [2]", // tell vsync we're doing 1 line "set pins, 1 [31]", // go low for 32 "set X, 8 [15]", // +16 = 48 "a:", "jmp X-- a [31]", // each loop 32, * 9 = 288, total = 336 /* end front porch, being assert hsync */ "set pins, 0 [29]", // assert hsync for 30 /* end assert hsync, begin back porch */ "set pins, 1 [29]", // deassert, wait 32 (note there is extra delay after the wrap) ".wrap" ); // NOTE - we get irq at *end* of line so we have to time things accordingly // 1. low for 242 lines -&amp;gt; but irq 2 every line for the first 240 // 2. high for 3 lines // 3. low for 22 lines // 4. repeat // runs on sm1 // 19 instr let vsync = pio::pio_asm!( ".side_set 1 opt", ".wrap_target", "set Y, 6", "a_outer:", "set X, 31", "a:", "wait 1 irq 0", "irq set 2", "jmp X-- a", // 32 lines per inner loop "jmp Y-- a_outer", // 7 outer loops = 224 "set X, 15", // 16 more lines = 240 "z:" "wait 1 irq 0", "irq set 2", "jmp X-- z", "wait 1 irq 0", // wait for end of last rgb line "wait 1 irq 0", // 2 more lines for front porch "wait 1 irq 0", "set X, 2 side 0", // assert vsync "b:", "wait 1 irq 0", "jmp X-- b", // wait for 3 lines "set X, 20 side 1", // deassert vsync "c:", "wait 1 irq 0", "jmp X-- c" // wait for 21 lines (back porch) ".wrap", ); // 2 cycles per pixel so we run at double speed // 6 instr let rgb = pio::pio_asm!( "out X, 32", // holds 319, which we have to read from the FIFO ".wrap_target", "mov Y, X", "wait 1 irq 2", // wait until start of line "a:", "out pins, 16", // write to rgb from dma "jmp Y-- a", "mov pins, NULL", // output black ".wrap" );&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full code lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 3 separate PIO programs. &lt;code&gt;hsync&lt;/code&gt; is responsible for keeping time and generating HSYNC pulses. At the start of each line, it generates an IRQ event that the other programs use for synchronization. &lt;code&gt;vsync&lt;/code&gt; counts these events and generates the VSYNC pulses. Finally, &lt;code&gt;rgb&lt;/code&gt; reads pixel data from DMA and outputs to the RGB pins in precise time with the other signals. The &lt;code&gt;out pins, 16&lt;/code&gt; signifies that we're only doing 16-bit colour for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of weirdness in here to get around the constraints of the PIO. For example, between all 3 programs, only a maximum of 31 instructions are allowed. All of the VGA parameters (resolution, porch length, etc.) are hard-coded, and changing these would require at least a small rewrite. It's pretty brittle in that regard, but for our use-case it's sufficient as a proof-of-concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here it is running the actual CRT in the RCade:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to fill the framebuffer with a repeating pattern, but I messed up my code, hence it looking weird. That's fine - it was enough to verify my VGA program worked!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, every time I popped off the back of the RCade to work on it was terrifying. Not because of the lethal voltages inside, but because Recursers absolutely love the RCade. I often joke that if I were to break it, I would basically be the anti-Frank!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I had something that could take a framebuffer and throw it onto the CRT, it was time to get the image from my computer to the RP2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let's write a kernel module!&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;My plan was to write a Linux kernel module that would expose itself as a framebuffer, and then send that framebuffer over USB to the RP2040. On the framebuffer side, this involved interfacing with the DRM layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually made decent progress here, although I kernel panicked many, many times. I never bothered to set up a proper development environment (oops), so pretty much any bug would require me to reboot my computer. This was super annoying and tedious, although I did learn a lot. I found cursed things in the official documentation, like interrobangs!&lt;/p&gt;Linus pls&lt;p&gt;I got as far as getting a framebuffer to show up at the correct resolution and refresh rate. Along this journey though, I discovered the GUD kernel module, and quickly realized I should use that instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GUD is... pretty good&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so this GUD thing is sick. It's a USB display adapter protocol - exactly what I need! It was originally designed to send video from a computer to a Pi Zero for use as a secondary display. It consists of an upstreamed (!!!) kernel module that runs on the host, and separate gadget software that runs on the Pi Zero. I decided I would just write my own gadget implementation to run on the RP2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a protocol, GUD seems decent. It supports compression over the wire, and only sends the deltas of what's changed in the host's framebuffer. It's also pretty robust in terms of allowing the gadget to advertise what features it supports - compression is optional, and there's flexibility in colour depth and resolution. And again, it's upstreamed into the kernel, so anyone on modern Linux could use my display adapter with no software tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, GUD has almost no documentation. I figured out what I needed to do by reverse engineering the kernel module, which involved recompiling it to add some debugging statements. The protocol is simple enough that is wasn't too much of a hassle, and it didn't take long before I had developed a gadget implementation in Rust for the RP2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with that, we saw our first Linux images on the CRT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, it looks terrible. Several years ago, I had built a board that implements the R/G/B DACs out of resistors, and I reused that for this project. It can only do 12 bits of colour maximum, and for this test I only bothered to wire up ~2 bits per channel, which is basically unusable. But it proves the concept works!&lt;/p&gt;The board I built several years ago. It was originally designed to fit an STM32 development board.&lt;p&gt;To be honest, it's pretty lucky that this board came with me to New York. I'm surprised I didn't either throw it out or move it to my parent's place. It was probably in some other box of things I deemed worth keeping around.&lt;/p&gt;The VGA board connected to the RP2040.&lt;p&gt;You can see from the above picture that I really connected the bare minimum for a proof-of-concept. I find perfboard soldering to be a bit tedious!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, you may notice in the video that the entire screen is shifted to the left. The left side has wrapped around and is now on the right side. On initial boot, it would look fine; over time it would gradually get worse and worse. This is a bug in my implementation - I suspect it's some kind of buffer underflow that's happening, such that each time it occurs, the PIO gets progressively more out of sync. But this is just a guess; I didn't look into it too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colour depth issue is trivial to fix, but this next one isn't. The framerate sucks! You can even see it in the video above, where you can watch the new frame scroll down the screen. The RP2040 can only do USB FS (full-speed), which is capable of 11 Mbps. At the 320x240x16 bpp we were originally targeting, every frame is 153.6 kB. At our maximum USB FS speed, that's less than 10 FPS! Embarrasingly, I had originally done the math with a bandwidth of 11 MBps, not 11 Mbps, so I was off by a factor of 8. I was hoping to get something at least temporarily usable but had to go back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Going on a GUD gadget side quest&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who even needs microcontrollers anyway? My next idea was to use the normal GUD gadget implementation, running on a Pi Zero, but outputting to VGA over GPIO. Conceptually this is pretty simple, although in practice it was anything but. The canonical GUD gadget software was based on a 2021 version of Buildroot, which was too old to output VGA. I tried, and failed, to update the Buildroot version, as well as to backport the VGA overlay. Neither of those really worked, but I didn't really know what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also played around with generating a custom NixOS image that had a modern kernel and the GUD gadget kernel module. When that didn't work I prepared to run a user space GUD gadget implementation on Raspberry Pi OS. But like, isn't that boring? And then I'll still be stuck at 18 bit colour! And sometimes a girl just wants to tickle her electrons :3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attempt... 2? 3? 1+i? Returning to MCU land&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so my beloved RP2040 doesn't support USB HS (high-speed). My beloved RP2350 (the newer version of the same chip) doesn't either. But some of my beloved STM32s do!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially I was planning to go computer -&amp;gt; USB HS -&amp;gt; STM32 -&amp;gt; SPI bus -&amp;gt; RP2040 -&amp;gt; VGA. But like, that's complicated, and there are 2 microcontrollers to program, and there is so much to go wrong, and the SPI bus protocol is going to need to be robust against lost/extra bits, and AAAAAAAAAA I don't wanna!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But! STM32! I learned through research that some of the nicer ones have an LTDC peripheral, which, among other things, can drive an LCD display. And guess what? Many LCDs take in an R, G, B, HSYNC, and VSYNC signal. That's right - they pretend they're a CRT, and they pretend they have a cute little electron gun inside of them, and the STM32 is like "ok I got u" and can just like, do this natively. And I realize that this is what VGA is, but it's so, so funny to me that the protocol is literally just the manifestation of a physical design that is largely obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so at this point I'm like, is this even a real project anymore? I'm just connecting the USB peripheral to the LTDC peripheral. What part of this is supposed to take effort? I had already written the GUD gadget implementation. Wasn't I basically already done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OH BOY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, by now it's Christmas time and I fly back to Canada to hang out with my family, as you would expect. I had none of my hardware with me, so now felt like a good time to design the actual board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Christmas Eve, this is what I had. Conceptually, it's a pretty basic board - there's the USB HS input, the VGA output, 3 8-bit DACs, some RAM for the framebuffer, and supporting components. At the heart of it is the STM32H723, which is a microcontroller that's advertised as supporting USB HS and LTDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth talking about the DACs a bit. They have a few requirements. They need to map the 8-bit binary space uniformly to the analog domain. They also need to act as a resistor divider - my I/O is at 3.3V, but VGA expects a maximum of 0.7 volts for R/G/B. And finally, they need to be impedance-matched to the 75 ohms of the VGA cable, to prevent reflections and ringing that show up in the image. I am... pretty doubtful we need this at our resolution, but it doesn't hurt, and it increases nerd cred (^:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encoded all of these requirements into a system of equations, threw it into a SAT solver, and computed all of my resistor values. I checked the output manually and it made sense, so I used these values in my DAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting is the length-matched traces between the STM32 and the HyperRAM. Length-matching ensures that all the signals arrive at the same time; if some arrive too early or late it can cause issues. The traces aren't impedance-matched, but I did a bit of math and determined they were short enough that I didn't have to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I want to talk about the USB port. I used Mini-USB. Alright look. I know I know, I should have used USB-C. But I don't like USB-C! It's a dumb standard. We spent decades teaching non-technical users to plug the square wire into the square hole and the round wire into the round hole. And then we made every hole the same shape!! But they don't all support the same things!! Not even every cable supports the same things!! I hate it!! And Mini-USB is so cute. It's not reversible, but who cares? It's more robust than micro USB, while still being small. And it's my board, my rules. So yes, I will keep sending pictures of this board to people, and they will keep complaining it doesn't use USB-C. And I will continue to not care! Mini-USB is CUTE. And by the way, if you read this entire article and this is the section you choose to engage with, then you are boring!!! You will never live up to Mini-USB!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay okay sorry about that. I am calm now. With all of that out of the way, I placed the order for the boards. I bought 5 of them, 2 of which were partially assembled. I would complete the rest of the assembly myself, but I didn't want to worry about the more finicky stuff. Between taxes, tariffs, and shipping, it came to a little over a hundred dollars USD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disaster strikes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a week later, I was back home in NYC. My boards hadn't arrived yet, although I did have access to an STM32H723 development board at this point. To prepare for my boards, I started porting my RP2040 firmware to the STM32H723.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things were going well until I tried getting USB set up. For some reason, I could only get it working at USB FS speeds. I figured I was just initializing something wrong - maybe a register I was forgetting about, or that wasn't in the HAL? I did a lot of digging, before finding this hidden in the datasheet (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devices embed a USB OTG high-speed (up to 480 Mbit/s) device/host/OTG peripheral that supports both full-speed and high-speed operations. It integrates the transceivers for full-speed operation (12 Mbit/s) and a UTMI low-pin interface (ULPI) for high-speed operation (480 Mbit/s). When using the USB OTG_HS interface in HS mode, an external PHY device connected to the ULPI is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My heart sank. Yes, despite this chip very clearly advertising support for USB HS, it can't actually do that without an external PHY. This is super easy to miss - I actually told other people about the problem, and often they would tell me I was incorrect until I showed it to them in the datasheet. I've also found many posts on the ST Community forums from people running into the same thing. So yeah, I need a new board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because boards are expensive, I figure I'll still use the rev 1 board to validate as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disaster strikes, again&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the boards come, I complete assembly of one, plug it into my computer, and nothing happens. I find out that the 3.3V rail is shorted to ground. This is the same on all of my boards, even the 3 that are disassembled. Some debugging later, it turns out I moved a via in KiCad and didn't do a re-pour. My ground plane was connected to my power plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a full CI/CD pipeline set up for my PCBs, so I was surprised it didn't catch this. It turns out it has a bit of wiggle-room, and the re-pour was small enough it didn't get picked up. I now know I need to be disciplined and run DRC locally, ensuring there are literally no differences (and if there are, commit them and push them up to my Git forge).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although annoying, and quite embarrassing, this wasn't a huge deal. I used a drill bit and very carefully drilled out the offending via by hand. It made a bit of a mess - make sure you use breathing protection - but I got a board that worked.&lt;/p&gt;The drilled-out via. You can see it directly under the text, near the center-bottom of the image.&lt;p&gt;At this point I wrote some code that exercised the HyperRAM and VGA. Everything worked great, so I began work on the new board. Here's what my development setup looked like while I was testing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the rev 1 board didn't work out, Frank pointed out that the difference between it and the previous revision was stark:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a bad pace of development!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attempt 4 - Rev 2&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I needed an STM32 that supported ULPI (used for talking to the USB PHY), LTDC, and some kind of external RAM. I looked at dozens of chips and found all sorts of blockers. Chips that actually supported both (but they had overlapping pins), chips that were advertised as supporting both (but in actuality, could only do one or the other, depending on the specific model number), and chips that actually could do both, with unconflicting pins, but only in a BGA package. I did not particularly want to deal with that, mainly because the tiny vias and traces would balloon the board cost even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up settling on the STM32H750IBT, a massive, 176 pin, LQFP chip. This thing is larger than some New York apartments, and at over $10 USD, it costs about the same! I have bought entire dev boards for a fraction of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I picked out the chip, I basically redesigned the entire board from scratch. Sure, I could reuse the DACs, but I needed completely new RAM (the new chip has no HyperBus), as well as the USB PHY and supporting components. Now that my Christmas vacation was over, it took me a solid week to get everything designed. This isn't my most complicated board, but it's certainly my most complex routing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, look at those traces. I'm using basically all available space just to get them to be the same length. ST famously has bad pinouts, and because one of the memory controller pins is located on the complete opposite side of the chip, literally all of the rest of the RAM traces had to be lengthened. And the RAM has a 16-bit data bus. I had to route 38 length-matched traces for the memory alone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USB PHY also had a decent number of traces to route, although far less than the RAM. This is probably the part where I'm supposed to say that like, crosstalk is bad and stuff, but we're just gonna ignore that. I had like no space; leave me alone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the board looked like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with that, I ordered the board. Waiting for it to arrive just about killed me, but when it finally did, I got to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Board bring-up&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board bring-up is a magical thing. One-by-one, you enable each part of the board, and you make sure that everything works the way you expect. Given that USB burned me before, I decided to start there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right out of the gate, I was off to a bumpy start. I got the USB technically working, and I even got it to show up on my computer as USB HS (yay!), but it was super, super flaky. Eventually I worked out that its crystal oscillator was unstable. Going back to the datasheet, I realized I missed a 1M ohm resistor, which was meant to be put in parallel with the crystal. I didn't have one handy, but I know the human body is around that resistance. I put one finger on each terminal of the crystal. It immediately stabilized. I was pretty ecstatic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day I went to the Recurse Center and stole a 1M ohm resistor to affix to the board. (Faculty, if you're reading this, I owe you about a tenth of a cent. Sorry!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that over, the rest of the bring-up process was pretty smooth. I got the LTDC running and ported over the rest of the code that implemented the GUD protocol. I had written things pretty naively but, to my surprise, it didn't need any optimization for high-speed USB. I guess that's what a microcontroller with a 480 MHz core will get you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Running it in the RCade cabinet&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was already at the Recurse Center at this point, so I popped the back off the RCade, unplugged the VGA from the Pi, and plugged it into my board. It started up immediately - the colours looked great and I got the full 60 Hz framerate. To be honest, I was shocked at how good it looked, and the crowd that had formed was shocked too. I wasn't really a believer that 24 bit colour would be noticeable, but I was totally wrong. The lack of colour banding was striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I plugged the board into the Pi, and Frank reconfigured it to make my display adapter the primary display. We launched the normal RCade software and played some games. They looked truly amazing; nothing like before. Rose, one of the main people who developed the software, joked that it looked so good that some of the graphical shortcuts she took were no longer sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to tell in the pictures but the difference in person was striking. Where it's most obvious is in the lack of banding around the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This felt amazing, but I wasn't quite ready to leave the board installed. It was fragile - especially with the resistor I bodged on - and it was expensive. I took my board back out and Frank reverted the RCade to how it was before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designing a case&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest. I don't get that much joy out of 3D modeling. I find it frustrating, tedious, and generally unfulfilling. To get around this, I decided to use YAPP to design the case. YAPP is a parametric box generator written in OpenSCAD. I wrote a few dozen lines of code and ended up with this beauty:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took barely any time at all and only took 2 physical revisions before I was happy with it. I added the OpenSCAD code to my board repository and CI/CD pipeline. Now, it builds all the files I need to order the boards, as well as the STL files for the case.&lt;/p&gt;HE'S BEGINNING TO TAKE FORM&lt;p&gt;And now, with the board in the case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point I was starting to prepare myself to install it in the RCade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disaster strikes, again??&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything was done, so I expected I'd just plug it in and be good to go. When I did this, though, nothing happened. After some debugging I realized the USB had completely died on my board. It wasn't showing up on any computer I connected it to, although the STM32 was still chugging along happily (and outputting to VGA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still haven't figured out exactly what happened here. I was having a bit of flakiness with the USB already. I vaguely suspect ESD to either the STM32 or the USB PHY, but am not super confident this is the cause. I'm going to keep looking into this. (inb4: wow maybe you shouldn't have touched the crystal without grounding yourself first!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I assembled a second board and got that installed instead. I'm slightly nervous because I don't have a third board to use if this one also dies, and I don't want to order any more until I can figure out what's killing them. That said, it has been a few days now since I installed it, and despite running 24/7, there's no signs of it dying yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the board in its case, installed in the RCade. We're still running it off the Raspberry Pi for now, but soon we'll have that switched out with a laptop. I can't wait!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future improvements&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are all sorts of things I want to change. I want the board to also support audio, with an integrated amp. Perhaps even a tube amp? I just think it would be funny. And being able to read input from the controls would be cool too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the software side, I want double or triple buffering. I actually got them both working, although they didn't play nice with the deltas that GUD sends over the wire. There are workarounds to this that I haven't implemented yet. It would also be nice to give GUD the ability to disable these deltas; perhaps that would be a good feature for me to add to the kernel module. Writing some documentation on the GUD protocol could be good too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a really fun project, and it's not over yet, but I think all the hard stuff is pretty much done (although - I've thought that before!). I really wasn't expecting this to take as long as it did, but I learned so much, and I'm a stronger engineer for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Source code&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a few repositories of interest:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardware lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, the original software for the RP2040 lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My very messy DAC equations live here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Nix GUD gadget attempt lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a fair bit of scratch code while learning (such as for my kernel module), but I don't think any of it was worth putting it in my Git forge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;OpenClaw is What Apple Intelligence Should Have Been&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something strange is happening with Mac Minis. They’re selling out everywhere, and it’s not because people suddenly need more coffee table computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you browse Reddit or HN, you’ll see the same pattern: people are buying Mac Minis specifically to run AI agents with computer use. They’re setting up headless machines whose sole job is to automate their workflows. OpenClaw—the open-source framework that lets you run Claude, GPT-5, or whatever model you want to actually control your computer—has become the killer app for Mac hardware. Not Final Cut. Not Logic. An AI agent that clicks buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly what Apple Intelligence should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple had everything: the hardware, the ecosystem, the reputation for “it just works.” They could have shipped an agentic AI that actually automated your computer instead of summarizing your notifications. Imagine if Siri could genuinely file your taxes, respond to emails, or manage your calendar by actually using your apps, not through some brittle API layer that breaks every update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They could have charged $500 more per device and people would have paid it. The margins would have been obscene. And they would have won the AI race not by building the best model, but by being the only company that could ship an AI you’d actually trust with root access to your computer. That trust—built over decades—was their moat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why didn’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe they just didn’t see it. That sounds mundane, but it’s probably the most common reason companies miss opportunities. When you’re Apple, you’re thinking about chip design, manufacturing scale, and retail strategy. An open-source project letting AI agents control computers might not ping your radar until it’s already happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or maybe they saw it and decided the risk wasn’t worth it. If you’re Apple, you don’t want your AI agent automatically buying things, posting on social media, or making irreversible decisions. The liability exposure would be enormous. Better to ship something safe and limited than something powerful and unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s another dynamic at play. Look at who’s about to get angry about OpenClaw-style automation: LinkedIn, Facebook, anyone with a walled garden and a careful API strategy. These services depend on friction. They want you to use their app, see their ads, stay in their ecosystem. An AI that can automate away that friction is an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Apple had built this, they’d be fighting Instagram over ToS violations by Tuesday. They’d be testifying in front of Congress about AI agents committing fraud. Every tech platform would be updating their terms to explicitly ban Apple Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By letting some third party do it, Apple gets plausible deniability. They’re just selling hardware. Not their fault what people run on it. It’s the same strategy that made them billions in the App Store while maintaining they’re “not responsible for what developers do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think this is short-term thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what people miss about moats: they compound. The reason Microsoft dominated PCs wasn’t just that they had the best OS. It’s that everyone built for Windows, which made Windows more valuable, which made more people build for Windows. Network effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Apple owned the agent layer, they could have created the most defensible moat in tech. Because an AI agent gets better the more it knows about you. And Apple already has all your data, all your apps, all your devices. They could have built an agent that works across your iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Watch seamlessly—something no one else can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, they could have owned the API. Want your service to work with Apple Agent? You play by Apple’s rules. Suddenly Apple isn’t fighting with platforms—they’re the platform that platforms need to integrate with. It’s the App Store playbook all over again, but for the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mac Mini rush is a preview of this future. People want agents. They want automation. They want to pay for it. They’re literally buying extra computers just to run someone else’s AI on Apple’s hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple is getting the hardware revenue but missing the platform revenue. That might look smart this quarter. But platform revenue is what built Apple into a $3 trillion company. And platforms are what create trillion-dollar moats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect ten years from now, people will look back at 2024-2025 as the moment Apple had a clear shot at owning the agent layer and chose not to take it. Not because they couldn’t build it—they obviously could—but because they were optimizing for this year’s legal risk instead of next decade’s platform power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people buying Mac Minis to run AI agents aren’t just early adopters. They’re showing Apple exactly what product they should have built. Whether Apple is paying attention is another question entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wirth's Revenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1995, Turing laureate Niklaus Wirth wrote an essay called A Plea for Lean Software in which he mostly gripes about the state of software at the time. Among these gripes is this claim which Wirth attributes to his colleague Martin Reiser1, though it's become to be known as Wirth's Law:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing his best grandpa Simpson impersonation, Wirth complains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;About 25 years ago, an interactive text editor could be designed with as little as 8,000 bytes ofstorage. (Modern program editors request 100 times that much!) An operating system had to manage with 8,000 bytes, and a compiler had to fit into 32 Kbytes, whereas their modern descendants require megabytes. Has all this inflated software become any faster? On the contrary. Were it not for a thousand times faster hardware, modern software would be utterly unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from the numbers involved here, which must sound utterly preposterous to the average modern reader, there's a lot to relate to. My 25 year career in software, all of which happened after 1995, was in many ways a story in two parts about Wirth's Law, an action and a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I disagree with Wirth's conclusion that nothing of value had been gained for the loss in efficiency. When he laments "the advent of windows, cut-and-paste strategies, and pop-up menus, [..] the replacement of meaningful command words by pretty icons", he is not properly appreciating the value these features had in making computing accessible to more people, and is focusing too much on their runtime cost. Programmers are often too quick to judge software on its technical merits rather than it's social ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wirth passed away 2 years ago, but he was a giant in the field of Computer Science and a huge inspiration to me and to many of my other inspirations. In many ways, my focus on simplicity and my own system design sensibilities find their genesis with him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wirth's law is so self evidently true that it's been a topic of continuous investigation and rediscovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A notable example of this was Dan Luu's great post on input lag back in 2017. He felt that input latency was getting worse over time, so he got a high speed camera and measured the delay between pressing a key and the letter appearing on screen across a lot of different hardware. The lowest latency computer was the Apple 2e from 1983.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Input latency has gone up since 1983 because there is a lot more software involved in the pipeline for handling input. The kind of hardware interrupt based input handling the Apple 2e had is not flexible enough to meet modern requirements, so this additional complexity buys us a lot of value... but it's certainly not free, and if you're not careful, one of the costs is latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luu goes on to write a lot about complexity and simplicity, and makes an interesting observation: the modern systems that fix the latency issue mostly do so not through removing complexity but by adding it. There was a lot of talk about complexity and simplicity at the time, because a huge number of software developers were working on another great tradeoff that had been made, this time in the datacenter: the widespread adoption of cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1995, when Wirth wrote his essay, if you wanted to run a new internet company, you could just get a computer and run with it. Amazon didn't launch until July of that year, but it was famously started out of Jeff Bezos' garage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The requirements for an internet company were simpler back then. The web wasn't some ubiquitous technology with total population penetration. There were only about 16 million people using it at the time; more people had an SNES than used the internet. Slashdot didn't exist. There was no real expectation of 5 9's 24/7/365 availability, and no opportunity to "go viral."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2010, this had changed. Sure, I guess you could still get Slashdotted then, but more relevantly, Twitter and Facebook could drive tons of traffic to you overnight. The number of internet users had ballooned to 2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run your company's software, you could build your own datacenter, but this is a complicated task requiring a lot of expertise; you need land, permits, contractors, etc. I wouldn't even know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could buy an existing datacenter, but you'd still need to manage power, backup generators/batteries, air conditioning, fire suppression, racks, maintenance, networking. Again, decades in the software industry, and I can barely build a competent list of requirements. It's a big investment, and there's a lot of opex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could rent a rack in a colo and focus on your compute needs, but those needs could change in an instant. If you plan out costs for 100,000 users and you never gain traction, you've overspent and are burning cash on pointless hardware you could be using to develop your product. If you get hit with a tidal wave of interest, you could be showing people the fail whale for years or miss your opportunity for success entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloud computing was the era's answer. By 2010, Amazon was out of Jeff's basement and running its own massive datacenters for their online operations. As Steve Yegge wrote in 2010, Bezos had distributed an influential API mandate in 2002 requiring all internal teams to make their services available via an API. By 2006, they had already built a platform that they felt they could release to paying customers in the form of EC2 and S3. AWS let you rent capacity in Amazon's datacenter through a web interface or via direct API calls, billed on granular timescales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each step in this pipeline imparts additional cost, but they're all pretty valuable, especially the last step. There are even more steps in that pipeline today, with fully managed services like RDS and IAM which abstract the management of software and Lambda which even further abstract your hardware requirements and allow you to scale (and pay) purely on utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though the cost to run software had gone up, the improved accessibility of cloud platforms and the reduction of risky capex led to an explosion in web software. All the while, hardware was racing ahead, making the rented capacity more powerful per unit cost and reducing the per-user cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not every "Wirth tradeoff" is sound engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in my career, I was working at a newspaper publisher owned by Condé Nast. I was the lead engineer on one of the company's more forward looking development projects, a Django application that managed local sports results data across dozens of regional newspapers. The application provided a single source of truth for very different users and use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reporters could add box scores and statistics on the go&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Their websites could display results, league tables, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The backend could publish feeds to syndicate into the print editions of each newspaper&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The print syndication system involved writing some pretty gnarly templates in order to generate feeds that could be understood by their newspaper printing systems. After a while, we noticed a problem. These templates were taking minutes to render and setting the database on fire every night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've been around the block in software, you might already know the issue. The templates were using an ORM which dynamically loaded foreign key fields on attribute access, so innocent looking loops were doing one database query per iteration. These were complex templates with many nested loops: they were sending hundreds of thousands of database queries per render, many of them just the same query over and over again from a different loop in a different part of the template.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could fix some of the terrible performance by pre-loading those fields with a join, but we had a lot of templates, and they were complex enough and the database large enough that this wasn't a realistic path to success. As Dan Luu concludes in his study on latency, the solution that worked required adding more complexity in the form of a smart caching layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although we didn't know we were making it when we started the template project, this was a "bad" Wirth tradeoff. It still had utility: instead of having to manage what data might be needed in what template carefully, we could grab a list of top level objects and let the ORM fetch the rest of the data we needed on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project started up quickly, but even at a pretty low scale of complexity, it became impossible to execute successfully. Before we realized what the problem was, we were using the convenience of these auto-loaded fields without understanding their true cost, and the software we built was a wasteful monstrosity as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see the same thing happening now but at broader scale with LLMs, and I feel myself sympathizing more and more with Wirth's cane shaking wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programming is the act of getting a computer to do something for you. Many people are discovering that for the first time, thanks to LLMs, they can ask a computer to do something for them, and it will actually go and do it. However, limiting yourself to programming only through this approach poses some problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While they might not be the unbound ecological disaster that many of their detractors claim they are, LLMs are still intensely computationally expensive. You can ask an AI what &lt;code&gt;2 * 3&lt;/code&gt; is and for the low price of several seconds of waiting, a few milliliters of water and enough power to watch 5% of a TikTok video on a television, it will tell you. But the computer you have in front of you can perform this calculation a billion times per second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the problem of my accidental database denial of service syndication feed was down to ignorance over the costs of ORM usage, it's pretty obvious that a similar kind of ignorance can lead to enormous unintended costs once we start integrating LLMs into our automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've seen a few instances of this out in the wild that lead me to believe that this trap might be particularly tricky to avoid. Despite the capacity for LLMs to educate, or simulate education, or at least point you towards related materials some of which may be real, that's not how laypeople use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They present the LLM with a problem and ask it solve that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One example of this is from myself, as this is how I used LLMs in my first go, too. I had a dump of recipes from a great but sadly unmaintained recipe site that I wanted to import into a self-hosted recipe management app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought "Well, this sounds tedious, let me ask an LLM to do this." So I pointed a local LLM to the specification for the destination format, and asked it to convert the files. It converted one file every 10 minutes, inaccurately and without proper formatting. It was slow and it produced trash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you see engineers heap praise on programming agents, this isn't how they are using them. You don't ask the LLM to perform a repetitive and precise task, you ask it to build a script that performs that task. Except in rare cases, this script does not itself use LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ironically, if you have the foresight to describe this problem to a major AI model and ask it how you should use an AI to solve it, this is exactly what it will tell you to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach subtly different from the way you might use LLMs for many other tasks, but it's crucial to getting results that reliably get a computer to do something for you. LLMs don't do reliable, they don't do repeatable. Building a program allows you to iterate on a deterministic solution with a stable source of truth, and you come away with an artifact that may or not be useless, but which actually works, and in my case converts 70 files/sec.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another example I came across was this twitter thread by BenjaminDEKR, which I saw being ridiculed on bsky. He asked his personal agent to remind him to get milk, and this led the agent to repeatedly ask Opus if it was daytime yet. Along with the context from his heartbeat file, this resulted in a $0.75 charge for each heartbeat, costing him almost $20 during a single night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What was the solution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you decide that for your purposes 00:00 is night and 08:00 is day and use a basic local &lt;code&gt;gettimeofday&lt;/code&gt; call to determine which span you're in. Maybe you're unsatisfied with anything other than astronomical day/night and can generate a sunrise/sunset table for the year using NOAA's unmaintained solar calculator to dynamically produce your day/night spans?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could do these things, but not if asking the LLM to solve problems is your problem solving approach. If asking an LLM is the only way you know how to solve problems, then you optimize the question asking by reducing heartbeat frequency and running on a cheaper model. Problem solved!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The overall concern is that having a magic box that gives you the answers ends up being a thought terminating solution to any problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wrote about the ecological impacts of AI, one of the non-ecological impacts I cited was the possibility that "AI erodes human skill." A recent release by research fellows at Anthropic, "How AI Impacts Skill Formation", suggests this fear isn't unfounded:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I was at a family gathering watching some of the kids go through a huge backlog of red envelopes that their grandparents had saved for them over various missed holidays. They were pulling out all of the cash, at which point they were going to tally it all up and split it evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the adults challenged them to come up with better counting strategies, one of them suggested they could throw all of the money on the floor, take a picture, and ask ChatGPT to tally it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The instincts are for people to get the AI to do work for them, not to learn from the AI how to do the work themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wirth's law posits that software can erase gains faster than hardware can make them, but I'm afraid the reality is much worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've studied computer science, you might have heard of a function called Busy Beaver. The name is unfortunately silly, but it's a fairly important thought experiment in computability. &lt;code&gt;BB(N)&lt;/code&gt; is defined as the maximum number of steps a terminating turing machine with N states can run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This function is known to be noncomputable, because any algorithm that could compute it would be able to solve the halting problem, which is known to be undecidable. &lt;code&gt;BB(1..3)&lt;/code&gt; were known in the 1960s to be 1, 6, and 21. In a pleasant bit of symmetry with Dan Luu's experiments, &lt;code&gt;BB(4)&lt;/code&gt; was discovered to be 107 in 1983, the same year his Apple 2e was built. In 2024, &lt;code&gt;BB(5)&lt;/code&gt; was proven to be 47,176,870.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As N grows, BB is known to eventually outgrow any computable sequence, including famous fast-growing sequences like TREE(). &lt;code&gt;BB(6)&lt;/code&gt; has a lower bound that is so large that it is impossible to explain how large it is to someone without a significant background in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software has an unprecedented capability to produce a correct answer in the most resource consuming way possible. Of course, producing incorrect answers or no answer at all is also an option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the apparent truth of Wirth's law, engineers have been actively battling against it for decades, but I worry that with LLMs we might have lost the war.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Am I just the latest in a long line of engineers who can't appreciate the newfound democratization of programming, or have we crossed into a "bad" Wirth tradeoff, where the growth curve of runtime complexity is something that hardware advancements cannot possibly dig us back out of?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you are wincing at the last name Reiser in the context of vaguely old computing, we are both of a very specific place and time, and I want you to know that Martin Reiser is not and has never been Hans Reiser.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A few CPU hardware bugs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Catherine (Whitequark)’s recent observations on poorly-engineered firmware reminded me of a few mistakes I’ve seen in vendors’ CPUs; some unimportant and others surprisingly bad. Since I’ve never seen these widely discussed, here’s some discussion and links to supporting evidence to make them more widely known, since I think they’re interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Intel’s misspelled CPUIDs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m aware of two situations where Intel have sold CPUs that report misspelled names in some of the strings returned by the &lt;code&gt;CPUID&lt;/code&gt; instruction. This seems embarrassing for an organization of Intel’s size, but probably doesn’t hurt anybody’s ability to use the CPUs in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GenuineIotel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A web search for “GenuineIotel” reveals some discussions regarding this apparent typo, where some processors such as the Xeon E3-1231 v3 return the string “GenuineIotel” (instead of the usual “GenuineIntel”) for the CPU manufacturer ID. This one is well-known enough to be mentioned in the list of manufacturer IDs on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible this misspelling is actually caused by some kind of random bit error, since the characters ’n’ and ‘o’ differ by only one bit; an unpredictable error that sets that bit could change &lt;code&gt;GenuineIntel&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;GenuineIotel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ore i5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another error that seems more likely to be human error in the CPU is in the Core i5-1245U CPU, which returns a processor brand string &lt;code&gt;Intel(R) ore(TM) i5-1245U&lt;/code&gt; which is simply missing the ‘C’ in &lt;code&gt;Core(TM) i5&lt;/code&gt;. Web searches for “Intel(R) ore(TM)” show a number of results which could be errors introduced by non-technical users attempting to copy down text from their screen when asking for tech support, but the Ubuntu certified configuration of the Dell Latitude 5430 with this CPU attests to this error actually being present in at least some machines using that CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible this misspelling is not part of the physical CPU design and is instead part of the system firmware because at least on many AMD CPUs the CPU name is normally set by the system firmware. Probably either the CPU design or its microcode encode this misspelling, or Intel’s firmware package that vendors use is the ultimate source. In either case, it seems embarrassing for them that such an error made it out into machines purchased by members of the public because it seems very likely to be the result of human error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ITE’s pipeline bug&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is an actual hardware bug that I discovered at work, but in an embedded processor which most people will never see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ITE Tech is a Taiwanese chip company that sells a variety of specialized ICs, including a selection of PC embedded controllers (which are used for tasks like making the keyboard work and managing battery charging in most laptops). IT81202 is one of those, with on-chip peripherals for communicating with an x86 processor and plenty of memory for private use by its RISC-V CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out there’s a pipeline bug in the IT81202 CPU, where instructions modifying some registers immediately following a multiply (&lt;code&gt;mul&lt;/code&gt; instruction) may have no effect. The workaround for this is to cripple the system, telling your compiler that the CPU doesn’t support multiplication or division instructions. Some of the performance can be regained by providing implementations of the library functions that provide integer multiply/divide operations that work in terms of the &lt;code&gt;mul&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; instructions, which works because inserting no-op instructions after them prevents the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, this issue doesn’t seem as embarrassing as Intel’s wrong CPUIDs. Pipelined CPUs are hard to build, and at the time they designed the IT81202 CPU RISC-V wasn’t widely used in industry yet so they probably had a pretty immature core implementation. In addition, that’s an embedded processor which very few people will ever need to write software for so an invasive workaround like that isn’t a big deal. This one seems more like a cautionary tale to be aware of than any reason to mock the vendor!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Owning a $5M data center&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days it seems you need a trillion fake dollars, or lunch with politicians to get your own data center. They may help, but they’re not required. At comma we’ve been running our own data center for years. All of our model training, metrics, and data live in our own data center in our own office. Having your own data center is cool, and in this blog post I will describe how ours works, so you can be inspired to have your own data center too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why no cloud?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your business relies on compute, and you run that compute in the cloud, you are putting a lot of trust in your cloud provider. Cloud companies generally make onboarding very easy, and offboarding very difficult. If you are not vigilant you will sleepwalk into a situation of high cloud costs and no way out. If you want to control your own destiny, you must run your own compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-reliance is great, but there are other benefits to running your own compute. It inspires good engineering. Maintaining a data center is much more about solving real-world challenges. The cloud requires expertise in company-specific APIs and billing systems. A data center requires knowledge of Watts, bits, and FLOPs. I know which one I rather think about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoiding the cloud for ML also creates better incentives for engineers. Engineers generally want to improve things. In ML many problems go away by just using more compute. In the cloud that means improvements are just a budget increase away. This locks you into inefficient and expensive solutions. Instead, when all you have available is your current compute, the quickest improvements are usually speeding up your code, or fixing fundamental issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally there’s cost, owning a data center can be far cheaper than renting in the cloud. Especially if your compute or storage needs are fairly consistent, which tends to be true if you are in the business of training or running models. In comma’s case I estimate we’ve spent ~5M on our data center, and we would have spent 25M+ had we done the same things in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s all needed?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our data center is pretty simple. It’s maintained and built by only a couple engineers and technicians. Your needs may be slightly different, our implementation should provide useful context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Power&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run servers you need power. We currently use about 450kW at max. Operating a data center exposes you to many fun engineering challenges, but procuring power is not one of them. San Diego power cost is over 40c/kWh, ~3x the global average. It’s a ripoff, and overpriced simply due to political dysfunction. We spent $540,112 on power in 2025, a big part of the data center cost. In a future blog post I hope I can tell you about how we produce our own power and you should too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cooling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data centers need cool dry air. Typically this is achieved with a CRAC system, but they are power-hungry. San Diego has a mild climate and we opted for pure outside air cooling. This gives us less control of the temperature and humidity, but uses only a couple dozen kW. We have dual 48” intake fans and dual 48” exhaust fans to keep the air cool. To ensure low humidity (&amp;lt;45%) we use recirculating fans to mix hot exhaust air with the intake air. One server is connected to several sensors and runs a PID loop to control the fans to optimize the temperature and humidity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Servers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The majority of our current compute is 600 GPUs in 75 TinyBox Pro machines. They were built in-house, which saves us money and ensures they suit our needs. Our self-built machines fail at a similar rate to pre-built machines we’ve bought, but we’re capable of fixing them ourselves quickly. They have 2 CPUs and 8 GPUs each, and work as both training machines and general compute workers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For data storage we have a few racks of Dell machines (R630 and R730). They are filled with SSDs for a total of ~4PB of storage. We use SSDs for reliability and speed. Our main storage arrays have no redundancy and each node needs to be able to saturate the network bandwidth with random access reads. For the storage machines this means reading up to 20Gbps of each 80TB chunk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than storage and compute machines we have several one-off machines to run services. This includes a router, climate controller, data ingestion machine, storage master servers, metric servers, redis servers, and a few more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running the network requires switches, but at this scale we don’t need to bother with complicated switch topologies. We have 3 100Gbps interconnected Z9264F switches, which serve as the main ethernet network. We have two more infiniband switches to interconnect the 2 tinybox pro groups for training all-reduce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To effectively use all these compute and storage machines you need some infra. At this scale, services don’t need redundancy to achieve 99% uptime. We use a single master for all services, which makes things pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All servers get ubuntu installed with pxeboot and are managed by salt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Distributed storage: minikeyvalue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of our storage arrays use mkv. The main array is 3PB of non-redundant storage hosting our driving data we train on. We can read from this array at ~1TB/s, which means we can train directly on the raw data without caching. Redundancy is not needed since no specific data is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have an additional ~300TB non-redundant array to cache intermediate processed results. And lastly, we have a redundant mkv storage array to store all of our trained models and training metrics. Each of these 3 arrays have a separate single master server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Workload management: slurm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use slurm to manage the compute nodes, and compute jobs. We schedule two types of distributed compute. Pytorch training jobs, and miniray workers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Distributed training: pytorch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To train models across multiple GPU nodes we use &lt;code&gt;torch.distributed&lt;/code&gt; FSDP. We have 2 separate training partitions, each intra-connected with Infiniband for training across machines. We wrote our own training framework which handles the training loop boilerplate, but it’s mostly just pytorch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a custom model experiment tracking service (similar to wandb or tensorboard). It provides a dashboard for tracking experiments, and shows custom metrics and reports. It is also the interface for the mkv storage array that hosts the model weights. The training runs store the model weights there with a uuid, and they are available to download for whoever needs to run them. The metrics and reports for our latest models are also open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Distributed compute: miniray&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides training we have many other compute tasks. This can be anything from running tests, running models, pre-processing data, or even running agent rollouts for on-policy training. We wrote a lightweight open-source task scheduler called miniray that allows you to run arbitrary python code on idle machines. This is a simpler version of dask, with a focus on extreme simplicity. Slurm will schedule any idle machine to be an active miniray worker, and accept pending tasks. All the task information is hosted in a central redis server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miniray workers with GPUs will spin up a triton inference server to run model inference with dynamic batching. A miniray worker can thus easily and efficiently run any of the models hosted in the model mkv storage array.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miniray makes it extremely easy to scale parallel tasks to hundreds of machines. For example, the controls challenge record was set by just having ~1hr of access to our data center with miniray.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Code NFS monorepo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All our code is in a monorepo that we have cloned on our workstations. This monorepo is kept small (&amp;lt;3GB), so it can easily be copied around. When a training job or miniray distributed job is started on any workstation, the local monorepo is cached on a shared NFS drive including all the local changes. Training jobs and miniray tasks are pointed towards this cache, such that all distributed work uses the exact codebase you have locally. Even all the python packages are identical, UV on the worker/trainer syncs the packages specified in the monorepo before starting any work. This entire process of copying your entire local codebase and syncing all the packages takes only ~2s, and is well worth it to prevent the issues mismatches can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;All together now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most complex thing we do at comma is train driving models on-policy, these training runs require training data to be generated during training by running simulated driving rollouts with the most recent model weights. Here’s a real-world command we just used to train such a model. This training run uses all of the infrastructure described above. While only this small command is needed to kick everything off, it orchestrates a lot of moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Owning a $5M data center&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days it seems you need a trillion fake dollars, or lunch with politicians to get your own data center. They may help, but they’re not required. At comma we’ve been running our own data center for years. All of our model training, metrics, and data live in our own data center in our own office. Having your own data center is cool, and in this blog post I will describe how ours works, so you can be inspired to have your own data center too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why no cloud?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your business relies on compute, and you run that compute in the cloud, you are putting a lot of trust in your cloud provider. Cloud companies generally make onboarding very easy, and offboarding very difficult. If you are not vigilant you will sleepwalk into a situation of high cloud costs and no way out. If you want to control your own destiny, you must run your own compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-reliance is great, but there are other benefits to running your own compute. It inspires good engineering. Maintaining a data center is much more about solving real-world challenges. The cloud requires expertise in company-specific APIs and billing systems. A data center requires knowledge of Watts, bits, and FLOPs. I know which one I rather think about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoiding the cloud for ML also creates better incentives for engineers. Engineers generally want to improve things. In ML many problems go away by just using more compute. In the cloud that means improvements are just a budget increase away. This locks you into inefficient and expensive solutions. Instead, when all you have available is your current compute, the quickest improvements are usually speeding up your code, or fixing fundamental issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally there’s cost, owning a data center can be far cheaper than renting in the cloud. Especially if your compute or storage needs are fairly consistent, which tends to be true if you are in the business of training or running models. In comma’s case I estimate we’ve spent ~5M on our data center, and we would have spent 25M+ had we done the same things in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s all needed?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our data center is pretty simple. It’s maintained and built by only a couple engineers and technicians. Your needs may be slightly different, our implementation should provide useful context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Power&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run servers you need power. We currently use about 450kW at max. Operating a data center exposes you to many fun engineering challenges, but procuring power is not one of them. San Diego power cost is over 40c/kWh, ~3x the global average. It’s a ripoff, and overpriced simply due to political dysfunction. We spent $540,112 on power in 2025, a big part of the data center cost. In a future blog post I hope I can tell you about how we produce our own power and you should too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cooling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data centers need cool dry air. Typically this is achieved with a CRAC system, but they are power-hungry. San Diego has a mild climate and we opted for pure outside air cooling. This gives us less control of the temperature and humidity, but uses only a couple dozen kW. We have dual 48” intake fans and dual 48” exhaust fans to keep the air cool. To ensure low humidity (&amp;lt;45%) we use recirculating fans to mix hot exhaust air with the intake air. One server is connected to several sensors and runs a PID loop to control the fans to optimize the temperature and humidity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Servers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The majority of our current compute is 600 GPUs in 75 TinyBox Pro machines. They were built in-house, which saves us money and ensures they suit our needs. Our self-built machines fail at a similar rate to pre-built machines we’ve bought, but we’re capable of fixing them ourselves quickly. They have 2 CPUs and 8 GPUs each, and work as both training machines and general compute workers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For data storage we have a few racks of Dell machines (R630 and R730). They are filled with SSDs for a total of ~4PB of storage. We use SSDs for reliability and speed. Our main storage arrays have no redundancy and each node needs to be able to saturate the network bandwidth with random access reads. For the storage machines this means reading up to 20Gbps of each 80TB chunk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than storage and compute machines we have several one-off machines to run services. This includes a router, climate controller, data ingestion machine, storage master servers, metric servers, redis servers, and a few more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running the network requires switches, but at this scale we don’t need to bother with complicated switch topologies. We have 3 100Gbps interconnected Z9264F switches, which serve as the main ethernet network. We have two more infiniband switches to interconnect the 2 tinybox pro groups for training all-reduce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To effectively use all these compute and storage machines you need some infra. At this scale, services don’t need redundancy to achieve 99% uptime. We use a single master for all services, which makes things pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All servers get ubuntu installed with pxeboot and are managed by salt.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;ElCity is a small, turn-based city builder that runs entirely inside Emacs. The UI is ASCII-based and optimized for terminal Emacs sessions. The core simulation is deterministic and pure, while the UI handles rendering and input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an excercise in implementing the “functional core / imperative shell” architecture in a moderately sized project that with a developed UI. Every tile type is defined through a DSL, with a strong separation between state and effects. Most functions in the core are either pure or pure-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benefits to this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;easy to debug&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;scalable in terms of code: reduced cognitive load on both people and LLMs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;easy UX/UI as state is always localized&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;easy to extend (with some discipline)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;easy to autotest&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Emacs 30.1+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional: Eask for dependency management&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clone the repository and add it to your Emacs load path. Example with &lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(use-package elcity
  :load-path "/path/to/elcity"
  :commands (elcity-start))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are not using &lt;code&gt;use-package&lt;/code&gt;, add the directory to &lt;code&gt;load-path&lt;/code&gt;
  and require the entry point:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/elcity")
(require 'elcity)
(elcity-start)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the project root:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make run&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or from Emacs: &lt;code&gt;M-x elcity-start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The game is turn-based. Press &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;to advance one turn.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Funds increase each turn by: (Population / 2) + (Commercial level + Industrial level).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;City Hall is the source of road connectivity and is unique and non-demolishable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Roads are only connected if they trace through other roads to City Hall.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Power plants provide a Manhattan-radius of 6 tiles.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zones grow by 1 level per turn if powered and road-adjacent.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zones decay by 1 level per turn if they lose power or road adjacency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum zone level is 3.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Residential (R) supplies Workers in a radius and dislikes Pollution.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Industrial (I) supplies Goods and Pollution and requires Workers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commercial (C) requires Workers and Goods.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;select Residential and place once&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;select Commercial and place once&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;select Industrial and place once&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;select Road and place once&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;select Power plant and place once&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;select City Hall and place once&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SPC&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;RET&lt;/code&gt;place selected tool at cursor&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;demolish at cursor&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;advance one turn&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arrow keys move the cursor&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install from source (latest features, recommended for development)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot.git
cd nanobot
pip install -e .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install with uv (stable, fast)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv tool install nanobot-ai&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install from PyPI (stable)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install nanobot-ai&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set your API key in &lt;code&gt;~/.nanobot/config.json&lt;/code&gt;.
Get API keys: OpenRouter (LLM) · Brave Search (optional, for web search)
You can also change the model to &lt;code&gt;minimax/minimax-m2&lt;/code&gt; for lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Initialize&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;nanobot onboard&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Configure (&lt;code&gt;~/.nanobot/config.json&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "apiKey": "sk-or-v1-xxx"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"
    }
  },
  "tools": {
    "web": {
      "search": {
        "apiKey": "BSA-xxx"
      }
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Chat&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;nanobot agent -m "What is 2+2?"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it! You have a working AI assistant in 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run nanobot with your own local models using vLLM or any OpenAI-compatible server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Start your vLLM server&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --port 8000&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Configure (&lt;code&gt;~/.nanobot/config.json&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "providers": {
    "vllm": {
      "apiKey": "dummy",
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:8000/v1"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Chat&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;nanobot agent -m "Hello from my local LLM!"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;apiKey&lt;/code&gt; can be any non-empty string for local servers that don't require authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talk to your nanobot through Telegram, WhatsApp, or Feishu — anytime, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Channel&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Setup&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Telegram&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Easy (just a token)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Medium (scan QR)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Feishu&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Medium (app credentials)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Telegram (Recommended)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Create a bot&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open Telegram, search &lt;code&gt;@BotFather&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send &lt;code&gt;/newbot&lt;/code&gt;, follow prompts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy the token&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Configure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "allowFrom": ["YOUR_USER_ID"]
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your user ID from&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@userinfobot&lt;/code&gt;on Telegram.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;nanobot gateway&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Requires Node.js ≥18.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Link device&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;nanobot channels login
# Scan QR with WhatsApp → Settings → Linked Devices&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Configure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "channels": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowFrom": ["+1234567890"]
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Run (two terminals)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Terminal 1
nanobot channels login

# Terminal 2
nanobot gateway&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Feishu (飞书)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uses WebSocket long connection — no public IP required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install nanobot-ai[feishu]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Create a Feishu bot&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visit Feishu Open Platform&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a new app → Enable Bot capability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Permissions: Add &lt;code&gt;im:message&lt;/code&gt;(send messages)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Events: Add &lt;code&gt;im.message.receive_v1&lt;/code&gt;(receive messages)&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Select Long Connection mode (requires running nanobot first to establish connection)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get App ID and App Secret from "Credentials &amp;amp; Basic Info"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Publish the app&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Configure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "channels": {
    "feishu": {
      "enabled": true,
      "appId": "cli_xxx",
      "appSecret": "xxx",
      "encryptKey": "",
      "verificationToken": "",
      "allowFrom": []
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;encryptKey&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;verificationToken&lt;/code&gt;are optional for Long Connection mode.&lt;code&gt;allowFrom&lt;/code&gt;: Leave empty to allow all users, or add&lt;code&gt;["ou_xxx"]&lt;/code&gt;to restrict access.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;nanobot gateway&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[!TIP] Feishu uses WebSocket to receive messages — no webhook or public IP needed!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Config file: &lt;code&gt;~/.nanobot/config.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq provides free voice transcription via Whisper. If configured, Telegram voice messages will be automatically transcribed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot&lt;/code&gt; flag mounts your local config directory into the container, so your config and workspace persist across container restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build and run nanobot in a container:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Build the image
docker build -t nanobot .

# Initialize config (first time only)
docker run -v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot --rm nanobot onboard

# Edit config on host to add API keys
vim ~/.nanobot/config.json

# Run gateway (connects to Telegram/WhatsApp)
docker run -v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot -p 18790:18790 nanobot gateway

# Or run a single command
docker run -v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot --rm nanobot agent -m "Hello!"
docker run -v ~/.nanobot:/root/.nanobot --rm nanobot status&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;From magic to malware: How OpenClaw's agent skills become an attack surface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Jason Meller&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;February 2, 2026 - 8 min&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Related Categories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I published a post about why OpenClaw feels like a portal to the future, and why that future is scary in a very specific way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The short version: agent gateways that act like OpenClaw are powerful because they have real access to your files, your tools, your browser, your terminals, and often a long-term “memory” file that captures how you think and what you’re building. That combination is exactly what modern infostealers are designed to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is the uncomfortable, “and then it happened” follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it’s not just that agents can be dangerous once they’re installed. The ecosystem that distributes their capabilities and skill registries has already become an attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are experimenting with OpenClaw, do not do it on a company device. Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my first post, I described OpenClaw as a kind of Faustian bargain. It is compelling precisely because it has real access to your local machine, your apps, your browser sessions, your files, and often long-term memory. That same access means there isn’t yet a safe way to run it on a machine that holds corporate credentials or has access to production systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have already run OpenClaw on a work device, treat it as a potential incident and engage your security team immediately. Do not wait for symptoms. Pause work on that machine and follow your organization’s incident response process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Skills are just markdown. That’s the problem.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the OpenClaw ecosystem, a “skill” is often a markdown file: a page of instructions that tells an agent how to do a specialized task. In practice, that markdown can include links, copy-and-paste commands, and tool call recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sounds harmless until you remember how humans, and agents, actually consume documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Here’s the prerequisite.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Run this command.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Install the core dependency.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Paste this in Terminal.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Markdown isn’t “content” in an agent ecosystem. Markdown is an installer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A dangerous misconception: “MCP makes skills safe”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people assume the Model Context Protocol layer makes this safer, because tools can be exposed through a structured interface, with explicit user consent and authorization controls depending on the host and server implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But skills do not need to use MCP at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Agent Skills specification places no restrictions on the markdown body, and skills can include whatever instructions will “help agents perform the task,” including copy and paste terminal commands. And skills can also bundle scripts alongside the markdown, which means execution can happen outside the MCP tool boundary entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if your security model is “MCP will gate tool calls,” you can still lose to a malicious skill that simply routes around MCP through social engineering, direct shell instructions, or bundled code. MCP can be part of a safe system, but it is not a safety guarantee by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, this is not unique to OpenClaw. “Skills” are increasingly portable because many agents are adopting the open Agent Skills format, in which a skill is a folder centered on a SKILL.md file with metadata and freeform instructions, and it can also bundle scripts and other resources. Even OpenAI’s documentation describes the same basic shape: a SKILL.md file plus optional scripts and assets. That means a malicious “skill” is not just an OpenClaw problem. It is a distribution mechanism that can travel across any agent ecosystem that supports the same standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I found: The top downloaded skill was a malware delivery vehicle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While browsing ClawHub (I won’t link it for obvious reasons), I noticed the top downloaded skill at the time was a “Twitter” skill. It looked normal: description, intended use, an overview, the kind of thing you’d expect to install without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the very first thing it did was introduce a “required dependency” named “openclaw-core,” along with platform-specific install steps. Those steps included convenient links (“here”, “this link”) that appeared to be normal documentation pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both links led to malicious infrastructure. The flow was classic staged delivery:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The skill’s overview told you to install a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The link led to a staging page designed to get the agent to run a command.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That command decoded an obfuscated payload and executed it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The payload fetched a second-stage script.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The script downloaded and ran a binary, including removing macOS quarantine attributes to ensure macOS’s built-in anti-malware system, Gatekeeper, doesn’t scan it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m intentionally not pasting the exact commands or URLs here. The mechanics are unfortunately straightforward, and repeating them helps attackers more than it helps defenders. The key point is that this was not “a suspicious link.” This was a complete execution chain disguised as setup instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Confirmed: Infostealing malware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I downloaded the final binary safely and submitted it to VirusTotal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The verdict was not ambiguous. It was flagged as macOS infostealing malware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the type of malware that doesn’t just “infect your computer.” It raids everything valuable on that device:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Browser sessions and cookies&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Saved credentials and autofill data&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Developer tokens and API keys&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SSH keys&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloud credentials&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Anything else that can be turned into an account takeover&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person installing agent skills, you are exactly the kind of person whose machine is worth stealing from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;This wasn’t an isolated case. It was a campaign.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After I shared this internally, broader reporting surfaced, putting the scale into focus: hundreds of OpenClaw skills were reportedly involved in distributing macOS malware via ClickFix-style instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That detail matters because it confirms what this really is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a one-off malicious upload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A deliberate strategy: use “skills” as the distribution channel, and “prerequisites” as the social engineering wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When ‘helpful’ becomes hostile in an agent world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve spent years learning that package managers and open-source registries can become supply chain attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent skill registries are the next chapter, except that the “package” is documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that makes the attack path even smoother:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;People don’t expect a markdown file to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;People are trained to follow setup steps quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;People trust “top downloaded” as a proxy for legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And in agent ecosystems, the line between reading instructions and executing them collapses.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if an agent can’t run shell commands directly, it can still do something dangerous: it can normalize risky behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can confidently summarize a malicious prerequisite as “the standard install step.” It can encourage you to paste a one-liner. It can reduce hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if your agent can execute local commands, then a malicious skill isn’t “bad content.” It’s remote execution wrapped in friendly docs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you should do right now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;If you are using OpenClaw or any skill registry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not run this on a company device. There isn’t a safe way to do it. If you already did, or you ran any “install” commands from a skill, engage your security team immediately and treat it as a potential compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Stop using the device for sensitive work.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rotate sessions and secrets first: browser sessions, developer tokens, SSH keys, cloud console sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Review recent sign-ins for email, source control, cloud, CI/CD, and admin consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you experiment anyway, use an isolated machine with no corporate access and no saved credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;If you run a skill registry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are operating an app store. Assume it will be abused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Scan for one-liner installers, encoded payloads, quarantine removal, password-protected archives.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add provenance and publisher reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Put warnings and friction on external links and install steps.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Review top-ranked skills and remove malicious ones fast.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Markdown is executable intent here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;If you build agent frameworks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assume skills will be weaponized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Default-deny shell execution.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sandbox access to browsers, keychains, and credential stores.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use permissions that are specific, time-bound, and revocable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add friction for remote code and command execution.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Log provenance and actions end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designing for the future: The trust layer agents require&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the clearest proof yet of the point I made in my earlier post. OpenClaw is powerful because it collapses the distance between intent and execution. That is the magic. It also introduces significant risk. When capabilities are distributed as skills and installed via documentation, the registry becomes a supply chain, and the easiest install path becomes the attacker’s favorite path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is not to stop building agents. The answer is to build the missing trust layer around them. Skills need provenance. Execution needs mediation. Permissions need to be specific, revocable, and continuously enforced, not granted once and forgotten. If agents are going to act on our behalf, credentials and sensitive actions cannot be “grabbed” by whatever code happens to run. They need to be brokered, governed, and audited in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly why we need that next layer: when “skills” become the supply chain, the only safe future is one in which every agent has its own identity and has the minimum authority it needs right now, with access that is time-bound, revocable, and attributable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Company as Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reimagining organisational structure for the digital age.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, as I sat across from our ISO 27001 information security auditor, watching them strenuously work through our documentation, a thought struck me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here we are, a software company, with nearly all of our operations running in interconnected digital systems, yet the core of our business—our policies, procedures, and organisational structure—is a basic collection of documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It just felt ironic. We use advanced tools to automate compliance checks, store our code in version-controlled repositories, and manage our infrastructure as code. However, when describing and managing our company, we resort to digital paper and tidbits of info distributed across people in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The disconnect became increasingly apparent as I reflected on our day-to-day process: 90% of our products, documents, communication, and decision-making live in digital channels. That’s data. It lives in the cloud, spread over SaaS solutions that specialise in handling individual work processes—all systems with robust APIs and programmatic access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the centre of it all sits a lonely island of documents: our ambitions, goals, policies and formal structures. And I think those are pretty important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our security posture was solid before we even considered ISO 27001 because we’d already worked hard to comply with our customer’s requirements. Between collecting evidence for controls, arguing about and updating policy wording, document review, and the actual audit, we spent hundreds of additional person-hours that could’ve otherwise been spent creating great products for our users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A missing link&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we desire operational data to be so rich, why do we accept organisational data to be so sparse? We’ve revolutionised how we handle infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), how we manage deployments with GitOps, and how we handle security with Policy as Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when representing our organisation (the beating heart of our operations), we apply old-school methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine if we could represent our entire organisational structure programmatically instead—not a static picture, but a living, breathing digital representation of our company that can be versioned, queried, tested, and automatically verified. A system where policy changes could be tracked as code changes, where compliance could be continuously monitored, and where the relationships between people, processes and technology could be explicitly mapped and understood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thinking bigger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing solutions like HRIS systems manage people data but struggle with policy relationships. GRC tools track compliance but rarely connect meaningfully to organisational structure. I’m proposing we think bigger. It’s about creating a holistic, programmatic representation of the entire organisation: a “company manifest” that serves as a single source of truth for organisational structure, policy, and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider how helpful this might be for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compliance audits: Instead of manually piecing together evidence from various systems, auditors could query the company manifest directly, with clear traceability between policies and their implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Policy changes: Updates could be version-controlled, and automated impact analysis could show which teams and processes would be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Organisational design: Leaders could model structural changes in a “staging environment” before implementing them, gaining a better understanding of how changes cause ripple effects throughout the company.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why isn’t this a thing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As this idea swirls around in my mind, I find more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried this yet? If not, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it because organisations are inherently too complex and dynamic to be represented as code? If so, that seems at odds with regulation and standards, where we expect corporate activities to be so uniform and procedural that we can reliably stamp them as compliant, non-compliant, legal, or illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it because we haven’t yet found the right abstraction level—the equivalent of what Infrastructure as Code did for system administration?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tools and concepts exist: Graph databases for representing organisational relationships, domain-specific languages for describing business rules, and API-first architectures for integration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe what’s missing is a framework to bring these ideas together in a way that’s powerful enough to be useful and simple enough to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Putting it into practice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s think about how this could work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section, I’ll fantasise about what I would want from “Company as Code.” Then, I’ll map that to some system components that could address those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an engineer and business stakeholder, I would want a company model to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Queryable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system must trace relationships between people, policies, and systems—similar to code dependency tracking. Users should easily see the organisation from different angles, such as which people are affected by a policy and who owns it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Versionable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explicit tracking of organisational changes, including who made them, what changed, and why. This is crucial for audits and understanding organisational evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Integrated&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seamless data exchange with existing tools (Azure, Slack, etc.) to maintain an up-to-date organisational picture and enforce tool configurations based on policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Testable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A “staging environment” where organisational changes can be modeled before implementation, supporting automated tests for individual rules and controls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Accessible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though powered by code, the interface should be intuitive enough for non-technical leaders to use effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bringing this vision to life requires several puzzle pieces. Each component must address specific requirements to approximate something that can be powerful while being relatively simple to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A declarative language for organisations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform, let’s imagine a declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL) that reads naturally while expressing a formal structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic syntax follows a clear pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;EntityType "Identifier" {
    References = AnotherEntity.Identifier
    Attribute = Value
    ListAttribute = [
        "Item One",
        "Item Two"
    ]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A type, unique identifier, and set of attributes define each entity. Entities can reference each other using dot notation, creating a web of relationships that forms our organisational graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Specifying an organisation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's walk through how you could define a small engineering team in this language:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First, let’s define the roles that exist in the organisation:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Role "SoftwareEngineer" {
    Responsibilities = [
        "Write clean, maintainable code",
        "Participate in code reviews",
        "Document technical decisions"
    ]
}

Role "EngineeringManager" {
    Responsibilities = [
        "Provide technical leadership",
        "Conduct performance reviews",
        "Manage team resources"
    ]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next, we’ll create an organisational unit for our team:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;OrganisationalUnit "EngineeringTeam" {
    Department = "Engineering"
    CostCenter = "ENG-001"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With these structures in place, we can define the actual people and their relationships:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Person "AliceSmith" {
    FullName = "Alice Smith"
    Role = Role.EngineeringManager
    Unit = OrganisationalUnit.EngineeringTeam
    Email = "alice.smith@company.com"
}

Person "BobJohnson" {
    FullName = "Bob Johnson"
    Role = Role.SoftwareEngineer
    Unit = OrganisationalUnit.EngineeringTeam
    Manager = Person.AliceSmith
    Email = "bob.johnson@company.com"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Policy definitions create a framework for compliance:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;PolicyGroup "SecurityPolicies" {
    Owner = Person.AliceSmith
}

PolicyRule "MFARequired" {
    Group = PolicyGroup.SecurityPolicies
    Enforcement = "Mandatory"
    ComplianceLevel = "Critical"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, we can map these policies to external requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ExternalRequirement "ISO27001_A9_4_1" {
    Standard = "ISO 27001:2013"
    Control = "A.9.4.1"
    ComplianceLevel = "Mandatory"
}

ComplianceMapping "MFACompliance" {
    Requirement = ExternalRequirement.ISO27001_A9_4_1
    ImplementingPolicies = [PolicyRule.MFARequired]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This declarative approach allows us to build a complete picture of our organisation, from high-level structures to individual policies and their regulatory implications. Each definition is clear and self-documenting, while the references between entities create a graph of relationships that can be analysed, validated, and used to automate organisational processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a representation like this, we benefit from organising definitions into logical files and directories, treating organisational changes like code changes: versioned, reviewed, and validated before application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This enables practices like reviewing changes through pull requests, testing policy modifications before rollout, and automatically generating compliance documentation while tracking the evolution of organisational structures over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Building a model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform work with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to determine deployment order, an organisation's structure is inherently more interconnected. People manage other people, policies reference activities that refer back to policies, and teams have complex interdependencies. This calls for an undirected cyclic graph model to represent these rich relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public record Node(
    string Id,          // e.g. "Person.AliceSmith"
    string Type,        // e.g. "Person", "PolicyRule"
    List&amp;lt;Edge&amp;gt; Relations = null
);

public record Edge(
    string FromId, 
    string ToId,
    string RelationType, // e.g. "ManagedBy"
);

public class CompanyGraph
{
    private Dictionary&amp;lt;string, Node&amp;gt; _nodes = new();
    private List&amp;lt;Edge&amp;gt; _edges = new();

    public void AddNode(string id, string type) =&amp;gt;
        _nodes[id] = new Node(id, type);

    public void AddRelation(string fromId, string toId, string type)
    {
        var edge = new Edge(fromId, toId, type);
        _edges.Add(edge);
        (_nodes[fromId].Relations ??= new()).Add(edge);
        (_nodes[toId].Relations ??= new()).Add(edge);
    }

    // Example: Find all requirements impacted by changing a policy
    public IEnumerable&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt; GetImpactedRequirements(string policyId) =&amp;gt;
        _nodes[policyId].Relations
            .Where(e =&amp;gt; e.RelationType == "ImplementsRequirement")
            .Select(e =&amp;gt; _nodes[e.FromId == policyId ? e.ToId : e.FromId])
            .Where(req =&amp;gt; req.Type == "ExternalRequirement");
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The example above shows a naive implementation of a queryable graph structure based on a declarative DSL. This representation makes it easier to answer questions requiring multiple references in the structure, such as "Which external requirements would be affected if we changed our MFA policy?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bridging models and reality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A DSL can define an organisation's structure and rules, but the model must be connected to real-world data to be useful. This requires a storage strategy that can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Persist the organisational graph itself&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Store data associated with graph entities (like evidence)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enable validation of considered changes&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A way to deliver this at scale would be to combine several data stores: A graph database for the organisational model, a relational database for associated data, and an event store for audit trail and change tracking. If you wanted to start small, you could serialise all this information to your local filesystem instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To activate external data, we would need an integration framework with a plug-in architecture to bridge the organisational model and production systems. This would handle three key aspects: (1) data collection from integrated systems like GitHub or Azure, mapping evidence to nodes in our graph; (2) policy validation that programmatically checks collected evidence against rules; and (3) policy enforcement where organisational changes automatically trigger updates across connected systems—from employee provisioning to access permission changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DSL would supply this functionality using built-in modules or user-supplied plug-ins to perform the work needed to interact with other systems. Let’s imagine a Control entity in the DSL which uses a custom script to perform routine checks on MFA usage and links results to the compliance mapping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Control "MFAMonitoring" {
    Implements = ComplianceMapping.MFACompliance
    
    Verify {
        Script = "Security/mfa-checks.js"
        Methods = [
            "allUsersHaveMfaEnabled"
        ]
        Frequency = "Daily"
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then in &lt;code&gt;security/mfa-checks.js&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export async function allUsersHaveMfaEnabled() {
    const users = await myAuthClient.listUsers()
    return users.every(user =&amp;gt; user.mfaEnabled)
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution should be open and extendable to maximise its usefulness, allowing for custom integrations, validations, and automation. Terraform does a good job of this with its “Providers” plug-in architecture, although integrations to inspect and modify data in corporate systems might need to support more custom scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For organisations wanting to test this approach, you could start small:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Model just your organisational structure and reporting lines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add key policies and compliance mappings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Begin connecting to your most critical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Making it shine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A code-based declaration of an organisation offers powerful capabilities for technologists, but we also need to acknowledge that many business stakeholders don’t “think in code”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The elegance of a DSL doesn’t have to be limited to those most comfortable with text editors and version control software. A genuinely accessible “Company as Code” solution must connect a programmatic representation and the business users who make daily decisions about organisation structure, policy and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This could be solved with a low-code / no-code interface where:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Business leaders drag and drop organisational entities and reporting structures while the system generates code declarations behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compliance officers use simple forms to define policies and instantly visualise which parts of the business they affect. When regulations change, they can quickly identify gaps or conflicts through visual highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Technologists keep the codebase organised and provide data integrations and tools to implement policy in external systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With an approach like this, we can maintain the rigour of the code model while making it accessible to everyone. Changes through the interface update the underlying code, preserving that single source of truth that can be versioned and validated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Final notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the technical feasibility, the real promise lies in the organisational benefits: faster audits, clearer decision-making, and better understanding of changes' impact before implementing them. Hundreds of hours spent on compliance documentation could instead be invested in creating value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, I hoped to establish that a codification of organisational structure is missing and that it’s buildable. Practical? Don’t know. Viable? I don’t have the answer. Buildable, though? Yes. I believe so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Spotlighting The World Factbook as We Bid a Fond Farewell (via) Somewhat devastating news today from CIA:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One of CIA’s oldest and most recognizable intelligence publications, The World Factbook, has sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's not even a hint as to why they decided to stop maintaining this publication, which has been their most useful public-facing initiative since 1971 and a cornerstone of the public internet since 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a bizarre act of cultural vandalism they've not just removed the entire site (including the archives of previous versions) but they've also set every single page to be a 302 redirect to their closure announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Factbook has been released into the public domain since the start. There's no reason not to continue to serve archived versions - a banner at the top of the page saying it's no longer maintained would be much better than removing all of that valuable content entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Up until 2020 the CIA published annual zip file archives of the entire site. Those are available (along with the rest of the Factbook) on the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I downloaded the 384MB &lt;code&gt;.zip&lt;/code&gt; file for the year 2020 and extracted it into a new GitHub repository, simonw/cia-world-factbook-2020. I've enabled GitHub Pages for that repository so you can browse the archived copy at simonw.github.io/cia-world-factbook-2020/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a neat example of the editorial voice of the Factbook from the What's New page, dated December 10th 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Years of wrangling were brought to a close this week when officials from Nepal and China announced that they have agreed on the height of Mount Everest. The mountain sits on the border between Nepal and Tibet (in western China), and its height changed slightly following an earthquake in 2015. The new height of 8,848.86 meters is just under a meter higher than the old figure of 8,848 meters. The World Factbook rounds the new measurement to 8,849 meters and this new height has been entered throughout the Factbook database.&lt;/p&gt;
