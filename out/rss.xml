  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some time around the year 466 BCE – in the second year of the 78th Olympiad, the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder tells us – a massive meteor blazed across the sky in broad daylight, crashing to the earth with an enormous explosion near the small Greek town of Aegospotami, or ‘Goat Rivers’, on the European side of the Hellespont in northeastern Greece. Pliny’s younger contemporary, the Greek biographer Plutarch, wrote that the locals still worshipped the scorched brownish metallic boulder, the size of a wagon-load, that was left after the explosion; it remained on display in Pliny and Plutarch’s time, five centuries later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both writers connect the meteorite with the Greek scientist Anaxagoras, who had a widely-known theory that heavenly bodies are made of the same sort of matter found on earth. The amazed Greeks took the stone as spectacular confirmation of this crazy idea, and Anaxagoras’s name would be linked to it forever afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get a better idea of this meteorite’s figurative impact, consider a parallel from closer to our own time. Albert Einstein published his general theory of relativity in 1915, a decade after the narrower special theory of relativity had established a secure scientific reputation for him, along with other important papers he published in 1905, his annus mirabilis. Few physicists could follow the ins and outs of general relativity, and its immediate influence was slight. But one of those few was Arthur Eddington, whose widely publicised 1919 observations of a solar eclipse appeared to confirm Einstein’s revolutionary prediction that gravity bends light. ‘LIGHTS ALL ASKEW IN THE HEAVENS’ ran the delightful headline in The New York Times. ‘Men of Science More or Less Agog Over Results of Eclipse Observations. EINSTEIN THEORY TRIUMPHS.’ Overnight, Einstein’s name became synonymous with genius; two years later he won a Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we took that level of agog and multiplied it hundredfold, we might begin to approach the shockwave of the Aegospotami meteorite – and its effect on Anaxagoras’s reputation. For one thing, revolutionary as it was, Einstein’s improvement on Newton was subtle, not only in being hard to grasp but also in the sense that the effects Einstein predicted will never be perceptible to normal people under normal circumstances. Anaxagoras’s ‘general theory’ of the heavens completely shattered normal circumstances. The sky would never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a modern person, grasping Anaxagoras’s audacity takes some doing, but it will help to recall that the chief organ of sight is not the eye but the brain. In other words, it’s our brains, not our eyes, that tell us what we’re looking at. When people in the ancient world looked up at the night sky, like us they saw lights. But that’s where the shared experience stops. Our brains tell us most of those lights are distant suns, and a handful of others are floating spheres in orbit around our sun, like the earth. Their brains told them all those lights were gods or mythical creatures. The idea that they might be objects floating in space didn’t exist yet. We look at the sun and see a giant ball of hydrogen converting itself into helium through a process of nuclear fusion; an ancient Greek saw the god Helios, driving a blazing chariot. We look at the moon and see a cold, airless, dusty ball of rock partly lit by the sun; an ancient Greek saw the goddess Selene, aglow with her own soft luminosity. The cosmos was alive, brimming with gods and goddesses, and their movements were omens. A basically well-ordered place – the Greek word cosmos originally meant “order” – its stability was nonetheless always under threat by the unruly. It quivered with agency and import, and it was all connected in an organic whole, from great to small alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first to split this seamless cosmos was Thales, who lived perhaps just over a century before Anaxagoras, in the region of coastal Anatolia (modern Turkey) known to the Greeks as Ionia. Ionia’s principal city was the fabulous trading port of Miletus, where Thales was from, so he is known to history as Thales of Miletus. If the Greek world were a quiet pond and we threw a stone representing ‘the tradition of free rational inquiry’ into it, Miletus would be the site of the splash. From there, the waves spread outward within a few generations. Thales had students, his students had students, those students had their own students, and so on. Thales and his successors recognised that there’s a real world out there, that it’s governed by orderly operations of its own, and that we don’t need gods or spirits to explain how those operations work. They cracked the world in two parts, natural and supernatural, and in doing so they pushed the supernatural off to one side. Together, they are the first scientists. And, yes, they made waves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The achievements of these early scientists have long been dismissed by scholars, largely because, with the benefit of hindsight, they seem so basic. And it’s true that compared with the rapid progress Greek science made starting a bit later, in Plato and Aristotle’s time, those contributions might well appear trifling. Not to mention compared with today. Yet science had to start somewhere. A more accurate assessment might judge them not against what came after, but against what came before. From this perspective, these earliest insights were astonishing and unparalleled, as Daniel Graham, a classicist and historian of science at Brigham Young University, has now demonstrated in his authoritative 2013 book Science Before Socrates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graham paints a new picture of early science that gives central roles to Anaxagoras and his perhaps slightly older contemporary, Parmenides. Both could trace their intellectual ancestry back to Thales through teacher-student relationships. While invoking natural causes for things, Thales had stuck to the conventional view that the earth is a flat plate supported by something. As far as we know, the intuitive idea of a flat earth was common to all cultures the world over, though the supporting arrangement runs the gamut from turtles for the Maya to pillars for the Hebrews to elephants for the Indians. Thales’s student Anaximander was the first to propose the earth as an object floating in space. According to him, it was shaped something like a bongo drum, with a flat surface at either end. The sky was generally seen as a dome or vault above the flat earth, across which the sun, moon, planets and stars moved or were pulled in regular patterns. One of Anaximander’s students, Xenophanes, envisaged a sort of grid universe in which the earth is an infinite plane with numerous suns and moons crossing it in straight lines. Another thinker, Heraclitus (of not-being-able-to-step-in-the-same-river-twice fame), claimed the moon is a bowl of fire. He, too, thought we get a new sun every day – the size of a human foot. It’s understandable that modern scholars might dismiss such notions as wildly speculative and ungrounded in empirical observation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not so fast, says Daniel Graham. Even Heraclitus had worked out his fiery bowl theory of the moon so that it agreed with the observable lunar phases. What makes his theory feel out of touch to us is not so much the bowl part (after all, why not?) as the part where the moon is giving off its own light. That was the universal belief at the time, however, and not senseless at all, but common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where Parmenides comes in, a student of Xenophanes from the Greek colony of Elea in southern Italy. Long understood only as a feverish theoriser caught up with abstruse questions of being and nothingness (which, admittedly, he was), Parmenides is also revealed by Graham’s careful research to have been a hard-headed empirical astronomer. For it was he who figured out that the moon gets its light from the sun, an insight now so pervasive as to be entirely taken for granted by little children. Yet there it is for the first time in the few surviving scraps of Parmenides’s poem On Nature, in which he strikingly describes the moon as ‘a lamp by night, wandering around the earth with borrowed light’ and ‘ever gazing toward the rays of the sun’. That second part suggests how Parmenides worked: by methodically observing lunar phases, and noticing what Heraclitus had not – that the bright part of the moon always faces the sun. Before Parmenides, other theorists, like Heraclitus, all portray the moon as generating its own light; after him, they all understand that moonlight is actually reflected sunlight. Heliophotism, this idea has been dubbed recently, in the way scientists still like to use Greek. Or, in English, ‘sunlightism’. It is arguably the first genuine scientific discovery, and quite possibly the most productive. Much else would be illuminated by it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right away, Parmenides’s explanation shone a bright light on the sphere, sphaira in Greek. Heliophotism entails that the moon is a sphere – it doesn’t make sense any other way. And if the moon is a sphere, why not the earth? Parmenides’s other great contribution follows naturally: he was the first thinker to suggest the sphericity of the earth, building on the earlier conception of the earth as an object floating in space. Soon to follow: orbits, and, eventually, rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All well and good, but straightway heliophotism also put a spotlight on the mother of all omens: eclipses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cut to Athens in the year 478 BCE, on the morning of February 17th. The Aegospotami meteorite’s landfall is twelve years in the future. It’s an extraordinary time for the Athenians, cresting a wave after the decisive defeat of invading Persian forces over the previous couple of years. The city has been reduced to rubble – but no matter. The Athenians had deliberately abandoned it to fight at sea, under the leadership of the brilliant Themistocles. The strategy paid off at nearby Salamis, where Greek ships under Athenian command routed the numerically superior Persian navy under the stunned gaze of Xerxes himself, the Persian king. Now the Persians are on the run, chased back across the Aegean Sea. Not far from Aegospotami, Sestus, the main Persian base on the Hellespont, is about to fall to Athenian-led forces after a long siege that began the previous summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few minutes before noon, however, Athens literally turns gloomy. The sky darkens, and the sun dims to a dusky disc encircled by a ring of fire. Disaster looming, despite the recent run of luck? Nemesis rearing its ugly head over the hubristic Athenians? Perhaps not. Or at least not yet. Eclipses had always – always – been taken as portents of catastrophe, but Daniel Graham argues that this one is different. This solar eclipse, he suggests, is the first one in history to be understood at the time it was happening – for one Ionian theorist, at least, the first disenchanted eclipse, with no evil spirit, no malicious demon eating the sun god, just the shadow of a sphere moving across the earth. Before Anaxagoras, philosophers floated lots of different ideas about eclipses, ideas that may seem ridiculous now, but notice that none of them involve the gods. A ring around the sun closes and opens. Clouds block the sunlight. The sun runs out of fuel temporarily. Heraclitus, we are not terribly surprised to hear, said the sun is a fiery bowl and its light is blocked now and then by the rim. Like Anaxagoras, Thales, too, was credited by some later writers with figuring out eclipses, but, again, Graham emphasises the timing. After Anaxagoras, everyone seems to understand that in a solar eclipse the moon casts a shadow on the earth, and that in a lunar eclipse the earth casts a shadow on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eclipses, then, another point of contact with Einstein and relativity, were Anaxagoras’s ‘special theory’, establishing a secure but modest reputation for him with other thinkers. He could easily have learned from sailors’ eyewitness reports what modern computer models show: the path of this solar eclipse had passed directly over the Peloponnesus, the large roughly circular landmass that makes up the southern Greek mainland, and of which Sparta was the chief city. The eclipse’s umbra was about the same size, putting nearly the entire Peloponnesus neatly in the shade. Later reports said Anaxagoras claimed the moon was about the size of the Peloponnesus, and the sun somewhat larger, which is of course partly true, technically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sort of investigation was in keeping with the Ionian tradition in which Anaxagoras had been trained. It was called historia, which, owing to its popularisation a scant generation later by Herodotus, has come down to us as ‘history’. But its basic meaning is inquiry, and it still applied to the natural world. Only later, after Herodotus, would it take on the meaning of inquiry into the human past. At this time, Herodotus was a boy, growing up just south of Ionia. He knew it well and may have lived there for a time. When he came to write his groundbreaking history of the wars with Persia, he too would interview witnesses, asking questions and most likely buying drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Science and history both got their start in this Ionian tradition, but Ionia had been a war zone for decades by 460 BCE, around the time Anaxagoras probably came to Athens, where he is said to have stayed thirty years, as the Athenians told stories about him as an old man. Many have the feel of tales told to burnish an image of eccentric and cosmopolitan genius. When asked if he was interested in his home country, Anaxagoras gestured to the sky and replied that, yes, he was very interested in his home country. Plutarch says Anaxagoras let his house fall to ruin ‘while he pursued his lofty thoughts and his passion for speculation’, which couldn’t have pleased his poor neighbours much. One of his lofty thoughts was that the universe is governed by a principle he called ‘Mind’, so the salty Athenians’ nickname for him, naturally, was ‘Mind’. Not so lofty, perhaps, was his insistence, against Parmenides, that the earth was flat – in another parallel with Einstein, also a refugee scientist who balked at some of the implications of his own discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His ‘prediction’ of the Aegospotami meteorite had secured Anaxagoras’s reputation as a full-on genius. He must have spent the years between the eclipse and the meteorite pondering the implications of heliophotism, and of his own theory of eclipses, which rested on it. Among his conclusions, as Graham sees it, are that the moon is a solid body, like the earth. It blocks sunlight completely, rather than letting some of it shine through, the way clouds do. And if the moon is a solid body, there could be other solid bodies up there too. Again, this seems basic to us, but remember – no one at the time had the foggiest notion what was up there. Or rather, a foggy notion was exactly what they had. A common theory about the moon held that it was cloud-like in its makeup, so Anaxagoras really was going out on a limb (so to speak). In fact, the prevailing view among his predecessors was that celestial and atmospheric phenomena were all of a piece. Clouds, stars, sun, moon – pretty much the same light, airy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why the Aegospotami meteorite hit so hard, and why it was taken as Anaxagoras’s prediction. He didn’t predict the time or place, but he did predict the possibility. That prognostication went not only against common sense, but against the best science as well. There are rocks in the sky! Lights all askew in the heavens! Chicken Little, look to your laurels. If there had been a New York Times, it would have read ANAXAGORAS THEORY TRIUMPHS. A voice in the wilderness was suddenly and dramatically vindicated. Men of science were completely agog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And possibly women too. One of Anaxagoras’s fellow Ionians in Athens was Aspasia, a brilliant and highly cultivated refugee from Miletus. Prominent in Athenian society, she’s also one of the few women we know anything about in ancient Greece, which was highly patriarchal. But Plutarch says she taught rhetoric in her home, and that Socrates was among her students. Pericles, the Athenian democratic leader who lent his name to the age, famously divorced his wife to pursue a relationship with Aspasia. As Pericles himself was also very close to Anaxagoras, it would have been easy for the highly curious Aspasia to keep herself up on the latest scientific developments. In fact, some sources paired her with Anaxagoras as well, though that might just be historians’ gossip. Later writers portray her as a courtesan, but that too may reflect male discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for Pericles, Plutarch says that Anaxagoras, about five years the politician’s senior, was the ‘one man more closely associated with Pericles than any other’. Expounding on the favourable influence of Anaxagoras and science generally, he writes that Pericles ‘learned from his teaching to rise above the superstitious terror which springs from an ignorant wonder at the common phenomena of the heavens. It affects those who know nothing of the causes of such things, who fear the gods to the point of madness and are easily confused through their lack of experience. A knowledge of natural causes, on the other hand, banishes those fears and replaces morbid superstition with a piety which rests on a secure foundation supported by rational hopes.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or not, as the case may be. Plutarch’s rationalistic idea of piety resembled that of those eminent Victorians who embraced science and the established church with equal nonchalance. But if Plutarch had lived in Victorian times, he would certainly have known Newton’s third law of motion: ‘For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.”’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backlash came sooner rather than later, though it certainly came late too. Scientific explanation wasn’t the only Greek novelty. Plutarch himself tells the story, which the Irish classicist ER Dodds revisited in his iconoclastic 1951 book The Greeks and the Irrational. At the height of classical Athens, an era future generations would hold up as a shining triumph of reason and enlightenment, ‘most of the leaders of progressive thought’ were prosecuted for offences against religion, Dodds wrote. Evoking Newton, perhaps, he described this campaign in a chapter titled ‘Rationalism and Reaction in the Classical Age’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it started with the trial and banishment of Anaxagoras. The charges against Anaxagoras, Plutarch says, were brought by a diviner named Diopeithes, one of those whose livelihoods were based on the interpretation of eclipses and other omens; his decree proposed ‘that anybody who did not believe in the gods or taught theories about celestial phenomena should be liable to prosecution’. This is history’s first anti-intellectualism, and the first science-bashing by the pious, though hardly the last of either. It’s also the first recorded attempt at state-sponsored thought control, a good eight centuries before the Christian church staked out that territory with the backing of Roman imperial power, and indeed (as far as I can tell) the first explicit mention of religious belief at all, as opposed to practice. Plutarch’s account suggests Anaxagoras delayed publishing his only book, perhaps for several decades, out of concern for precisely such a backlash – in much the way Charles Darwin would during the Victorian era, another age of scientific progress and religious reaction (respectable nonchalance notwithstanding). ‘Pericles,’ Plutarch says, ‘was so alarmed for Anaxagoras’s safety that he smuggled him out of the city.’ Banished from Athens, the old philosopher settled in Lampsacus, across the Hellespont from Aegospotami, where he lived out his days a stone’s throw from the meteorite that had brought him fame. The people there, we’re told, held him in great esteem; after his death he was given a solemn funeral and a fine memorial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Athens they’d had enough astronomy for the moment. ‘Public opinion was instinctively hostile to natural philosophers …’ Plutarch writes in explaining the spree that began with Anaxagoras’s trial, ‘since it was generally believed they belittled the power of the gods…’ It was this instinctive suspicion of ‘natural causes’ – ho physikos logos in Plutarch’s Greek – that the opportunistic, disgruntled diviner Diopeithes took advantage of to attack Anaxagoras, Athens’s poster-boy for scientific genius.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why would the Athenians in particular turn against science in this way? Starting in 431 BCE, the city became embroiled in a war against Sparta that Pericles, an Athenian expansionist, had pushed for. Pericles died in the war’s second year, a victim of the great plague that killed perhaps one in three Athenians as they were penned into the city by Spartan forces. Known as the Peloponnesian War, this long, destructive conflict lasted nearly thirty years. As Dodds suggested, and as the Romanian classicist Alexander Rubel demonstrates in his book Fear and Loathing in Ancient Athens (first published in German in 2000 but translated into English only in 2014), the war exacerbated the suspicions many Athenians already harboured against philosophers and scientists, giving traction to religious fears, misgivings, and resentments that might have lain dormant in less anxious times. Rubel and Richard Janko, a British classicist currently at the University of Michigan, have proposed the year 430 BCE, not too long after the outbreak of war and plague – and right after another eclipse that was followed by a disastrous military expedition under Pericles’ command – for Anaxagoras’s exile. (Anaxagoras’s dates are notoriously difficult, and the sources are contradictory. Richard Janko, who accepts Graham’s main points about the scientific picture, offers a different timeline for Anaxagoras’s movements, which I have followed in this essay.) Prosecutions for impiety continued. One Diagoras of Melos, popularly known as ‘the Atheist’, was convicted of impiety and exiled around the middle of the war. So was another associate of Pericles, the sophist Protagoras, a suspected espouser of moral relativity and secular inquiry, which – then as now – carried a whiff of subversion to the nostrils of true believers. The progressive playwright Euripides, whose razor-sharp dramas incorporated the latest ideas in philosophy and science (making him the Tom Stoppard of classical Athens), is said to have been acquitted of similar charges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Influential Oxford scholars like Hugh Lloyd-Jones and Kenneth Dover – Dodds’s own student – rejected Dodds’s interpretation, questioning the historicity of these incidents, including Plutarch’s account of the Diopeithes decree, which is the only place it’s mentioned. Yet Dodds has enjoyed a bit of a comeback lately. A conference at Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 2014 produced Rediscovering E. R. Dodds: Scholarship, Education, Poetry, and the Paranormal (2019), a somewhat backhanded appreciation that leaves an impression of Dodds as a formidable scholar and subtle thinker who unfortunately happened to be wrong about everything. More recently, Daisy Dunn’s Not Far from Brideshead: Oxford Between the Wars (2022) offers an engaging and perceptive account of Dodds’s socially fraught career at Oxford, from his arrival in 1912 as an Irish boy with ‘dilapidated shoes’ to his controversial appointment as Regius Professor of Greek and eventual recognition as ‘one of the most vibrant intellectuals of the twentieth century’. And other classicists have defended Dodds more forcefully than the Corpus group, including Alexander Rubel and Richard Janko: the latter, writing in The Journal of Hellenic Studies in 2020, grounds ‘the Athenians’ war on science’ in the sources and sees ‘a failure of imagination’ in Dodds’s critics. As both Rubel and Janko observe, it’s true Plutarch can be unreliable, but it’s also true he had sources we do not. It feels tendentious to disqualify him, along with many other sources, so seemingly arbitrarily. Dodds might yet have the last word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because, finally, there was Socrates. In 399 BCE, at age seventy, the Athenian philosopher was tried, convicted, and executed for ‘impiety and corrupting the youth of Athens’ with his teaching. It was just five years after the Spartan victory, during the war’s violent and oppressive aftermath (and six years after its last major battle, the crushing defeat of the Athenian navy at none other than Aegospotami). The story of Socrates’s trial and death is familiar enough in its outlines. Hidden deep beneath this popular understanding, however, lies the curious possibility that in condemning Socrates, the Athenians were, in effect, really avenging themselves on Anaxagoras, decades after his escape to Lampsacus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Socrates himself thought so, at least as Plato portrays him in the Apology. Accused – falsely, he maintains – of not believing in the gods, he says to the contrary that ‘just like the rest of humanity’ he believes the sun and moon are indeed gods. If his students ever heard otherwise, it was only because he was relating the theories of Anaxagoras, whose book was readily available (if overpriced) in the market. And everyone knows that they were Anaxagoras’s theories. It would have been ridiculous to attempt to pass them off as his own opinions, he argues, so don’t tar him with that brush. ‘Do you think you are accusing Anaxagoras?’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Plato has Socrates say that he did study Anaxagoras’s theories and those of the other scientists as a young man. At first, Socrates tells us in the Phaedo, he ‘was tremendously eager for the kind of wisdom which they call investigation [historia] of nature.’ He was especially interested in knowing the true causes of things, but found esoteric discussions of being and nothingness and change quite confusing. ‘Then one day I heard a man reading from a book, as he said, by Anaxagoras, that it is Mind that arranges and causes all things.’ This felt right to him, as it answered his deep desire for a power that ‘arranges everything and establishes each thing as it is best for it to be’. So he read every scroll of Anaxagoras’s book, determined to learn ‘about the sun and the moon and the other stars, their relative speed, their revolutions, and their other changes, and why the passive or active condition of each of them is for the best’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That ‘glorious hope’ was quickly dashed, however. In Anaxagoras’s account, it seemed to Socrates, Mind had no agency other than initially setting things in motion, and no morality. Things weren’t arranged for the best, they were merely arranged. In what strikes me as the first articulation of the concept we know as supernatural power, Socrates says he’s looking for a supreme being with ‘divine force’ (daimonia ischys in Plato’s Greek), but Anaxagoras’s Mind was a dud. For this reason, Socrates tells us plainly, he completely lost interest in the heavens, in science, and in physical reality (ta onta, ‘the things that are’).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plato’s Socrates, then, was clearly disenchanted with disenchantment, though it goes against his modern image as an enlightened secular thinker. Instead, as I have worked on a book about the historical and psychological origins of religious faith, I’ve reluctantly come to see Socrates as a herald of woo. The very same distaste for natural causes expressed by Socrates and observed by Plutarch ultimately gave rise to a tsunami of triumphalist supernaturalism, which ER Dodds chronicled in fascinating detail in a later book, Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety (1965). We might call the seismic impulse behind it science shock. After all, you can’t have a concept of ‘supernatural’ unless you already have a concept of ‘natural’ – but once you do, it follows right away. The stronger the bonds of nature are perceived to be, the stronger must be the ‘divine force’ that bends or breaks them; the more concrete the boundary, the bigger the thrill of transgression. As science grew more established in Hellenistic and then Graeco-Roman culture, slowly neutering the old gods of nature, this psychological effect set the stage for the new prominence of miracles in the crisis-ridden centuries of the early Christian era. In the same way, it also ratcheted up the power of the new Christian god, who stood above nature, and whose totalising authority made not just Zeus but even YHWH look rather anaemic by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;St Paul offered a panacea for the trauma of disenchantment, a lifeboat that bobbed easily on the rising tide of supernaturalism. Writing in the time of Pliny and Plutarch, Paul extolled pistis, ‘faith’, defining it in a way Socrates surely would have recognised: ‘the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen’. He even used the quintessentially Socratic word elenchus, here translated as ‘conviction’, which is not the only verbal echo of Plato in this short formulation. His truly ingenious move was to exalt not just one supernatural figure, like other mystery cults, but the very concept of supernatural power itself – and to promise believers a share in that power for themselves. If Jesus was McDonald, a fellow with a great burger shack, Paul was Ray Kroc, establishing the franchise in the name of the founder and issuing standardising directives to Romans, Corinthians, Ephesians, Thessalonians. He erected a warm and personal supernatural system to stand against the cold, impersonal natural system of science. His constituency was not just any old gentiles, but precisely those gentiles first crushed under the heavy hand of natural laws: the Greeks. And so (as I’ve argued in more detail elsewhere) the first global franchise was set up on an anti-science basis. We associate the ‘war on science’ with modern faith, or with historical figures such as Galileo or Giordano Bruno. But faith itself grew out of the war on science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Science shock and triumphalist supernaturalism are as old as science itself – but no older – and they’re still with us today, concealed beneath layers of love and fellowship and suicide vests and assassinated abortion doctors. Gorgeous or gross, such items are little more than tribal window dressing. Faith can do without them and they without it. But faith can’t do without affirming the triumph of the supernatural. This common denominator is what Diopeithes (and even Socrates) share with the preachers flogging Covid-19 snake oil in the form of ‘supernatural healings’ a few years ago to their megachurch flocks, who were enjoined to touch their TV screens and be healed through the mighty power of Jesus. Humans, it seems, have an instinctive affinity for supernatural thinking that science offends. Wherever science has been, there also has been science shock, which has expressed itself not only in religious faith, but also in a long list of pseudosciences and occult fads from astrology to theosophy to today’s New Age Goopies and anti-vaxxers. It can lie dormant in good times, when it might evoke little more than a plaintive protest resembling that of the immortal Peggy Lee, who (so enchantingly) asked, ‘Is that all there is?’ At other times – well, let’s just say it can flare up with a vengeance when things go south, if that rings a bell for those following recent events in, say, Washington, DC’s Department of Health and Human Services. Or anywhere else on this floating sphere of rock and water, for that matter, currently burning, boiling, plastic-strangle and addled by chaotic electronic impulses into something resembling a sort of global epilepsy. Age of Anxiet anyone? Paging Mr ER Dodds …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Socrates rejected Anaxagoras and his ideas so strongly, we might well wonder, how did he end up in the dock for him? Somehow, despite the differences between them, Socrates had inherited from Anaxagoras the role of Athens’s resident intellectual. Partly, no doubt, it was because Socrates himself played up to it, with his relentless questions and disputations and definitions and symposiums. Perhaps this was why the comic playwright Aristophanes, in his hilarious send-up of rational inquiry, The Clouds, had chosen to name his mad-scientist villain, who was clearly inspired by Anaxagoras, ‘Socrates’. From his school, the Think Tank, ‘Socrates’ puts ‘the clouds’ in place of the gods, complete with a secular explanation taken straight from Anaxagoras, that clouds are bags of air, and thunder and lightning – Zeus’s special ordnance, no less! – are simply what happen when they bump into each other. Plato’s Socrates mentions this play, written years earlier in the middle of the war, as something that helped turn the public against him. At the end, the Think Tank is burned down, and ‘Socrates’ is beaten and chased off the stage to cries of ‘Revenge! Revenge for the injured gods!’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Dodds observed, the revenge taken against the real Socrates was misplaced. When a truer revenge came, ironically, it would take the form of something very much like the higher power that Plato’s Socrates vainly sought in the godless scrolls of Anaxagoras. Today, Anaxagoras’s successors detect echoes of the Big Bang in the background heat of his cosmos. In much the same way, we’re also still living with the reverberations of that long-ago impact at Aegospotami.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2001, quantum computers factored the number 15. It’s now 2025, and quantum computers haven’t yet factored the number 21. It’s sometimes claimed this is proof there’s been no progress in quantum computers. But there’s actually a much more surprising reason 21 hasn’t been factored yet, which jumps out at you when contrasting the operations used to factor 15 and to factor 21.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The circuit (the series of quantum logic gates) that was run to factor 15 can be seen in Figure 1b of “Experimental realization of Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm using nuclear magnetic resonance”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important cost here is the number of entangling gates. This factoring-15 circuit has 6 two-qubit entangling gates (a mix of CNOT and CPHASE gates). It also has 2 Toffoli gates, which each decompose into 6 two-qubit entangling gates. So there’s a total of 21 entangling gates in this circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, for comparison, here is a circuit for factoring 21. Sorry for rotating it, but I couldn’t get it to fit otherwise. Try counting the Toffolis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Here’s an OPENQASM2 version of the circuit, so you can test it produces the right distribution if you’re inclined to do so.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case you lost count: this circuit has 191 cnot gates and 369 Toffoli gates, implying a total of 2405 entangling gates. That’s 115x more entangling gates than the factoring-15 circuit. The factoring-21 circuit is more than one hundred times more expensive than the factoring-15 circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I ask people to guess how many times larger the factoring-21 circuit is, compared to the factoring-15 circuit, there’s a tendency for them to assume it’s 25% larger. Or maybe twice as large. The fact that it’s two orders of magnitude more expensive is shocking. So I’ll try to explain why it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Quick aside: the amount of optimization that has gone into this factoring-21 circuit is probably unrepresentative of what would be possible when factoring big numbers. I think a more plausible amount of optimization would produce a circuit with 500x the cost of the factoring-15 circuit… but a 100x overhead is sufficient to make my point. Regardless, special thanks to Noah Shutty for running expensive computer searches to find the conditional-multiplication-by-4-mod-21 subroutine used by this circuit.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where does the 100x come from?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key background fact you need to understand is that the dominant cost of a quantum factoring circuit comes from doing a series of conditional modular multiplications under superposition. To factor an $n$-bit number $N$, Shor’s algorithm will conditionally multiply an accumulator by $m_k = g^{2^k} \pmod{N}$ for each $k &amp;lt; 2n$ (where $g$ is a randomly chosen value coprime to $N$). Sometimes people also worry about the frequency basis measurement at the end of the algorithm, which is crucial to the algorithm’s function, but from a cost perspective it’s irrelevant. (It’s negligible due by an optimization called “qubit recycling”, which I also could have used to reduce the qubit count of the factoring-21 circuit, but in this post I’m just counting gates so meh).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three effects that conspire to make the factoring-15 multiplications substantially cheaper than the factoring-21 multiplications:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All but two of the factoring-15 multiplications end up multiplying by 1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The first multiplication is always ~free, because its input is known to be 1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The one remaining factoring-15 multiplication can be implemented with only two CSWAPs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider the case where $g=2$. In that case, when factoring 15, the constants to conditionally multiply by would be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print([pow(2, 2**k, 15) for k in range(8)])
[2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, notice that the last six constants are 1. Multiplications by 1 can be implemented by doing nothing. So the factoring-15 circuit is only paying for 2 of the expected 8 multiplications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, notice that the first conditional multiplication (by 2) will either leave the accumulator storing 1 (when its control is off) or storing 2 (when its control is on). This can be achieved much more cheaply by performing a controlled xor of $1 \oplus 2 = 3$ into the accumulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, notice that the only remaining multiplication is a multiplication by 4. Because 15 is one less than a power of 2, multiplying by 2 modulo 15 can be implemented using a circular shift. A multiplication by 4 is just two multiplications by 2, so it can also be implemented by a circular shift. This is a very rare property for a modular multiplication to have, and here it reduces what should be an expensive operation into a pair of conditional swaps. (If you go back and look at the factoring-15 circuit at the top of the post, the 2 three-qubit gates are being used to implement these two conditional swaps.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may worry that these savings are specific to the choice of $g=2$ and $N=15$. And they are in fact specific to $N=15$. But they aren’t specific to $g=2$. They occur for all possible choices of $g$ when factoring 15.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For contrast, let’s now consider what happens when factoring 21. Using $g=2$, the multiplication constants would be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  print([pow(2, 2**k, 21) for k in range(10)])
[2, 4, 16, 4, 16, 4, 16, 4, 16, 4]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is going to be a lot more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, there’s no multiplications by 1, so the circuit has to pay for every multiplication instead of only a quarter. That’s a ~4x relative cost blowup vs factoring 15. Second, although the first-one’s-free trick does still apply, proportionally speaking it’s not as good. It cheapens 10% of the multiplications rather than 50%. That’s an extra ~1.8x cost blowup vs factoring 15. Third, the multiplication by 4 and 16 can’t be implemented with two CSWAPs. The best conditionally-multiply-by-4-mod-21 circuit that I know is the one being used in the diagram above, and it uses 41 Toffolis. These more expensive multiplications add a final bonus ~20x cost blowup vs factoring 15.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Aside: multiplication by 16 mod 21 is the inverse of multiplying by 4 mod 21, and the circuits are reversible, so multiplying by 16 uses the same number of Toffolis as multiplying by 4.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These three factors (multiplying-by-one, first-one’s-free, and multiplying-by-swapping) explain the 100x blowup in cost of factoring 21, compared to factoring 15. And this 100x increase in cost explains why no one has factored 21 with a quantum computer yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another contributor to the huge time gap between factoring 15 and factoring 21 is that the 2001 factoring of 15 was done with an NMR quantum computer. These computers were known to have inherent scaling issues, and in fact it’s debated whether NMR computers were even properly “quantum”. If the 2001 NMR experiment doesn’t count, I think the actually-did-the-multiplications runner-up is a 2015 experiment done with an ion trap quantum computer (discussed by Scott Aaronson at the time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet another contributor is the overhead of quantum error correction. Performing 100x more gates requires 100x lower error, and the most plausible way of achieving that is error corection. Error correction requires redundancy, and could easily add a 100x overhead on qubit count. Accounting for this, I could argue that factoring 21 will be ten thousand times more expensive than factoring 15, rather than “merely” a hundred times more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are papers that claim to have factored 21 with a quantum computer. For example, here’s one from 2021. But, as far as I know, all such experiments are guilty of using optimizations that imply the code generating the circuit had access to information equivalent to knowing the factors (as explained in “Pretending to factor large numbers on a quantum computer” by Smolin et al). Basically: they don’t do the multiplications, because the multiplications are hard, but the multiplications are what make it factoring instead of simpler forms of period finding. So I don’t count them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is unfortunately a trickle of bullshit results that claim to be quantum factoring demonstrations. For example, I have a joke paper in this year’s sigbovik proceedings that cheats in a particularly silly way. More seriously, I enjoyed “Replication of Quantum Factorisation Records with an 8-bit Home Computer, an Abacus, and a Dog” making fun of some recent egregious papers. I also recommend Scott Aaronson’s post “Quantum computing motte-and-baileys”, which complains about papers that benchmark “variational” factoring techniques while ignoring the lack of any reason to expect them to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the large cost of quantum factoring numbers (that aren’t 15), factoring isn’t yet a good benchmark for tracking the progress of quantum computers. If you want to stay abreast of progress in quantum computing, you should be paying attention to the arrival quantum error correction (such as surface codes getting more reliable as their size is increased) and to architectures solving core scaling challenges (such as lost neutral atoms being continuously replaced).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It appears that it was US military communications doctrine to not send the exact same message twice using different encryption ("none" counting as one type of encryption), and the term of art for changing a message to avoid that was indeed "paraphrase".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I managed to dig up a US Army document on Cryptology from roughly that era that appears to discuss paraphrasing. The document in question is Department of the Army Technical Manual TM 32-220(pdf), dated 1950, titled "BASIC CRYPTOGRAPHY". It apparently supersedes previous documents TM-484 from March 1945 and TM 11-485 from June 1944. It would probably be more ideal to look at them, since they are closer to the time you are interested in, but I was not able to find them online.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's what this declassified manual had to say about "paraphrasing", from Chapter 7, in the section Fundamental Rules of Cryptographic Security, section 84, subsection b, rule 3 (titled "Text of messages")&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;(a) Never repeat in the clear the identical text of a message once sent in cryptographic form, or repeat in cryptographic form the text of a message once sent in the clear. Anything which will enable an alert enemy to compare a given piece of plain text with a cryptogram that supposedly contains this plain text is highly dangerous to the safety of the cryptographic system. Where information must be given out for publicity, or where information is handled by many persons, the plain text version should be very carefully paraphrased before distribution, to minimize the data an enemy might obtain from an accurate comparison of the cryptographic text with the equivalent, original plain text. To paraphrase a message means to rewrite it so as to change its original wording as much as possible without changing the meaning of the message. This is done by altering the positions of sentences in the message, by altering the positions of subject, predicate, and modifying phrases or clauses in the sentence, and by altering as much as possible the diction by the use of synonyms and synonymous expressions. In this process, deletion rather than expansion of the wording of the message is preferable, because if an ordinary message is paraphrased simply by expanding it along its original lines, an expert can easily reduce the paraphrased message to its lowest terms, and the resultant wording will be practically the original message. It is very important to eliminate repeated words or proper names, if at all possible, by the use of carefully selected pronouns; by the use of the words "former," "latter," "first-mentioned," "second-mentioned"; or by other means. After carefully paraphrasing, the message can be sent in the other key or code.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;(b) Never send the literal plain text or a paraphrased version of the plain text of a message which has been or will be transmitted in cryptographed form except as specifically provided in appropriate regulations&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In fact the allies would have have known intimately about how this was possible, because this is one of the ways they ended up decrypting the stronger German Enigma cipher. Captured machines using simpler ciphers were used to break those simpler ciphers. The fact that the Germans were encrypting the exact same messages in both ciphers meant the allies could know (for those messages) what both the unencrypted and encrypted messages were, which allowed them to decrypt the stronger cyphers as well, or quickly figure out what today's code was.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though Enigma had some cryptographic weaknesses, in practice it was German procedural flaws, operator mistakes, failure to systematically introduce changes in encipherment procedures, and Allied capture of key tables and hardware that, during the war, enabled Allied cryptologists to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Vibe Shift? Senior Developers Ship nearly 2.5x more AI Code than Junior Counterparts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content Marketing Manager&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fastlyâs July 2025 survey of 791 developers found a notable difference in how much AI-generated code is making it into production. About a third of senior developers (10+ years of experience) say over half their shipped code is AI-generated â nearly two and a half times the rate reported by junior developers (0â2 years of experience), at 13%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âAI will bench test code and find errors much faster than a human, repairing them seamlessly. This has been the case many times,â one senior developer said. A junior respondent noted the trade-offs: âItâs always hard when AI assumes what Iâm doing and thatâs not the case, so I have to go back and redo it myself.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers were also more likely to say they invest time fixing AI-generated code. Just under 30% of seniors reported editing AI output enough to offset most of the time savings, compared to 17% of juniors. Even so, 59% of seniors say AI tools help them ship faster overall, compared to 49% of juniors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Senior Developers Are More Optimistic About AI Saving Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just over 50% of junior developers say AI makes them moderately faster. By contrast, only 39% of more senior developers say the same. But senior devs are more likely to report significant speed gains: 26% say AI makes them a lot faster, double the 13% of junior devs who agree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason for this gap may be that senior developers are simply better equipped to catch and correct AIâs mistakes. They have the experience to recognize when code âlooks rightâ but isnât. That makes them more confident at using AI tools efficiently, even for high-stakes or business-critical code. By contrast, junior developers may not fully trust their ability to spot errors, which can make them more cautious about relying on AI, or more likely to avoid using it in production at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That tracks with how much AI-generated code actually makes it into production. Among junior devs, just 13% say over half of their shipped code is AI-generated. By contrast, 32% of senior developers say the same, suggesting that more experienced engineers are not only using AI more aggressively, but are also trusting it more in production environments. This is surprising given growing concerns about âvibe codingâ introducing vulnerabilities into applications.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Perception vs. Reality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly 1 in 3 developers (28%) say they frequently have to fix or edit AI-generated code enough that it offsets most of the time savings. Only 14% say they rarely need to make changes. And yet, over half of developers still feel faster with AI tools like Copilot, Gemini, or Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fastlyâs survey isnât alone in calling AI productivity gains into question. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of experienced open-source developers found something even more striking: when developers used AI tools, they took 19% longer to complete their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This disconnect may come down to psychology. AI coding often feels smooth: code autocompletes with a few keystrokes. This gives the impression of momentum, but the early speed gains are often followed by cycles of editing, testing, and reworking that eat into any gains. This pattern is echoed both in conversations we've had with Fastly developers and in many of the comments we received in our survey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One respondent put it this way: âAn AI coding tool like GitHub Copilot greatly helps my workflow by suggesting code snippets and even entire functions. However, it once generated a complex algorithm that seemed correct but contained a subtle bug, leading to several hours of debugging.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another noted: âThe AI tool saves time by using boilerplate code, but it also needs manual fixes for inefficiencies, which keep productivity in check.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, AI still seems to improve developer job satisfaction. Nearly 80% of developers say AI tools make coding more enjoyable. For some, itâs about skipping grunt work. For others, it might be the dopamine rush of code on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âIt helps me complete a task that Iâm stuck with. It allows me to find the answers necessary to finish the task,â one survey respondent says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enjoyment doesnât equal efficiency, but in a profession wrestling with burnout and backlogs, that morale boost might still count for something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Hidden Cost of AI Coding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fastlyâs survey also explored developer awareness of green codingâthe practice of writing energy-efficient softwareâ and the energy cost behind AI coding tools. The practice of green coding goes up sharply with experience. Just over 56% of junior developers say they actively consider energy use in their work, while nearly 80% among mid- and senior-level engineers consider this when coding.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers are very aware of the environmental cost of AI tools: roughly two-thirds of developers across all experience levels said they know that these tools can carry a significant carbon footprint. Only a small minority (under 8% even at the most junior levels) were completely unaware. Altogether, the data suggests that sustainability is increasingly embedded in developer culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This survey was conducted by Fastly from July 10 to July 14, 2025, with 791 professional developers. All respondents confirm that writing or reviewing code is a core part of their job. The survey is distributed in the US and quality-controlled for accuracy, though, as with all self-reported data, some bias is possible.Â&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a tutorial for the Jujutsu version control system. It requires no previous experience with Git or any other version control system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, most Jujutsu tutorials are targeted at experienced Git users, teaching them how to transfer their existing Git skills over to Jujutsu. This tutorial is my attempt to fill the void of beginner learning material for Jujutsu. If you are already experienced with Git, I recommend Steve Klabnik's tutorial instead of this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tutorial requires you to work in the terminal. Don't worry, there's a chapter covering some terminal basics in case you're not 100% comfortable with that yet. The commands I tell you to run will often only work on Unix-like operating systems like Linux and Mac. If you're on Windows (and can't switch to Linux), consider using WSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to read this tutorial&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tutorial is split into levels, which are the top-level chapters in the sidebar. The idea is that once you complete a level, you should probably put this tutorial away for a while and practice what you've learned. Once you're comfortable with those skills, come back for the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one exception to this: If you're here because you need to collaborate with other people, you should complete the levels 1 and 2 right away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's an overview of the planned levels:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Level&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The bare minimum to get started. This is only enough for the simplest use cases where you're working alone. For example, students who track and submit their homework with a Git repository can get by with only this.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The bare minimum for any sort of collaboration. Students who are working on a group project and professional software developers need to know this. Going further is highly recommended, but you can take a break after this.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Basic problem solving skills like conflict resolution and restoring files from history. Without this knowledge, it's only a matter of time until you run into trouble. Completing this level is comparable to the skill level of the average software developer.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;History rewriting skills. These will allow you to iterate toward a polished version history, which pays dividends long-term. Some projects require you to have these skills in order to meet their quality standards.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Productivity boosters, advanced workflows, lesser-known CLI functions and a little VCS theory. Completing this level means you have mastered Jujutsu.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Additional topics that only come up in specific situations: tags, submodules, workspaces etc. Consider skimming the list of topics and come back once you have an actual need for it.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only a few levels are complete right now, the rest are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reset your progress&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout the tutorial, you will build an example repository. Later chapters depend on the state of previous ones. Losing the state of the example repo can therefore block you from making smooth progress. This might happen for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You use the example repo for practice and experimentation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You switch to a different computer or reinstall the OS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You intentionally delete it to clean up your home directory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The tutorial is updated significantly while you're taking a break.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, there is a script which automates the task of resetting your progress to the start of any chapter. To identify the chapter you want to continue with, the script expects a keyword as an argument. Each chapter includes its precise reset command at the beginning, so you can easily copy-paste it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The script is not complicated, you can verify that it's not doing anything malicious. Basically, it's just the list of commands I tell you to run manually. For convenience, it's included in the expandable text box below. You can also download the script here and then execute it locally once you have inspected it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Both this tutorial and Jujutsu are still evolving. In order to keep your Jujutsu knowledge updated, subscribe to releases of the tutorial's GitHub repo. You will be notified of important changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A new level becomes available.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An existing level is changed significantly.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I especially intend to keep this tutorial updated as new version of Jujutsu come out with features and changes that are relevant to the tutorial's content. I consider this tutorial up-to-date with the latest version of Jujutsu (&lt;code&gt;0.32&lt;/code&gt;) as of August 2025.
If that's more than a couple months in the past, I probably stopped updating this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can subscribe to these updates by visiting the GitHub repo and clicking on "Watch", "Custom" and then selecting "Releases".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Help make this tutorial better&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you find a typo, you can suggest a fix directly by clicking on the "edit" icon in the top-right corner. If you have general suggestions for improvement, please open an issue. I am also very interested in experience reports, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do you have any frustrations with Jujutsu which the tutorial did not help you overcome?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Was there a section that wasn't explained clearly? (If you didn't understand something, it's probably the tutorial's fault, not yours!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Did you complete a level but didn't feel like you had the skills that were promised in the level overview?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is there something missing that's not being taught but should?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do you feel like the content could be structured better?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for helping me improve this tutorial!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is version control and why should you use it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will assume you're using version control for software development, but it can be used for other things as well. For example, authoring professionally formatted documents with tools like Typst. The source of this tutorial is stored in version control too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What these scenarios have in common is that a large body of work (mostly in the form of text) is slowly being expanded and improved over time. You don't want to lose any of it and you want to be able to go back to previous states of your work. Often, several people need to work on the project at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A general-purpose backup solution can keep a few copies of your files around. A graphical document editor can allow multiple people to edit the text simultaneously. But sometimes, you need a sharper knife. Jujutsu is the sharpest knife available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Jujutsu instead of Git?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Git is by far the most commonly used VCS in the software development industry. So why not use that? Using the most popular thing has undeniable benefits. There is lots of learning material, lots of people can help you with problems, lots of other tools integrate with it etc. Why make life harder on yourself by using a lesser-known alternative?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's my elevator pitch:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jujutsu is compatible with Git. You're not actually losing anything by using Jujutsu. You can work with it on any existing project that uses Git for version control without issues. Tools that integrate with Git mostly work just as well with Jujutsu.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jujutsu is easier to learn than Git. (That is, assuming I did a decent job writing this tutorial.) Git is known for its complicated, unintuitive user interface. Jujutsu gives you all the functionality of Git with a lot less complexity. Experienced users of Git usually don't care about this, because they've paid the price of learning Git already. (I was one of these people once.) But you care!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jujutsu is more powerful than Git. Despite the fact that it's easier to learn and more intuitive, it actually has loads of awesome capabilities for power users that completely leave Git in the dust. Don't worry, you don't have to use that power right away. But you can be confident that if your VCS-workflow becomes more demanding in the future, Jujutsu will have your back. This is not a watered-down "we have Git at home" for slow learners!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learning Jujutsu instead of Git as your first VCS does have some downsides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When talking about version control with peers, they will likely use Git-centric vocabulary. Jujutsu shares a lot of Git's concepts, but there are also differences. Translating between the two in conversation can add some mental overhead. (solution: convince your peers to use Jujutsu 😉)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jujutsu is relatively new and doesn't cover 100% of the features of Git yet. When you do run into the rare problem where Jujutsu doesn't have an answer, you can always fall back to use Git directly, which works quite seamlessly. Still, having to use two tools instead of one is slightly annoying. I plan to teach such Git features in this tutorial in later levels. The tutorial should be a one-stop-shop for all Jujutsu users.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The command line interface of Jujutsu is not yet stable. That means in future versions of Jujutsu, some commands might work a little differently or be renamed. I personally don't think this should scare you away. Many people including me have used Jujutsu as a daily driver for a long time. Whenever something did change, my reaction was usually: "Great, that was one of the less-than-perfect parts of Jujutsu! Now it's even more intuitive than before!" Consider subscribing to GitHub releases of this tutorial. You will be notified if new versions of Jujutsu change something in a way that's relevant to what you learned in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite some downsides, I think the benefits are well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN! We’re Alessia and Elia, the founders of VibeFlow (&lt;/p&gt;https://vibeflow.ai&lt;p&gt;). VibeFlow lets semi-technical people (i.e. people with some technical skill but who are not professional programmers) build full-stack web apps from natural language prompts, while making the underlying business logic clear and editable as a visual workflow. Demo video: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CwWd3-b1JI&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem we’re trying to solve: today, people who want to build apps without coding often have to stitch together multiple tools, e.g. using Lovable for the frontend, n8n for workflows, and Supabase for the database. That creates data silos and leaves builders with fragile apps that break in production, don’t scale, and aren’t safe. We saw YouTube tutorials teaching people how to duct-tape these together just to get a functional app running. As engineers building no-code tools, we realized that people wanted the power of AI-generated UIs but also the ability to see and control their backend workflows and data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our solution is to generate the whole app at once, and represent it as a visual workflow. Users describe what they want in English (“I need a chat widget with an AI agent”) and VibeFlow generates both the interface and the logic. That logic shows up as a workflow graph they can edit visually or by giving new instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use Convex (https://www.convex.dev/) as backend. The generation of the backend code is fully deterministic, we map workflow graphs to code templates. This makes deployments predictable and avoids the hallucinated, black-box code you often get from AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workflow representation: the logic is a directed graph where each node can be customized. We currently support CRUD operations and agent components. Any changes to the graph compiles directly back into code, so you always own the underlying logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontend: generated via AI and directly linked to workflow outputs, so it always stays in sync with the business logic. Changes to the frontend can be made through a chat interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semi-technical builders can create maintainable apps (not opaque “magic”), and technical folks can still inspect the code and architecture. Compared to Bubble/Webflow, the interface is simpler; compared to Zapier, the workflows have an output code; and compared to AI coding assistants, you get an automatic backend plugged in with no black-box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try it here: https://app.vibeflow.ai/. The demo video is https://youtu.be/-CwWd3-b1JI We'd love to hear from the HN community, whether you're a builder who's struggled with stitching tools together, a developer who's seen the pain points in no-code platforms, or someone curious about where AI-powered app generation is heading - we're eager for your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A while ago I treated you to a dissertation entitled “Does The Sun Set On The British Empire?”, and concluded that it doesn’t. The UK’s widely scattered overseas territories, sparse though they are, mean that the sun is still always shining, somewhere in the world, over British territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important territories in maintaining this late-empire sunlight are the Pitcairn Islands, in the Pacific, and the British Indian Ocean Territory, in the Indian Ocean. To illustrate that, I offered the sunlight chart below, showing how Pitcairn and BIOT catch the sunlight when it’s dark in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, as my map at the head of this post shows, BIOT is pivotal. There, I’ve plotted the distribution of light and darkness, across the globe, at 02:15 Greenwich Mean Time, during the June solstice of 2024.*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here’s the situation at the December solstice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just after the sun sets in Pitcairn, it’s dark over every British territory except BIOT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m revisiting the situation because the UK government has announced plans to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago, which houses BIOT, to Mauritius. The announcement was made in October 2024, but the original agreement has now been contested by a new government in Mauritius. And the situation is further complicated by the fact that BIOT houses a large US military base on the island of Diego Garcia, so the new Trump administration also has a say in the process. (Meanwhile, the unfortunate Chagossians, evicted from their homeland in 1968 to make way for the military base, have so far been given no voice in the negotiations.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current proposal suggests that the military base would be maintained under a long-term lease agreement, in which case British sovereignty would be lost, and BIOT would cease to exist. At that point, the role of easternmost British territory would fall to the Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs), in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SBAs are worth a few paragraphs, both because they’re relatively obscure, and because their existence, as sovereign military territories, perhaps has some slight relevance to how the situation on Diego Garcia might play out, should the Trump administration raise strong objections to the current plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SBAs came into existence when Cyprus gained its independence from the UK in 1960. Under the Treaty of Establishment, the UK retained sovereignty over about 250 square kilometres of the island, in two separate areas—the Western Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri, and the Eastern Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia. These have extremely complicated boundaries, designed to avoid Cypriot settlements while including British military establishments. The Eastern SBA contains three Cypriot enclaves—the towns of Ormideia and Xylotymbou, and the area surrounding the Dhekelia power station (which is crossed by a British road). It also features a long northward extension along the road to the village of Ayios Nikolaos, which now houses a signals intelligence unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the whole border situation became even more complicated after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, which has left the island traversed by a UN buffer zone. British territory, including the Ayios Nikolaos road, forms part of the buffer zone. Elsewhere, the Turkish-controlled town of Kokkina has its very own buffer zone. Here’s an overview map, followed by some detail of the SBAs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Interestingly, the British military settlements within the SBAs are referred to as cantonments, a military term which, to me at least, has something of a colonial ring to it, given its association with British rule in India.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relevance, here, to the current situation of Diego Garcia, is because the UK government made plans to hand the SBAs back to Cyprus in 1974, but were persuaded to retain sovereignty by the USA, which valued access to signals intelligence in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as a convenient location from which to fly, among other things, U2 spy planes. The difference, of course, is that the Cypriot government appears to have been compliant with that arrangement, whereas it seems unlikely, at time of writing, that the Mauritians would agree to such a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll see how it goes. Meanwhile, I’ve plotted another sunrise/sunset graph, showing how sunlight is handed off between the two key players in the absence of BIOT:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(For my sunlight calculation, I’ve plugged in the latitude and longitude of the easternmost part of the Eastern SBA—Ayios Nikolaos.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s close—in June there’s less than an hour when it’s dark in both Pitcairn and the SBAs. But, if BIOT goes, when the sun sets on Pitcairn, it will also set on (what’s left of) the British Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* I haven’t plotted British Antarctic Territory, because territorial claims in Antarctica are in abeyance under the Antarctic Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45084913</guid></item><item><title>Use One Big Server (2022)</title><link>https://specbranch.com/posts/one-big-server/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="dfdab7597d822fd7"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Use One Big Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of ink is spent on the "monoliths vs. microservices" debate, but the real issue behind this debate is about whether distributed system architecture is worth the developer time and cost overheads. By thinking about the real operational considerations of our systems, we can get some insight into whether we actually need distributed systems for most things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have all gotten so familiar with virtualization and abstractions between our software and the servers that run it. These days, "serverless" computing is all the rage, and even "bare metal" is a class of virtual machine. However, every piece of software runs on a server. Since we now live in a world of virtualization, most of these servers are a lot bigger and a lot cheaper than we actually think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Meet Your Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a picture of a server used by Microsoft Azure with AMD CPUs. Starting from the left, the big metal fixture on the left (with the copper tubes) is a heatsink, and the metal boxes that the copper tubes are attached to are heat exchangers on each CPU. The CPUs are AMD's third generation server CPU, each of which has the following specifications:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;64 cores&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;128 threads&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;~2-2.5 GHz clock&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cores capable of 4-6 instructions per clock cycle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;256 MB of L3 cache&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, this server has 128 cores with 256 simultaneous threads. With all of the cores working together, this server is capable of 4 TFLOPs of peak double precision computing performance. This server would sit at the top of the top500 supercomputer list in early 2000. It would take until 2007 for this server to leave the top500 list. Each CPU core is substantially more powerful than a single core from 10 years ago, and boasts a much wider computation pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above and below each CPU is the memory: 16 slots of DDR4-3200 RAM per socket. The largest capacity "cost effective" DIMMs today are 64 GB. Populated cost-efficiently, this server can hold 1 TB of memory. Populated with specialized high-capacity DIMMs (which are generally slower than the smaller DIMMs), this server supports up to 8 TB of memory total. At DDR4-3200, with a total of 16 memory channels, this server will likely see ~200 Gbps of memory throughput across all of its cores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of I/O, each CPU offers 64 PCIe gen 4 lanes. With 128 PCIe lanes total, this server is capable of supporting 30 NVMe SSDs plus a network card. Typical configurations you can buy will offer slots for around 16 SSDs or disks. The final thing I wanted to point out in this picture is in the top right, the network card. This server is likely equipped with a 50-100 Gbps network connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Capabilities of One Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One server today is capable of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Serving video files at 400 Gbps (now 800 Gbps)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 million IOPS on a NoSQL database&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;70k IOPS in PostgreSQL&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Compiling the linux kernel in 20 seconds&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rendering 4k video with x264 at 75 FPS&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among other things. There are a lot of public benchmarks these days, and if you know how your service behaves, you can probably find a similar benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Cost of One Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a large hosting provider, OVHCloud, you can rent an HGR-HCI-6 server with similar specifications to the above, with 128 physical cores (256 threads), 512 GB of memory, and 50 Gbps of bandwidth for $1,318/month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving to the popular budget option, Hetzner, you can rent a smaller server with 32 physical cores and 128 GB of RAM for about â¬140.00/month. This is a smaller server than the one from OVHCloud (1/4 the size), but it gives you some idea of the price spread between hosting providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In AWS, one of the largest servers you can rent is the m6a.metal server. It offers 50 Gbps of network bandwidth, 192 vCPUs (96 physical cores), and 768 GB of memory, and costs $8.2944/hour in the US East region. This comes out to $6,055/month. The cloud premium is real!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar server, with 128 physical cores and 512 GB of memory (as well as appropriate NICs, SSDs, and support contracts), can be purchased from the Dell website for about $40,000. However, if you are going to spend this much on a server, you should probably chat with a salesperson to make sure you are getting the best deal you can. You will also need to pay to host this server and connect it to a network, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In comparison, buying servers takes about 8 months to break even compared to using cloud servers, and 30 months to break even compared to renting. Of course, buying servers has a lot of drawbacks, and so does renting, so going forward, we will think a little bit about the "cloud premium" and whether you should be willing to pay it (spoiler alert: the answer is "yes, but not as much as the cloud companies want you to pay").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thinking about the Cloud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "cloud era" began in earnest around 2010. At the time, the state of the art CPU was an 8-core Intel Nehalem CPU. Hyperthreading had just begun, so that 8-core CPU offered a whopping 16 threads. Hardware acceleration was about to arrive for AES encryption, and vectors were 128 bits wide. The largest CPUs had 24 MB of cache, and your server could fit a whopping 256 GB of DDR3-1066 memory. If you wanted to store data, Seagate had just begun to offer a 3 TB hard drive. Each core offered 4 FLOPs per cycle, meaning that your 8-core server running at 2.5 GHz offered a blazing fast 80 GFLOPs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The boom in distributed computing rode on this wave: if you wanted to do anything that involved retrieval of data, you needed a lot of disks to get the storage throughput you want. If you wanted to do large computations, you generally needed a lot of CPUs. This meant that you needed to coordinate between a lot of CPUs to get most things done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since that time began, the size of servers has increased a lot, and SSDs have increased available IOPS by a factor of at least 100, but the size of mainstream VMs and containers hasn't increased much, and we still use virtualized drives that perform more like hard drives than SSDs (although this gap is closing).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;One Server (Plus a Backup) is Usually Plenty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are doing anything short of video streaming, and you have under 10k QPS, one server will generally be fine for most web services. For really simple services, one server could even make it to a million QPS or so. Very few web services get this much traffic - if you have one, you know about it. Even if you're serving video, running only one server for your control plane is very reasonable. A benchmark can help you determine where you are. Alternatively, you can use common benchmarks of similar applications, or tables of common performance numbers to estimate how big of a machine you might need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Tall is Better than Wide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you need a cluster of computers, if one server is not enough, using fewer larger servers will often be better than using a large fleet of small machines. There is non-zero overhead to coordinate a cluster, and that overhead is frequently O(n) on each server. To reduce this overhead, you should generally prefer to use a few large servers than to use many small servers. In the case of things like serverless computing, where you allocate tiny short-lived containers, this overhead accounts for a large fraction of the cost of use. On the other extreme end, coordinating a cluster of one computer is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Big Servers and Availability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big drawback of using a single big server is availability. Your server is going to need downtime, and it is going to break. Running a primary and a backup server is usually enough, keeping them in different datacenters. A 2x2 configuration should appease the truly paranoid: two servers in a primary datacenter (or cloud provider) and two servers in a backup datacenter will give you a lot of redundancy. If you want a third backup deployment, you can often make that smaller than your primary and secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, you may still have to be concerned about correlated hardware failures. Hard drives (and now SSDs) have been known to occasionally have correlated failures: if you see one disk fail, you are a lot more likely to see a second failure before getting back up if your disks are from the same manufacturing batch. Services like Backblaze overcome this by using many different models of disks from multiple manufacturers. Hacker news learned this the hard way recently when the primary and backup server went down at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are using a hosting provider which rents pre-built servers, it is prudent to rent two different types of servers in each of your primary and backup datacenters. This should avoid almost every failure mode present in modern systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use the Cloud, but don't be too Cloudy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A combination of availability and ease of use is one of the big reasons why I (and most other engineers) like cloud computers. Yes, you pay a significant premium to rent the machines, but your cloud provider has so much experience building servers that you don't even see most failures, and for the other failures, you can get back up and running really quickly by renting a new machine in their nearly-limitless pool of compute. It is their job to make sure that you don't experience downtime, and while they don't always do it perfectly, they are pretty good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hosting providers who are willing to rent you a server are a cheaper alternative to cloud providers, but these providers can sometimes have poor quality and some of them don't understand things like network provisioning and correlated hardware failures. Also, moving from one rented server to a larger one is a lot more annoying than resizing a cloud VM. Cloud servers have a price premium for a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, when you deal with clouds, your salespeople will generally push you towards "cloud-native" architecture. These are things like microservices in auto-scaling VM groups with legions of load balancers between them, and vendor-lock-in-enhancing products like serverless computing and managed high-availability databases. There is a good reason that cloud salespeople are the ones pushing "cloud architecture" - it's better for them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom is that using cloud architecture is good because it lets you scale up effortlessly. There are good reasons to use cloud-native architecture, but serving lots of people is not one of them: most services can serve millions of people at a time with one server, and will never give you a surprise five-figure bill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why Should I Pay for Peak Load?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One common criticism of the "one big server" approach is that you now have to pay for your peak usage instead of paying as you go for what you use. Thus, serverless computing or fleets of microservice VMs more closely align your costs with your profit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, since all of your services run on servers (whether you like it or not), someone in that supply chain is charging you based on their peak load. Part of the "cloud premium" for load balancers, serverless computing, and small VMs is based on how much extra capacity your cloud provider needs to build in order to handle their peak load. You're paying for someone's peak load anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that if your workload is exceptionally bursty - like a simulation that needs to run once and then turn off forever - you should prefer to reach for "cloudy" solutions, but if your workload is not so bursty, you will often have a cheaper system (and an easier time building it) if you go for few large servers. If your cloud provider's usage is more bursty than yours, you are going to pay that premium for no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This premium applies to VMs, too, not just cloud services. However, if you are running a cloud VM 24/7, you can avoid paying the "peak load premium" by using 1-year contracts or negotiating with a salesperson if you are big enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally, the burstier your workload is, the more cloudy your architecture should be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How Much Does it Cost to be Cloudy?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being cloudy is expensive. Generally, I would anticipate a 5-30x price premium depending on what you buy from a cloud company, and depending on the baseline. Not 5-30%, a factor of between 5 and 30.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the pricing of AWS lambda: $0.20 per 1M requests + $0.0000166667 per GB-second of RAM. I am using pricing for an x86 CPU here to keep parity with the m6a.metal instance we saw above. Large ARM servers and serverless ARM compute are both cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming your server costs $8.2944/hour, and is capable of 1k QPS with 768 GB of RAM:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1k QPS is 60k queries per minute, or 3.6M queries per hour&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each query here gets 0.768 GB-seconds of RAM (amortized)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Replacing this server would cost about $46/hour using serverless computing&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The price premium for serverless computing over the instance is a factor of 5.5. If you can keep that server over 20% utilization, using the server will be cheaper than using serverless computing. This is before any form of savings plan you can apply to that server - if you can rent those big servers from the spot market or if you compare to the price you can get with a 1-year contract, the price premium is even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you compare to the OVHCloud rental price for the same server, the price premium of buying your compute through AWS lambda is a factor of 25&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are considering renting a server from a low-cost hosting provider or using AWS lambda, you should prefer the hosting provider if you can keep the server operating at 5% capacity!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, note that the actual QPS number doesn't matter: if the $8.2944/hour server is capable of 100k QPS, the query would use 100x less memory-time, meaning that you would arrive at the same 5.5x (or 25x) premium. Of course, you should scale the size of the server to fit your application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Common Objections to One Big Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you propose using the one big server approach, you will often get pushback from people who are more comfortable with the cloud, prefer to be fashionable, or have legitimate concerns. Use your judgment when you think about it, but most people vastly underestimate how much "cloud architecture" actually costs compared to the underlying compute. Here are some common objections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;But if I use Cloud Architecture, I Don't Have to Hire Sysadmins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes you do. They are just now called "Cloud Ops" and are under a different manager. Also, their ability to read the arcane documentation that comes from cloud companies and keep up with the corresponding torrents of updates and deprecations makes them 5x more expensive than system administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;But if I use Cloud Architecture, I Don't Have to Do Security Updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes you do. You may have to do fewer of them, but the ones you don't have to do are the easy ones to automate. You are still going to share in the pain of auditing libraries you use, and making sure that all of your configurations are secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;But if I use Cloud Architecture, I Don't Have to Worry About it Going Down&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "high availability" architectures you get from using cloudy constructs and microservices just about make up for the fragility they add due to complexity. At this point, if you use two different cloud regions or two cloud providers, you can generally assume that is good enough to avoid your service going down. However, cloud providers have often had global outages in the past, and there is no reason to assume that cloud datacenters will be down any less often than your individual servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that we are trying to prevent correlated failures. Cloud datacenters have a lot of parts that can fail in correlated ways. Hosting providers have many fewer of these parts. Similarly, complex cloud services, like managed databases, have more failure modes than simple ones (VMs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;But I can Develop More Quickly if I use Cloud Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then do it, and just keep an eye on the bill and think about when it's worth it to switch. This is probably the strongest argument in favor of using cloudy constructs. However, if you don't think about it as you grow, you will likely end up burning a lot of money on your cloudy architecture long past the time to switch to something more boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;My Workload is Really Bursty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloud away. That is a great reason to use things like serverless computing. One of the big benefits of cloud architecture constructs is that the scale down really well. If your workload goes through long periods of idleness punctuated with large unpredictable bursts of activity, cloud architecture probably works really well for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What about CDNs?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's impossible to get the benefits of a CDN, both in latency improvements and bandwidth savings, with one big server. This is also true of other systems that need to be distributed, like backups. Thankfully CDNs and backups are competitive markets, and relatively cheap. These are the kind of thing to buy rather than build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Note On Microservices and Monoliths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thinking about "one big server" naturally lines up with thinking about monolithic architectures. However, you don't need to use a monolith to use one server. You can run many containers on one big server, with one microservice per container. However, microservice architectures in general add a lot of overhead to a system for dubious gain when you are running on one big server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you experience growing pains, and get close to the limits of your current servers, today's conventional wisdom is to go for sharding and horizontal scaling, or to use a cloud architecture that gives you horizontal scaling "for free." It is often easier and more efficient to scale vertically instead. Using one big server is comparatively cheap, keeps your overheads at a minimum, and actually has a pretty good availability story if you are careful to prevent correlated hardware failures. It's not glamorous and it won't help your resume, but one big server will serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developed by the Deep Space Exploration Laboratory (DSEL) in Hefei, Anhui province, the system functions as a 3D printing device powered by concentrated solar heat. It employs a parabolic reflector to gather solar radiation, which is then funneled through fiber optic bundles. At the focus point, light intensity exceeds 3,000 times the standard level, reaching temperatures over 1,300 C to melt lunar regolith.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to senior engineer Yang Honglun, the machine uses no additives - relying entirely on lunar soil. The bricks produced are dense and robust, suitable not only for shelter construction but also for roads and platforms on the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project spanned two years of research and development. Key challenges included transporting and melting variable lunar soil compositions and achieving efficient solar energy transmission. To address this, the team created multiple types of simulated lunar soil for extensive trials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the technology is a milestone, Yang emphasized that lunar soil bricks alone cannot sustain pressure in the moon's vacuum and low-gravity environment. Instead, the bricks will act as protective layers over pressure-retaining habitat modules made of rigid and inflatable structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He outlined a broader vision for lunar construction involving brick manufacturing, modular component integration, and structural validation under true lunar surface conditions. These efforts aim to enable full-scale surface construction supported by automated robots and the brick-making device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This development aligns with China's plans for the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), a joint venture with 17 countries and over 50 research bodies. Scheduled in two phases, ILRS will establish a base in the lunar south pole region by 2035, with expansions in the 2040s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In preparation, Chinese astronauts aboard the nation's space station will expose simulated lunar bricks - delivered by the Tianzhou 8 cargo spacecraft in November 2024 - to space conditions. These experiments will assess thermal durability, mechanical integrity, and radiation shielding to inform future lunar base construction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of my Rock 5 ITX+. It wraps an ATX power connector, a 4-pin Molex, PoE support, 32 GB of eMMC, front-panel USB 2.0, and two Gen 3×2 M.2 slots around a Rockchip 3588 SoC that can slot into any Mini-ITX case. Thing is, I never put it in a case because the microSD slot lives on the side of the board, and pulling the case out and removing the side panel to install a new OS got old with a quickness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I originally wanted to rackmount the critter, but adding a deracking difficulty multiplier to the microSD slot minigame seemed a bit souls-like for my taste. So what am I going to do? Grab a microSD extender and hang that out the back? Nay! I’m going to neuralyze the SPI flash and install some Kelvin Timeline firmware that will allow me to boot and install generic ARM Linux images from USB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least, that’s the plan 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;EDK2 RK3588&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDK2-RK3588 is a UEFI firmware implementation based on EDK2 for various RK3588 boards. It delivers a PC-like, standardised boot experience, supporting multiple operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, BSD, and VMware ESXi. At least, that’s what it says on the tin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, I could write the EDK2 firmware to a microSD and try before you buy. Welp, that’s not going to work on the Rock 5 ITX+ because it’s a wee bit, what’s a polite way to put this, special. Not only does the microSD trick not work, it also refuses to let me boot the EDK2 firmware from eMMC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to break out the neuralyzer!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ARMBIAN&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To pull off this roundabout feat of engineering, I first need to boot the Rock 5 ITX+ to a desktop, and there is exactly one correct answer to that problem: Armbian 25.2.2 Noble Gnome with kernel 6.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once booted to the desktop, it’s time to crack open a copy of Chromium, head over to the EDK2-RK3588 GitHub page, and download the latest rock-5-itx UEFI release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember the “specialness” I talked about earlier? Yeah, the Rock 5 ITX+ exposes the SPI flash as a standard 17 MB block device, meaning I can flash the UEFI image with GNOME Disks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted, I’m still flashing the SPI, so I had to remind myself not to freak out when it seized up at the start, then proceeded to write the image at the speed of smell. The whole process ended up taking about a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that’s left to do at this point is power down the system, pop out the microSD, and reapply the electrons. Saying a prayer to an elder deity is optional but highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;UEFI BOOT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a mild panic attack, I realised the EDK2 boot screen only shows up on when connected to the first HDMI output. I was finally greeted by a Radxa splash screen, and tapping Escape got me into the setup menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a gang of settings to play around with, but for the time being I’m only focused on one, ACPI / Device Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s located in Device Manager &amp;gt; Rockchip Platform Configuration &amp;gt; ACPI / Device Tree. Here I could tell the Rock 5 ITX+ to boot using ACPI, Device Tree, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided to keep the Config Table Mode set to both, with Device Tree Configuration set to Mainline, and DTB override and firmware fixups enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GENERIC ARM LINUX&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole point of this experiment was to be able to download generic ARM images for any distribution and install them as I would on my x86-64 desktop PC. The thing is, there’s a miniboss hiding in plain sight on the EDK2-RK3588 GitHub page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, if I want a hardware-accelerated desktop (or anything else), I’m going to need a distribution shipping with kernel 6.15+, and while that might seem comical to anyone reading from the future, Debian 13 was released this week and it’s rocking 6.12.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel 6.15+ requirement rules out the current releases of Armbian, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Fedora. Thankfully, both Ubuntu (Daily) and Fedora (Rawhide) have bleeding-edge builds, so I’m crossing my pinky toes, hoping that one of them works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FEDORA RAWHIDE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard of Rawhide, it’s bleeding-edge Fedora, aimed at advanced users, testers, and anyone trying to shove Fedora onto an ARM SBC running EDK2 firmware in the glorious year of his noodly appendage, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the gate, Fedora was being fussy, requiring me to switch the Config Table to Device Tree just to get a display. Even then, it took a reboot (or two) before finally gracing me with display output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I defeated GRUB, it was smooth sailing. Pick a language, select the installation drive, agree to murderate some databits, and exit to the desktop. All that’s left to do is power off the system, remove the flash drive, and reapply the electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the reboot, I was greeted by a non-functioning GNOME desktop. Well, it wasn’t completely broken, as I could wiggle the mouse pointer, and that is how things remained until Mr 🙁 showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the superpowers you develop while working with ARM SBCs is the ability to get up and walk away in case it’s having an extended think, knowing the solution is simply to wait it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After however long it took me to make a cup of tea, I came back to a task failed successfully and was finally able to complete the setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick poke around the GNOME Control Center revealed that networking, power, and display options were intact and operational.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I clicked on sound. I’m going to assume this is solvable by enabling some third-party repository, but that’s for someone else to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;UBUNTU 25.10&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve talked an egregious amount of smack about Ubuntu over the decades, 73.6% of it deserved, but credit where it’s due: they’ve put serious time and energy into making their desktop work on both ARM and RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I wasn’t terribly surprised that GRUB appeared after I reset the EDK2 firmware to its defaults, followed by the installer’s splash screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have installed Ubuntu before, there is nothing of note here. Like Fedora, it offered the option to install the system on NVMe or eMMC, along with settings to enable third-party repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another rummage in the GNOME Control Center revealed that networking, power, and display options were intact and operational. Unlike Fedora, Ubuntu dispelled the myth that sound does not work on Linux. At least on ARM, out of the box… on a bleeding edge distro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also want to point out that Vulkan worked on both Ubuntu 25.10 and Fedora Rawhide. The open-source drivers still have some catching up to do, but they are most certainly getting there and are more than enough to provide a smooth desktop experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;NETBSD?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also grabbed a copy of NetBSD daily, and it booted right up. I didn’t bother trying to install it, but it picked up the ethernoodles, so you could probably get up to, something?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;VERDICT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all started because I wanted to put the Rock 5 ITX+ into a rackmount case and have a way to swap out the OS without pulling it from the rack and fiddling with the SD card. And yes, while writing this, all I can think about is how long it will take for someone to point out the existence of SD card extenders in the YouTube comments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won’t fault them for doing so. A simple SD extender plus a little arts and crafts with a Dremel would have been my solution if I needed a working fix yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I really wanted to see where EDK2 RK3588 stands, since Collabora is hard at work upstreaming support for the RK3588 to the Linux kernel, and that’s going to be the SoC where everything JustWorks™ in a year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, EDK2 + RK3588 isn’t there yet, but it’s not that far off either. It’s the worst of all states, kinda works if you squint a little. The big hangup is kernel 6.15, but that only matters if you need HDMI output with hardware acceleration. Building a headless fileserver? You’re already good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks like the Rock 5 ITX+ has escaped the rack, for now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sideloading has been a hot topic for the last decade. Most recently, Google has announced further restrictions on the practice in Android. Many hundreds of comment threads have discussed these changes over the years. One point in particular is always made: âI should be able to run whatever code I want on hardware I ownâ. I agree entirely with this point, but within the context of this discussion itâs moot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âI should be able to run whatever code I want on hardware I ownâ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Google restricts your ability to install certain applications they arenât constraining what you can do with the hardware you own, they are constraining what you can do using the software they provide with said hardware. Itâs through this control of the operating system that Google is exerting control, not at the hardware layer. You often donât have full access to the hardware either and building new operating systems to run on mobile hardware is impossible, or at least much harder than it should be. This is a separate, and I think more fruitful, point to make. Apple is a better case study than Google here. Appleâs success with iOS partially derives from the tight integration of hardware and software. An iPhone without iOS is a very different product to what we understand an iPhone to be. Forcing Apple to change core tenets of iOS by legislative means would undermine what made the iPhone successful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You shouldnât take away from this that I am some stalwart defender of the two behemoths Apple and Google, far from it. However, our critique shouldnât be of the restrictions in place in the operating systems they provide â rather, it should focus on the ability to truly run any code we want on hardware we own. In this context this would mean having the ability and documentation to build or install alternative operating systems on this hardware. It should be possible to run Android on an iPhone and manufacturers should be required by law to provide enough technical support and documentation to make the development of new operating systems possible. If you want to play Playstation games on your PS5 you must suffer Sonyâs restrictions, but if you want to convert your PS5 into an emulator running Linux that should be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Process Monitor (Procmon) is a Linux reimagining of the classic Procmon tool from the Sysinternals suite of tools for Windows. Procmon provides a convenient and efficient way for Linux developers to trace the syscall activity on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OS: Ubuntu 18.04 lts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt;&amp;gt;= 3.14 (build-time only)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;libsqlite3-dev&lt;/code&gt;&amp;gt;= 3.22 (build-time only)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please see installation instructions here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please see build instructions here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Usage: procmon [OPTIONS]
   OPTIONS
      -h/--help                Prints this help screen
      -p/--pids                Comma separated list of process IDs to monitor
      -e/--events              Comma separated list of system calls to monitor
      -c/--collect [FILEPATH]  Option to start Procmon in a headless mode
      -f/--file FILEPATH       Open a Procmon trace file
      -l/--log FILEPATH        Log debug traces to file&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following traces all processes and syscalls on the system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo procmon&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following traces processes with process id 10 and 20:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo procmon -p 10,20&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following traces process 20 only syscalls read, write and open at:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo procmon -p 20 -e read,write,openat&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following traces process 35 and opens Procmon in headless mode to output all captured events to file &lt;code&gt;procmon.db&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo procmon -p 35 -c procmon.db&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following opens a Procmon &lt;code&gt;tracefile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;procmon.db&lt;/code&gt;, within the Procmon TUI:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;ASTORIA, CLATSOP COUNTY; 1800s:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Lewis and Clark marked their trail with laxatives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Audio version is not yet available&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;By Finn J.D. John&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Some people have stated that the Lewis and Clark Expedition would have been better off if they had taken a trained physician along to care for the numerous problems that they encountered. I totally disagree,” says physician and historian David Peck. “I think a trained physician would have been overly confident and possibly would have been much more aggressive in their treatment of illnesses, often times to the detriment of the patient.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In lieu of a trained physician, the Corps of Discovery’s leaders got some basic medical training, along with a bag full of the tools of allopathic intervention: lancets for bleeding patients, blister powder for inducing “heat,” opium products for relieving pain and inducing sleep â and purgatives.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Those purgatives are the heroes of our story today. They came in the form of beefy pills, about four times the size of a standard aspirin tablet, which Rush called “Dr. Rush’s Bilious Pills.” They contained about 10 grains of calomel and 10 to 15 grains of jalap.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Jalap, the powdered root of a Mexican variety of morning glory, is a natural laxative of considerable power.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And calomel ... ah, calomel. Calomel was the wonder drug of the age. Its chemical name is mercury chloride. In large doses (and they don’t get much larger than 10 grains, or 20 if a fellow takes two of them, as Dr. Rush recommended!) it functions as a savage purgative, causing lengthy and productive sessions in the outhouse and leaving a patient thoroughly depleted and hopefully in full restoration of his bile balance.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Calomel also was the only thing known to be effective against syphilis, which was always an issue with military outfits. Whether picked up from a friendly lady in a waterfront St. Louis “sporting house” before the journey, or from an equally friendly Native lady met along the way, syphilis went with soldiers like ice cold milk with an Oreo cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When symptoms broke out, the patient would be dosed with “thunder clappers” and slathered with topical mercury ointments until he started salivating ferociously, which was a symptom of mild mercury poisoning but at the time was considered a sure sign that the body was purging the sickness out of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And yes, a few of the men did end up needing treatment for syphilis. But everyone in the party needed a good laxative âon the regularâ (sorry about that). Week after week, hunting parties went out and brought back animals to eat. The explorers lived on almost nothing but meat.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And this low-fiber diet had predictable results.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It had another result, too, which was less predictable â although highly convenient for later historians. The fact is, mercury chloride is only slightly soluble in human digestion. Plus, the reason it works is, it irritates the tissues of the digestive tract severely, causing the body to expel it just as fast as it possibly can before more damage can be done. So, most of the calomel in any given “bilious pill” gets blown out post-haste in the ensuing “purge.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Then, once out of the body and in the earth, it lasts literally for centuries without breaking down or dissolving away.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;So as Lewis and Clark and their crew made their way across the continent, and across Oregon, they were unknowingly depositing a trail of heavy-metal laxatives along the way â a trail that historians and scientists have been able to detect and use to document almost their every, uh, movement.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pacto Visual&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What is Complexity?&lt;/head&gt;If we all knew, we would all be masters.&lt;p&gt;May 2020 an interesting proposal was suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I provided some constructive criticism on research paper A Metric of Chess Complexity by FM David Peng, as well as constructive criticism on the codebase used to validate this experiment. For many months I have refrained from further comment, and although code has not progressed, two things have:&lt;lb/&gt;1. Public interest in "complexity" as determined by ACPL (yuck).&lt;lb/&gt;2. Lichess has a blogging platform where I can properly address deficiencies in the research method and control the conversation which I start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;... so the time has come for me to share my remaining criticisms of this ambitious project. Previously I had shared some easier-to-address criticisms while privately I shared Peng's suggestion with the Lichess team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Golden Goose&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such a feature has the potential to revolutionize chess and would be invaluable to any chess website. Some specific applications include generating non-tactical puzzles (imagine tactics trainer for positional chess puzzles), creating chess computers that play with human personalities, and identifying concepts that are key to improvement at any rating level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is a window for us to learn more about the world around us. Marketing is about selling ideas to an audience. This statement, if true, would have already garnered interest by both scientists and business people, who by exerting a modicum of effort could easily develop and sell products based upon them. Further, if true, this could also inspire a black market of cheating software to help players identify the risk associated with cheating in particular positions. Peng's paper makes many similar promises to the above, so this raises the level of scrutiny I take to the rest of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Propositions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper specifies complexity in two different propositions:&lt;lb/&gt;a) Complexity is a 1-dimensional, transferable (teachable to a neural network) metric based upon centipawn loss as determined by some version(s) of Stockfish with or without a neural network.&lt;lb/&gt;b) By definition, complexity can be used in real time to determine how difficult a position is.&lt;lb/&gt;While some people's intuitions may support the notion that these propositions support or complement each other, I am unconvinced; regardless, it takes more than intuition to create useful tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Logic&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the above axioms were true, how many of these conclusions are logically valid?&lt;lb/&gt;1. Non-tactical puzzles could be generated by identifying challenging positions (as opposed to the current method which is based upon positions where the solution is superior in evaluation to other variations).&lt;lb/&gt;2. The current model for puzzle ratings (based upon "elo") takes many attempts to establish an initial puzzle rating.&lt;lb/&gt;3. Holistic opening preparation can be automated by software, making players understand openings rather than memorize them.&lt;lb/&gt;4. Interesting positions for books are the same as difficult positions, which are the same as complex positions.&lt;lb/&gt;5. By identifying positions which are difficult for low-rated players and easy for high-rated players, one could develop training materials to help players understand common key concepts.&lt;lb/&gt;6. By identifying positions which are difficult for low-rated players and easy for high-rated players, one could develop a diagnostic chess exam which identifies a player's rating and identifies key concepts for improvement.&lt;lb/&gt;7. Large databases contain additional tagged information, such as time control, which would produce significant insight into which positions can be played intuitively. Large databases also indicate player ratings and therefore somehow complexity can be used to identify unique strategies useful for playing at a rating advantage or disadvantage.&lt;lb/&gt;8. Chess players have human personalities.&lt;lb/&gt;9. Opening systems can be devised around an opponent's tendency to seek or to avoid complexity.&lt;lb/&gt;10. Chess players are likely to make errors in difficult positions, unlike engines, and therefore a complexity metric would be an invaluable tool.&lt;lb/&gt;11. Spectating (and honestly, post-game analysis) of top chess games could be enriched by displaying complexity information related to each position, informing spectators who otherwise look at engine evaluations and variations &amp;amp; jump to conclusions.&lt;lb/&gt;12. Complexity varies by variant; for example blitz and correspondence have different complexities for identical positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, conclusion#11 is valid and others require further research. Anyway, on to Peng's research...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper nearly predates efforts by DeepMind, the Leela Chess Zero team, and the Stockfish team which resulted in development of Stockfish-NNUE. We could not have anticipated such rapid developments! Many chess players had opinions that AlphaZero and Leela played much more human-like moves than traditional engines, in much the same manner that decades prior world champion Kasparov was astounded that Deep Blue played human-like sacrifices. Whatever conclusions are drawn may need to be updated since both Stockfish evaluations without NNUE, and Stockfish-NNUE evaluations, have rapidly changed (complementing Stockfish search changes and search parameter changes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Endgame Scaling&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stockfish evaluations in the middlegame are capped at 10 and in the endgame are capped at 100. As such, it seems unreasonable to deviate from prior research indicating the need for a sigmoid to normalize evaluations before classifying example input moves as blunders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Board Representation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing original research allows liberties in methods and models, although considerations offered here differ from those announced and discussed in public interviews by DeepMind's CEO. While I don't fully agree with DeepMind's emphasis on asymmetry and castling rights, I do question the need for an extra bit for White/Black to move. For example, the positions after 1. c3 e5 2. c4 (Black to move) and after 1. e4 c5 (White to move) should have the same relative evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Evaluation Skewness&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is ample prior research about ranking moves. In fact, Peng's research here is predicated on a notion that traditional engines sometimes indicate to spectators that two moves are equally good, despite one resulting in a more difficult position than the other. We cannot be fully certain that players in fact played the best moves, as this is the very concept we are trying to figure out how to measure! Regardless, we have to start somewhere, and this seems like a good first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could further nitpick... I criticize because I am impressed and I care about this subject. I am further impressed that results were split by "elo," leading to a discovery that some positions are difficult for all players, whereas some positions are more difficult for lower-rated players than for higher-rated players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible improvements could involve:&lt;lb/&gt;* Obtain segmented Stockfish evaluations (material, pawn structure, etc.) and WDL statistics&lt;lb/&gt;* Obtain Stockfish-NNUE evaluations and WDL predictions&lt;lb/&gt;* Model checks in sample input&lt;lb/&gt;* Model log(time remaining) in sample input&lt;lb/&gt;* Maybe bootstrap models based upon known pawn concepts&lt;lb/&gt;* Maybe include some human versus engine games. Some bots such as Boris-Trapsky and TurtleBot have personalities!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the suggestion and someday I hope to see Lichess.org or some other site implement a complexity metric before cheaters do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo credit: Pacto Visual&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;
