    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Dependency cooldowns are a free, easy, and incredibly effective way to mitigate the large majority of open source supply chain attacks. More individual projects should apply cooldowns (via tools like Dependabot and Renovate) to their dependencies, and packaging ecosystems should invest in first-class support for cooldowns directly in their package managers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âSupply chain securityâ is a serious problem. Itâs also seriously overhyped, in part because dozens of vendors have a vested financial interest in convincing your that their framing of the underlying problem1 is (1) correct, and (2) worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatâs consternating about this is that most open source supply chain attacks have the same basic structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An attacker compromises a popular open source project, typically via a stolen credential or CI/CD vulnerabilty (such as âpwn requestsâ in GitHub Actions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The attacker introduces a malicious change to the project and uploads it somewhere that will have maximum effect (PyPI, npm, GitHub releases, &amp;amp;c., depending on the target).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, the clock has started, as the attacker has moved into the public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users pick up the compromised version of the project via automatic dependency updates or a lack of dependency pinning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the aforementioned vendors are scanning public indices as well as customer repositories for signs of compromise, and provide alerts upstream (e.g. to PyPI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, vendors are incentivized to report quickly and loudly upstream, as this increases the perceived value of their services in a crowded field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upstreams (PyPI, npm, &amp;amp;c.) remove or disable the compromised package version(s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;End-user remediation begins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key thing to observe is that the gap between (1) and (2) can be very large2 (weeks or months), while the gap between (2) and (5) is typically very small: hours or days. This means that, once the attacker has moved into the actual exploitation phase, their window of opportunity to cause damage is pretty limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see this with numerous prominent supply chain attacks over the last 18 months3:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ultralytics (phase 2)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1 hour&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;3 days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;chalk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt; 12 hours&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Nx&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4 hours&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;rspack&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1 hour&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;num2words&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt; 12 hours&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Kong Ingress Controller&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;â 10 days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;web3.js&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5 hours&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Each of these attacks has significant downstream effect, of course, but only within their window of opportunity. Subsequent compromises from each, like Shai-Hulud, represent new windows of opportunity where the attackers regrouped and pivoted onto the next set of compromised credentials.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My takeaway from this: some windows of opportunity are bigger, but the majority of them are under a week long. Consequently, ordinary developers can avoid the bulk of these types of attacks by instituting cooldowns on their dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A âcooldownâ is exactly what it sounds like: a window of time between when a dependency is published and when itâs considered suitable for use. The dependency is public during this window, meaning that âsupply chain securityâ vendors can work their magic while the rest of us wait any problems out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love cooldowns for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Theyâre empirically effective, per above. They wonât stop all attackers, but they do stymie the majority of high-visibiity, mass-impact supply chain attacks that have become more common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Theyâre incredibly easy to implement. Moreover, theyâre literally free to implement in most cases: most people can use Dependabotâs functionality, Renovateâs functionality, or the functionality build directly into their package manager5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how simple it is in Dependabot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Rinse and repeat for other ecosystems as needed.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooldowns enforce positive behavior from supply chain security vendors: vendors are still incentivized to discover and report attacks quickly, but are not as incentivized to emit volumes of blogspam about âcriticalâ attacks on largely underfunded open source ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the very small sample set above, 8/10 attacks had windows of opportunity of less than a week. Setting a cooldown of 7 days would have prevented the vast majority of these attacks from reaching end users (and causing knock-on attacks, which several of these were). Increasing the cooldown to 14 days would have prevented all but 1 of these attacks6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooldowns are, obviously, not a panacea: some attackers will evade detection, and delaying the inclusion of potentially malicious dependencies by a week (or two) does not fundamentally alter the fact that supply chain security is a social trust problem, not a purely technical one. Still, an 80-90% reduction in exposure through a technique that is free and easy seems hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related to the above, itâs unfortunate that cooldowns arenât baked directly into more packaging ecosystems: Dependabot and Renovate are great, but even better would be if the package manager itself (as the source of ground truth) could enforce cooldowns directly (including of dependencies not introduced or bumped through automated flows).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem being, succinctly: modern software stacks are complex and opaque, with little to no difference in privilege between first-party code and third-party dependencies.Â ↩&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In part because of the prevalence of long-lived, overscoped credentials. Long-lived credentials let attackers operate on their own (comfortable) timelines; this is why Trusted Publishing is such a useful (but not wholly sufficient) technique for reducing the attackerâs attack staging window.Â ↩&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filippo Valsorda has an excellent compilation of recent supply chain compromises here.Â ↩&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The xz-utils attack is a significant outlier, both in its scope and the length of its window of opportunity. In this case, Iâve measured from the attackerâs first backdoored release (v5.6.0, 2024-02-24) to the time of rollback within Debian (2024-03-28).Â ↩&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, pnpmâs &lt;code&gt;minimumReleaseAge&lt;/code&gt;.
           uv also has &lt;code&gt;exclude-newer&lt;/code&gt;, 
           although this specifies an absolute cutoff rather than a rolling cooldown.Â ↩&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, the only attack that would have stymied a 14-day cooldown is xz-utils, which is also the most technically, logistically, and socially advanced of all of the attacks.Â ↩&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Make product worse, get money&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently asked why people seem to hate dating apps so much. In response, 80% of you emailed me some version of the following theory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The thing about dating apps is that if they do a good job and match people up, then the matched people will quit the app and stop paying. So they have an incentive to string people along but not to actually help people find long-term relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;May I explain why I don’t find this type of theory very helpful?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that I think it’s wrong, mind you. Rather, my objection is that while the theory is phrased in terms of dating apps, the same basic pattern applies to basically anyone who is trying to make money by doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, consider a pizza restaurant. Try these theories on for size:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pizza: “The thing about pizza restaurants is that if they use expensive ingredients or labor-intensive pizza-making techniques, then it costs more to make pizza. So they have an incentive to use low-cost ingredients and labor-saving shortcuts.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pizza II: “The thing about pizza restaurants is that if they have nice tables separated at a comfortable distance, then they can’t fit as many customers. So they have an incentive to use tiny tables and cram people in cheek by jowl.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pizza III: “The thing about pizza restaurants is that if they sell big pizzas, then people will eat them and stop being hungry, meaning they don’t buy additional pizza. So they have an incentive to serve tiny low-calorie pizzas.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See what I mean? You can construct similar theories for other domains, too:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cars: “The thing about automakers is that making cars safe is expensive. So they have an incentive to make unsafe cars.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Videos: “The thing about video streaming is that high-resolution video uses more expensive bandwidth. So they have an incentive to use low-resolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Blogging: “The thing about bloggers is that research is time-consuming. So they have an incentive to be sloppy about the facts.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Durability: “The thing about {lightbulb, car, phone, refrigerator, cargo ship} manufacturing is that if you make a {lightbulb, car, phone, refrigerator, cargo ship} that lasts a long time, then people won’t buy new ones. So there’s an incentive to make {lightbulbs, cars, phones, refrigerators, cargo ships} that break quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All these theories can be thought of as instances of two general patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Make product worse, get money: “The thing about selling goods or services is that making goods or services better costs money. So people have an incentive to make goods and services worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Raise price, get money: “The thing about selling goods and services is that if you raise prices, then you get more money. So people have an incentive to raise prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are these theories wrong? Not exactly. But it sure seems like something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure most pizza restauranteurs would be thrilled to sell lukewarm 5 cm cardboard discs for $300 each. They do in fact have an incentive to do that, just as predicted by these theories! Yet, in reality, pizza restaurants usually sell pizzas that are made out of food. So clearly these theories aren’t telling the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say you have a lucrative business selling 5 cm cardboard discs for $300. I am likely to think, “I like money. Why don’t I sell pizzas that are only mostly cardboard, but also partly made of flour? And why don’t I sell them for $200, so I can steal Valued Reader’s customers?” But if I did that, then someone else would probably set prices at only $100, or even introduce cardboard-free pizzas, and this would continue until hitting some kind of equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, producers want to charge infinity dollars for things that cost them zero dollars to make. But consumers want to pay zero dollars for stuff that’s infinitely valuable. It’s in the conflict between these desires that all interesting theories live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why I don’t think it’s helpful to point out that people have an incentive to make their products worse. Of course they do. The interesting question is, why are they able to get away with it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reasons stuff is bad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First reason stuff is bad: People are cheap&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are seats so cramped on planes? Is it because airlines are greedy? Sure. But while they might be greedy, I don’t think they’re dumb. If you do a little math, you can calculate that if airlines were to remove a single row of seats, they could add perhaps 2.5 cm (1 in) of extra legroom for everyone, while only decreasing the number of paying customers by around 3%. (This is based on a 737 with single-class, but you get the idea.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why don’t airlines rip out a row of seats, raise prices by 3% and enjoy the reduced costs for fuel and customer service? The only answer I can see is that people, on average, aren’t actually willing to pay 3% more for 2.5 cm more legroom. We want a worse but cheaper product, and so that’s what we get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is the most common reason stuff is “bad”. It’s why Subway sandwiches are so soggy, why video games are so buggy, and why IKEA furniture and Primark clothes fall apart so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s good when things are bad for this reason. Or at least, that’s the premise of capitalism: When companies cut costs, that’s the invisible hand redirecting resources to maximize social value, or whatever. Companies may be motivated by greed. And you may not like it, since you want to pay zero dollars for infinite value. But this is markets working as designed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second reason stuff is bad: Information asymmetries&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is it that almost every book / blog / podcast about longevity is such garbage? Well, we don’t actually know many things that will reliably increase longevity. And those things are mostly all boring / hard / non-fun. And even if you do all of them, it probably only adds a couple of years in expectation. And telling people these facts is not a good way to find suckers who will pay you lots of money for your unproven supplements / seminars / etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;True! But it doesn’t explain why all longevity stuff is so bad. Why don’t honest people tell the true story and drive all the hucksters out of business? I suspect the answer is that unless you have a lot of scientific training and do a lot of research, it’s basically impossible to figure out just how huckstery all the hucksters really are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this same basic phenomenon explains why some supplements contain heavy metals, why some food contains microplastics, why restaurants use so much butter and salt, why rentals often have crappy insulation, and why most cars seem to only be safe along dimensions included in crash test scores. When consumers can’t tell good from evil, evil triumphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third reason stuff is bad: People have bad taste&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes stuff is bad because people just don’t appreciate the stuff you consider good. Examples are definitionally controversial, but I think this includes restaurants in cities where all restaurants are bad, North American tea, and travel pants. This reason has a blurry boundary with information asymmetries, as seen in ultrasonic humidifiers or products that use Sucralose instead of aspartame for “safety”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth reason stuff is bad: Pricing power&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, sometimes stuff is bad because markets aren’t working. Sometimes a company is selling a product but has some kind of “moat” that makes it hard for anyone else to compete with them, e.g. because of some technological or regulatory barrier, control of some key resource or location, intellectual property, a beloved brand, or network effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that’s true, then those companies don’t have to worry as much about someone else stealing their business, and so (because everyone is axiomatically greedy) they will find ways to make their product cheaper and/or raise prices up until the price is equal to the full value it provides to the marginal consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is food so expensive at sporting events? Yes, people have no alternatives. But people know food is expensive at sporting events. And they don’t like it. Instead of selling water for $17, why don’t venues sell water for $2 and raise ticket prices instead? I don’t know. Probably something complicated, like that expensive food allows you to extract extra money from rich people without losing business from non-rich people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So of course dating apps would love to string people along for years instead of finding them long-term relationships, so they keep paying money each month. I wouldn’t be surprised if some people at those companies have literally thought, “Maybe we should string people along for years instead of finding them long-term relationships, so they keep paying money each month, I love money so much.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if they are actually doing that (which is unclear to me) or if they are bad in some other way, then how do they get away with it? Why doesn’t someone else create a competing app that’s better and thereby steal all their business? It seems like the answer has to be either “because that’s impossible” or “because people don’t really want that”. That’s where the mystery begins.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Solving Fizz Buzz with Cosines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fizz Buzz is a counting game that has become oddly popular in the world of computer programming as a simple test of basic programming skills. The rules of the game are straightforward. Players say the numbers aloud in order beginning with one. Whenever a number is divisible by 3, they say 'Fizz' instead. If it is divisible by 5, they say 'Buzz'. If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, the player says both 'Fizz' and 'Buzz'. Here is a typical Python program that prints this sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for n in range(1, 101):
    if n % 15 == 0:
        print('FizzBuzz')
    elif n % 3 == 0:
        print('Fizz')
    elif n % 5 == 0:
        print('Buzz')
    else:
        print(n)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the output: fizz-buzz.txt. Can we make the program more complicated? The words 'Fizz', 'Buzz' and 'FizzBuzz' repeat in a periodic manner throughout the sequence. What else is periodic? Trigonometric functions! Perhaps we can use trigonometric functions to encode all four rules of the sequence in a single closed-form expression. That is what we are going to explore in this article. By the end, we will obtain a discrete Fourier series that can take any integer \( n \) and select the corresponding text to be printed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Definitions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before going any further, we establish a precise mathematical definition for the Fizz Buzz sequence. We begin by introducing a few functions that will help us define the Fizz Buzz sequence later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Symbol Functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We define a set of four functions \( \{ s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3 \} \) for integers \( n \) by: \begin{align*} s_0(n) &amp;amp;= n, \\ s_1(n) &amp;amp;= \mathtt{Fizz}, \\ s_2(n) &amp;amp;= \mathtt{Buzz}, \\ s_3(n) &amp;amp;= \mathtt{FizzBuzz}. \end{align*} We call these the symbol functions because they produce every term that appears in the Fizz Buzz sequence. The symbol function \( s_0 \) returns \( n \) itself. The functions \( s_1, \) \( s_2 \) and \( s_3 \) are constant functions that always return the literal words \( \mathtt{Fizz}, \) \( \mathtt{Buzz} \) and \( \mathtt{FizzBuzz} \) respectively, no matter what the value of \( n \) is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fizz Buzz Sequence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can define the Fizz Buzz sequence as the sequence \[ (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\infty} \] where \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;amp; \text{if } 3 \mid n \text{ and } 5 \nmid n, \\ 2 &amp;amp; \text{if } 3 \nmid n \text{ and } 5 \mid n, \\ 3 &amp;amp; \text{if } 3 \mid n \text{ and } 5 \mid n, \\ 0 &amp;amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} \] The notation \( m \mid n \) means that the integer \( m \) divides the integer \( n, \) i.e. \( n \) is a multiple of \( m. \) Equivalently, there exists an integer \( c \) such that \( n = cm . \) Similarly, \( m \nmid n \) means that \( m \) does not divide \( n, \) i.e. \( n \) is not a multiple of \( m. \) With the above definitions in place, we can expand the first few terms of the sequence explicitly as follows: \begin{align*} (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\infty} &amp;amp;= (s_{f(1)}(1), \; s_{f(2)}(2), \; s_{f(3)}(3), \; s_{f(4)}(4), \; s_{f(5)}(5), \; s_{f(6)}(6), \; s_{f(7)}(7), \; \dots) \\ &amp;amp;= (s_0(1), \; s_0(2), \; s_1(3), \; s_0(4), s_2(5), \; s_1(6), \; s_0(7), \; \dots) \\ &amp;amp;= (1, \; 2, \; \mathtt{Fizz}, \; 4, \; \mathtt{Buzz}, \; \mathtt{Fizz}, \; 7, \; \dots). \end{align*} Note how the function \( f(n) \) produces an index \( i \) which we then use to select the symbol function \( s_i(n) \) to produce the \( n \)th term of the sequence. We therefore call \( f(n) \) the index function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Indicator Functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the index function \( f(n) \) from the previous section with its cases and conditions rearranged to make it easier to spot interesting patterns: \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp;amp; \text{if } 5 \nmid n \text{ and } 3 \nmid n, \\ 1 &amp;amp; \text{if } 5 \nmid n \text{ and } 3 \mid n, \\ 2 &amp;amp; \text{if } 5 \mid n \text{ and } 3 \nmid n, \\ 3 &amp;amp; \text{if } 5 \mid n \text{ and } 3 \mid n. \end{cases} \] This function helps us to select another function \( s_{f(n)}(n) \) which in turn determines the \( n \)th term of the Fizz Buzz sequence. Our goal now is to replace this piecewise formula with a single closed-form expression. To do so, we first define indicator functions \( I_m(n) \) as follows: \[ I_m(n) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;amp; \text{if } m \mid n, \\ 0 &amp;amp; \text{if } m \nmid n. \end{cases} \] The formula for \( f(n) \) can now be written as: \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp;amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 0 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 0, \\ 1 &amp;amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 0 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 1, \\ 2 &amp;amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 1 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 0, \\ 3 &amp;amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 1 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 1. \end{cases} \] Do you see a pattern? Here is the same function written as a table:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;\( I_5(n) \)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;\( I_3(n) \)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;\( f(n) \)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 0 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 0 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 0 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 0 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 1 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 1 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 1 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 0 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 2 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 1 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 1 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\( 3 \)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you see it now? If we treat the values in the first two columns as binary digits and the values in the third column as decimal numbers, then in each row the first two columns give the binary representation of the number in the third column. For example, \( 3_{10} = 11_2 \) and indeed in the last row of the table, we see the bits \( 1 \) and \( 1 \) in the first two columns and the number \( 3 \) in the last column. In other words, writing the binary digits \( I_5(n) \) and \( I_3(n) \) side by side gives us the binary representation of \( f(n). \) Therefore \[ f(n) = 2 \, I_5(n) + I_3(n). \] We can now write a small program to demonstrate this formula:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
 for n in range(1, 101):
    s = [n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz']
    i = (n % 3 == 0) + 2 * (n % 5 == 0)
    print(s[i])
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can make it even shorter at the cost of some clarity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
 for n in range(1, 101):
    print([n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz'][(n % 3 == 0) + 2 * (n % 5 == 0)])
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we have obtained so far is pretty good. While there is no universal definition of a closed-form expression, I think most people would agree that the indicator functions as defined above are simple enough to be permitted in a closed-form expression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Complex Exponentials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the previous section, we obtained the formula \[ f(n) = I_3(n) + 2 \, I_5(n) \] which we then used as an index to look up the text to be printed. We also argued that this is a pretty good closed-form expression already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, in the interest of making things more complicated, we must ask ourselves: What if we are not allowed to use the indicator functions? What if we must adhere to the commonly accepted meaning of a closed-form expression which allows only finite combinations of basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integer exponents and roots with integer index as well as functions such as exponentials, logarithms and trigonometric functions. It turns out that the above formula can be rewritten using only addition, multiplication, division and the cosine function. Let us begin the translation. Consider the sum \[ S_m(n) = \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{2 \pi i k n / m}, \] where \( i \) is the imaginary unit and \( n \) and \( m \) are integers. This is a geometric series in the complex plane with ratio \( r = e^{2 \pi i n / m}. \) If \( n \) is a multiple of \( m , \) then \( n = cm \) for some integer \( c \) and we get \[ r = e^{2 \pi i n / m} = e^{2 \pi i c} = 1. \] Therefore, when \( n \) is a multiple of \( m, \) we get \[ S_m(n) = \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{2 \pi i k n / m} = \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} 1^k = m. \] If \( n \) is not a multiple of \( m, \) then \( r \ne 1 \) and the geometric series becomes \[ S_m(n) = \frac{r^m - 1}{r - 1} = \frac{e^{2 \pi i n} - 1}{e^{2 \pi i n / m} - 1} = 0. \] Therefore, \[ S_m(n) = \begin{cases} m &amp;amp; \text{if } m \mid n, \\ 0 &amp;amp; \text{if } m \nmid n. \end{cases} \] Dividing both sides by \( m, \) we get \[ \frac{S_m(n)}{m} = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;amp; \text{if } m \mid n, \\ 0 &amp;amp; \text{if } m \nmid n. \end{cases} \] But the right-hand side is \( I_m(n). \) Therefore \[ I_m(n) = \frac{S_m(n)}{m} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{2 \pi i k n / m}. \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cosines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We begin with Euler's formula \[ e^{i x} = \cos x + i \sin x \] where \( x \) is a real number. From this formula, we get \[ e^{i x} + e^{-i x} = 2 \cos x. \] Therefore \begin{align*} I_3(n) &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{3} \sum_{k = 0}^2 e^{2 \pi i k n / 3} \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{3} \left( 1 + e^{2 \pi i n / 3} + e^{4 \pi i n / 3} \right) \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{3} \left( 1 + e^{2 \pi i n / 3} + e^{-2 \pi i n / 3} \right) \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right). \end{align*} The third equality above follows from the fact that \( e^{4 \pi i n / 3} = e^{6 \pi i n / 3} e^{-2 \pi i n / 3} = e^{2 \pi i n} e^{-2 \pi i n/3} = e^{-2 \pi i n / 3}. \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function above is defined for integer values of \( n \) but we can extend its formula to real \( x \) and plot it to observe its shape between integers. As expected, the function takes the value \( 1 \) whenever \( x \) is an integer multiple of \( 3 \) and \( 0 \) whenever \( x \) is an integer not divisible by \( 3. \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, \begin{align*} I_5(n) &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{5} \sum_{k = 0}^4 e^{2 \pi i k n / 5} \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{5} \left( 1 + e^{2 \pi i n / 5} + e^{4 \pi i n / 5} + e^{6 \pi i n / 5} + e^{8 \pi i n / 5} \right) \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{5} \left( 1 + e^{2 \pi i n / 5} + e^{4 \pi i n / 5} + e^{-4 \pi i n / 5} + e^{-2 \pi i n / 5} \right) \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right) + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right). \end{align*} Extending this expression to real values of \( x \) allows us to plot its shape as well. Once again, the function takes the value \( 1 \) at integer multiples of \( 5 \) and \( 0 \) at integers not divisible by \( 5. \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recall that we expressed \( f(n) \) as \[ f(n) = I_3(n) + 2 \, I_5(n). \] Substituting these trigonometric expressions yields \[ f(n) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right) + 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right) + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right) \right). \] A straightforward simplification gives \[ f(n) = \frac{11}{15} + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right) + \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right) + \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right). \] We can extend this expression to real \( x \) and plot it as well. The resulting curve takes the values \( 0, 1, 2 \) and \( 3 \) at integer points, as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can write our Python program as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
 from math import cos, pi
for n in range(1, 101):
    s = [n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz']
    i = round(11 / 15 + (2 / 3) * cos(2 * pi * n / 3)
                      + (4 / 5) * cos(2 * pi * n / 5)
                      + (4 / 5) * cos(4 * pi * n / 5))
    print(s[i])
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discrete Fourier Transform&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The keen-eyed might notice that the expression we obtained for \( f(n) \) is a finite Fourier series. This is not surprising, since the output of a Fizz Buzz programme depends only on \( n \bmod 15 . \) Any function on a finite cyclic group can be written exactly as a finite Fourier expansion. In this section, we recover the same function \( f(n) \) using the discrete Fourier transform. It is worth mentioning here that the calculations presented here are quite tedious to do by hand. Nevertheless, this section offers a glimpse of how such coefficients are calculated. By the end, we will arrive at exactly the same \( f(n) \) as before. There is nothing new to discover here. We simply obtain the result by a different, more direct and noticeably tedious method. If this doesn't sound interesting to you, you may safely skip this section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that \( f(n) \) is a periodic function with period \( 15. \) To apply the discrete Fourier transform, we look at one complete period using the indices \( n = 1, 2, \dots, 15. \) Over this period, the values are: \begin{array}{c|ccccccccccccccc} n &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 6 &amp;amp; 7 &amp;amp; 8 &amp;amp; 9 &amp;amp; 10 &amp;amp; 11 &amp;amp; 12 &amp;amp; 13 &amp;amp; 14 &amp;amp; 15 \\ \hline f(n) &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 3 \end{array} The discrete Fourier transform gives us the constants defined by: \[ c_k = \frac{1}{15} \sum_{n = 1}^{15} f(n) e^{-2 \pi i k n / 15}, \] for \( k = 1, 2, \dots, 15. \) These constants reconstruct \( f(n) \) via the inverse transform: \[ f(n) = \sum_{k = 1}^{15} c_k e^{2 \pi i k n / 15} \] where \( n \in \mathbb{Z}. \) Let us compute the first constant: \[ c_1 = \frac{1}{15}\left( \begin{aligned} e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 3/15} &amp;amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 5/15} + e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 6/15} + e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 9/15} \\ &amp;amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 10/15} + e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 12/15} + 3 e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 15/15} \end{aligned} \right) = 0. \] Similarly, \[ c_2 = \frac{1}{15}\left( \begin{aligned} e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 6/15} &amp;amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 10/15} + e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 12/15} + e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 18/15} \\ &amp;amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 20/15} + e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 24/15} + 3 e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 30/15} \end{aligned} \right) = 0. \] and \[ c_3 = \frac{1}{15}\left( \begin{aligned} e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 9/15} &amp;amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 15/15} + e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 18/15} + e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 27/15} \\ &amp;amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 30/15} + e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 36/15} + 3 e^{-2 \pi i \cdot 45/15} \end{aligned} \right) = \frac{2}{5}. \] Continuing in this manner, we find all the constants: \begin{align*} c_1 &amp;amp;= c_2 = c_4 = c_7 = c_8 = c_{11} = c_{13} = c_{14} = 0, \\ c_3 &amp;amp;= c_6 = c_9 = c_{12} = \frac{2}{5}, \\ c_5 &amp;amp;= c_{10} = \frac{1}{3}, \\ c_{15} &amp;amp;= \frac{11}{15}. \end{align*} Using the inverse transform, we get \begin{align*} f(n) &amp;amp;= \sum_{k = 1}^{15} c_k \, e^{2 \pi i k n / 15} \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{11}{15} + \frac{2}{5} \left( e^{2 \pi i \cdot 3n/15} + e^{2 \pi i \cdot 6n/15} + e^{2 \pi i \cdot 9n/15} + e^{2 \pi i \cdot 12n/15} \right) \\ &amp;amp;\phantom{=} \phantom{\frac{11}{15}} + \frac{1}{3} \left( e^{2 \pi i \cdot 5n/15} + e^{2 \pi i \cdot 10n/15} \right) \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{11}{15} + \frac{2}{5} \left( e^{6 \pi i n/15} + e^{12 \pi i n/15} + e^{18 \pi i n/15} + e^{24 \pi i n/15} \right) \\ &amp;amp;\phantom{=} \phantom{\frac{11}{15}} + \frac{1}{3} \left( e^{10 \pi i n/15} + e^{20 \pi i n/15} \right) \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{11}{15} + \frac{2}{5} \left( e^{6 \pi i n/15} + e^{12 \pi i n/15} + e^{-12 \pi i n/15} + e^{-6 \pi i n/15} \right) \\ &amp;amp;\phantom{=} \phantom{\frac{11}{15}} + \frac{1}{3} \left( e^{10 \pi i n/15} + e^{-10 \pi i n/15} \right) \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{11}{15} + \frac{2}{5} \left( 2 \cos \left( \frac{6 \pi n}{15} \right) + 2 \cos \left( \frac{12 \pi n}{15} \right) \right) \\ &amp;amp;\phantom{=} \phantom{\frac{11}{15}} + \frac{1}{3} \left( 2 \cos \left( \frac{10 \pi n}{15} \right) \right) \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{11}{15} + \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right) + \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right) + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right). \end{align*} This gives us exactly the same function \( f(n) \) we obtained earlier. The difference is only in how we arrived there. Working out Fourier coefficients by hand is slow and mechanical. In practice these sums are almost always computed automatically by numerical software or computer algebra systems. Still, this exercise shows that our humble Fizz Buzz index function can be expressed precisely using the machinery of Fourier analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To summarise, we have defined the Fizz Buzz sequence as \[ (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\infty} \] where \[ f(n) = \frac{11}{15} + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right) + \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right) + \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right). \] and \( s_0(n) = n, \) \( s_1(n) = \mathtt{Fizz}, \) \( s_2(n) = \mathtt{Buzz} \) and \( s_3(n) = \mathtt{FizzBuzz}. \) A Python program to print the Fizz Buzz sequence based on this definition was presented earlier. That program can be written more succinctly as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
 from math import cos, pi
for n in range(1, 101):
    print([n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz'][round(11 / 15 + (2 / 3) * cos(2 * pi * n / 3) + (4 / 5) * (cos(2 * pi * n / 5) + cos(4 * pi * n / 5)))])
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can also wrap this up nicely in a shell one-liner, in case you want to share it with your friends and family and surprise them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;python3 -c 'from math import cos, pi; [print([n, "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz"][round(11/15 + (2/3) * cos(2*pi*n/3) + (4/5) * (cos(2*pi*n/5) + cos(4*pi*n/5)))]) for n in range(1, 101)]'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have taken a simple counting game and turned it into a trigonometric construction: a finite Fourier series with a constant term \( 11/15 \) and three cosine terms with coefficients \( 2/3, \) \( 4/5 \) and \( 4/5. \) None of this makes Fizz Buzz any easier, of course, but it does show that every \( \mathtt{Fizz} \) and \( \mathtt{Buzz} \) now owes its existence to a particular set of Fourier coefficients. We began with the modest goal of making this simple problem more complicated. I think it is safe to say that we did not fall short.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Helping Valve to Power Up Steam Devices&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, Valve stunned the computer gaming world by unveiling three new gaming devices at once: the Steam Frame, a wireless VR headset; the Steam Machine, a gaming console in the vein of a PlayStation or Xbox; and the Steam Controller, a handheld game controller. Successors to the highly successful Valve Index and Steam Deck, these devices are set to be released in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Igalia has long worked with Valve on SteamOS, which will power the Machine and Frame, and is excited to be contributing to these new devices, particularly the Frame. The Frame, unlike the Machine or Deck which have x86 CPUs, runs on an ARM-based CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, this would mean that only games compiled to run on ARM chips could be played on the Frame. In order to get around this barrier, a translation layer called FEX is used to run applications compiled for x86 chips (which are used in nearly all gaming PCs) on ARM chips by translating the x86 machine code into ARM64 machine code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âIf you love video games, like I do, working on FEX with Valve is a dream come true,â said Paulo Matos, an engineer with Igaliaâs Compilers Team. Even so, the challenges can be daunting, because making sure the translation is working often requires manual QA rather than automated testing. âYou have to start a game, sometimes the error shows up in the colors or sound, or how the game behaves when you break down the door in the second level. Just debugging this can take a while,â said Matos. âFor optimization work I did early last year, I used a game called Psychonauts to test it. I must have played the first 3 to 4 minutes of the game many, many times for debugging. Looking at my history, Steam tells me I played it for 29 hours, but it was always the first few minutes, nothing else.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the CPU, the Qualcomm Adreno 750 GPU used in the Steam Frame introduced its own set of challenges when it came to running desktop games, and other complex workloads, on these devices. Doing so requires a rock-solid Vulkan driver that can ensure correctness, eliminating major rendering bugs, while maintaining high performance. This is a very difficult combination to achieve, and yet thatâs exactly what weâve done for Valve with Mesa3D Turnip, a FOSS Vulkan driver for Qualcomm Adreno GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we started our work, critical optimizations such as LRZ (which you can learn more about from our blog post here) or the autotuner (and its subsequent overhaul) werenât in place. Even worse, there wasnât support for the Adreno 700-series GPUs at all, which we eventually added along with support for tiled rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âWe implemented many Vulkan extensions and reviewed numerous others,â said Danylo Piliaiev, an engineer on the Graphics Team. âOver the years, we ensured that D3D11, D3D12, and OpenGL games rendered correctly through DXVK, vkd3d-proton, and Zink, investigating many rendering issues along the way. We achieved higher correctness than the proprietary driver and, in many cases, Mesa3D Turnip is faster as well.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâve worked with many wonderful people from Valve, Google, and other companies to iterate on the Vulkan driver over the years in order to introduce new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, as well as debugging workflows. Some of those people decided to join Igalia later on, such as our colleague and Graphics Team developer Emma Anholt. âIâve been working on Mesa for 22 years, and itâs great to have a home now where I can keep doing that work, across hardware projects, where the organization prioritizes the work experience of its developers and empowers them within the organization.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valveâs support in all this cannot be understated, either. Their choice to build their devices using open software like Mesa3D Turnip and FEX means theyâre committed to working on and supporting improvements and optimizations that become available to anyone who uses the same open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âWeâve received a lot of positive feedback about significantly improved performance and fewer rendering glitches from hobbyists who use these projects to run PC games on Android phones as a result of our work,â said Dhruv Mark Collins, another Graphics Team engineer working on Turnip. âAnd it goes both ways! Weâve caught a couple of nasty bugs because of that widespread testing, which really emphasizes why the FOSS model is beneficial for everyone involved.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interesting area of graphics driver development is all the compiler work that is involved. Vulkan drivers such as Mesa3D Turnip need to process shader programs sent by the application to the GPU, and these programs govern how pixels in our screens are shaded or colored with geometry, textures, and lights while playing games. Job Noorman, an engineer from our Compilers Team, made significant contributions to the compiler used by Mesa3D Turnip. He also contributed to the Mesa3D NIR shader compiler, a common part that all Mesa drivers use, including RADV (most popularly used on the Steam Deck) or V3DV (used on Raspberry Pi boards).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is normal for Igalia, while we focused on delivering results for our customer, we also made our work as widely useful as possible. For example: âWhile our target throughout our work has been the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 thatâs in the Frame, much of our work extends back through years of Snapdragon hardware, and we regression test it to make sure it stays Vulkan conformant,â said Anholt. This means that Igaliaâs work for the Frame has consistently passed Vulkanâs Conformance Test Suite (CTS) of over 2.8 million tests, some of which Igalia is involved in creating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our very own Vulkan CTS expert Ricardo GarcÃa says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Igalia and other Valve contractors actively participate in several areas inside the Khronos Group, the organization maintaining and developing graphics API standards like Vulkan. We contribute specification fixes and feedback, and we are regularly involved in the development of many new Vulkan extensions. Some of these end up being critical for game developers, like mesh shading. Others ensure a smooth and efficient translation of other APIs like DirectX to Vulkan, or help take advantage of hardware features to ensure applications perform great across multiple platforms, both mobile like the Steam Frame or desktop like the Steam Machine. Having Vulkan CTS coverage for these new extensions is a critical step in the release process, helping make sure the specification is clear and drivers implement it correctly, and Igalia engineers have contributed millions of source code lines and tests since our collaboration with Valve started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A huge challenge we faced in moving forward with development is ensuring that we didnât introduce regressions, small innocent-seeming changes can completely break rendering on games in a way that even CTS might not catch. What automated testing could be done was often quite constrained, but Igalians found ways to push through the barriers. âI made a continuous integration test to automatically run single-frame captures of a wide range of games spanning D3D11, D3D9, D3D8, Vulkan, and OpenGL APIs,â said Piliaiev, about the development covered in his recent XDC 2025 talk, âensuring that we donât have rendering or performance regressions.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Igaliaâs work for Valve will continue to deliver benefits to the wider Linux Gaming ecosystem. For example, the Steam Frame, as a battery-powered VR headset, needs to deliver high performance within a limited power budget. A way to address this is to create a more efficient task scheduler, which is something Changwoo Min of Igaliaâs Kernel Team has been working on. As he says, âI have been developing a customized CPU scheduler for gaming, named LAVD: Latency-criticality Aware Virtual Deadline scheduler.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general terms, a scheduler automatically identifies critical tasks and dynamically boosts their deadlines to improve responsiveness. Most task schedulers donât take energy consumption into account, but the Rust-based LAVD is different. âLAVD makes scheduling decisions considering each chipâs performance versus energy trade-offs. It measures and predicts the required computing power on the fly, then selects the best set of CPUs to meet that demand with minimal energy consumption,â said Min.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of our other kernel engineers, Melissa Wen, has been working on AMD kernel display drivers to maintain good color management and HDR support for SteamOS across AMD hardware families, both for the Steam Deck and the Steam Machine. This is especially important with newer display hardware in the Steam Machine, which features some notable differences in color capabilities, aiming for more powerful and efficient color management which necessitated driver work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¦and thatâs a wrap! We will continue our efforts toward improving future versions of SteamOS, and with a partner as strongly supportive as Valve, we expect to do more work to make Linux gaming even better. If any of that sounded interesting and youâd like to work with us to tackle tricky problems of your own, please get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Pixar: The Early Days&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A never-before-seen 1996 interview&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 18, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To mark Toy Story’s 30th anniversary, we’re sharing a never-before-seen interview with Steve from November 22, 1996—exactly one year after the film debuted in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Toy Story was the world’s first entirely computer-animated feature-length film. An instant hit with audiences and critics, it also transformed Pixar, which went public the week after its premiere. Buoyed by Toy Story’s success, Pixar’s stock price closed at nearly double its initial offering, giving it a market valuation of approximately $1.5 billion and marking the largest IPO of 1995. The following year, Toy Story was nominated for three Academy Awards en route to winning a Special Achievement Oscar in March. In July, Pixar announced that it would close its television-commercial unit to focus primarily on feature films. By the time of the interview, the team had grown by 70 percent in less than a year; A Bug’s Life was in production; and behind the scenes, Steve was using his new leverage to renegotiate Pixar’s partnership with Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this footage, Steve reveals the long game behind Pixar’s seeming overnight success. With striking clarity, he explains how its business model gives artists and engineers a stake in their creations, and he reflects on what Disney’s hard-won wisdom taught him about focus and discipline. He also talks about the challenge of leading a team so talented that it inverts the usual hierarchy, the incentives that inspire people to stay with the company, and the deeper purpose that unites them all: to tell stories that last and put something of enduring value into the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Pixar, Steve collaborated closely with president Ed Catmull and refined a management approach centered on creating the conditions for talent to thrive. When he returned to Apple a few weeks after this interview, his experience at Pixar shaped how he saw his role as CEO: building a company on timeless ideas made new through technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Celebrating Steve’s timeless address&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Arduino Terms of Service and Privacy Policy update: setting the record straight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve heard some questions and concerns following our recent Terms of Service and Privacy Policy updates. We are thankful our community cares enough to engage with us and we believe transparency and open dialogue are foundational to Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us be absolutely clear: we have been open-source long before it was fashionable. We’re not going to change now. The Qualcomm acquisition doesn’t modify how user data is handled or how we apply our open-source principles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We periodically update our legal documents to reflect new features, evolving regulations, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What remains the same&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open Source and reverse-engineering. Any hardware, software or services (e.g. Arduino IDE, hardware schematics, tooling and libraries) released with Open Source licenses remain available as before. Restrictions on reverse-engineering apply specifically to our Software-as-a-Service cloud applications. Anything that was open, stays open.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ownership of your creations. The Terms of Service clarifies that the content you choose to publish on the Arduino platform remains yours, and can be used to enable features you’ve requested, such as cloud services and collaboration tools.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minors’ data and privacy. Our privacy disclosures have been strengthened, including enhanced protections for minors’ data. We’ve updated our data retention policies and age limits to provide age-appropriate services. We limit data retention for inactive users by automatically deactivating their accounts after 24 months of inactivity, in which case usernames would still be preserved in the Arduino Forum to address an explicit request from the Forum community to maintain attribution for user-generated content; where user requests account deletion, the username would be promptly removed and related posts would become anonymous.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why we updated our terms: clarity and compliance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These latest changes are about clarity, compliance, and supporting the innovative environment you expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what the updates actually cover:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enhanced transparency around data practices: We’ve made our privacy disclosures more precise and more detailed, including what data we retain, to protect your privacy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New product capabilities and AI: As we introduce optional AI-powered features, such as those in the Arduino UNO Q and Arduino App Lab, we needed to update our terms to reflect these new capabilities and encourage their safe, responsible, and ethical use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More precise commercial terms: For users of our Premium Services, we’ve clarified billing mechanics, recurring payments, and refund rights to make purchasing and returns easier.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Legal compliance: We’ve updated language to address US-specific privacy laws, export controls, and other regulatory requirements, while ensuring compliance with global standards.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our 20-year commitment to open-source is unwavering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are very proud of the Arduino community, and we would like to reaffirm our fundamental, non-negotiable commitment to the principles that founded Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please read the full Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, to appreciate how they support the innovative, collaborative environment you’ve come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have specific questions or concerns, please consult our detailed Q&amp;amp;A in our FAQ section or reach out to us at privacy@arduino.cc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are Arduino. We are open. We’re not going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was minding my own business, peacefully reading a well-written and informative article about artificial intelligence, when I was ambushed by a passage in the article that aroused my pique. That’s one of the pitfalls of knowing too much about a topic a journalist is discussing; journalists often make mistakes that most readers wouldn’t notice but that raise the hackles or at least the blood pressure of those in the know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The article in question appeared in The New Yorker. The author, Stephen Witt, was writing about the way that your typical Large Language Model, starting from a blank slate, or rather a slate full of random scribbles, is able to learn about the world, or rather the virtual world called the internet. Throughout the training process, billions of numbers called weights get repeatedly updated so as to steadily improve the model’s performance. Picture a tiny chip with electrons racing around in etched channels, and slowly zoom out: there are many such chips in each server node and many such nodes in each rack, with racks organized in rows, many rows per hall, many halls per building, many buildings per campus. It’s a sort of computer-age version of Borges’ Library of Babel. And the weight-update process that all these countless circuits are carrying out depends heavily on an operation known as matrix multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Witt explained this clearly and accurately, right up to the point where his essay took a very odd turn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAMMERING NAILS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what Witt went on to say about matrix multiplication:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“‘Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics,’ the mathematician G. H. Hardy wrote, in 1940. But matrix multiplication, to which our civilization is now devoting so many of its marginal resources, has all the elegance of a man hammering a nail into a board. It is possessed of neither beauty nor symmetry: in fact, in matrix multiplication, a times b is not the same as b times a.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last sentence struck me as a bizarre non sequitur, somewhat akin to saying “Number addition has neither beauty nor symmetry, because when you write two numbers backwards, their new sum isn’t just their original sum written backwards; for instance, 17 plus 34 is 51, but 71 plus 43 isn’t 15.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next day I sent the following letter to the magazine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I appreciate Stephen Witt shining a spotlight on matrices, which deserve more attention today than ever before: they play important roles in ecology, economics, physics, and now artificial intelligence (“Information Overload”, November 3). But Witt errs in bringing Hardy’s famous quote (“there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics”) into his story. Matrix algebra is the language of symmetry and transformation, and the fact that a followed by b differs from b followed by a is no surprise; to expect the two transformations to coincide is to seek symmetry in the wrong place — like judging a dog’s beauty by whether its tail resembles its head. With its two-thousand-year-old roots in China, matrix algebra has secured a permanent place in mathematics, and it passes the beauty test with flying colors. In fact, matrices are commonplace in number theory, the branch of pure mathematics Hardy loved most.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confining my reply to 150 words required some finesse. Notice for instance that the opening sentence does double duty: it leavens my many words of negative criticism with a few words of praise, and it stresses the importance of the topic, preëmptively1 rebutting editors who might be inclined to dismiss my correction as too arcane to merit publication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven’t heard back from the editors, and I don’t expect to. Regardless, Witt’s misunderstanding deserves a more thorough response than 150 words can provide. Let’s see what I can do with 1500 words and a few pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE GEOMETRY OF TRANSFORMATIONS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a static object, matrices are “just” rectangular arrays of numbers, but that doesn’t capture what they’re really about. If I had to express the essence of matrices in a single word, that word would be “transformation”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One example of a transformation is the operation f that takes an image in the plane and flips it from left to right, as if in a vertical mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Another example is the operation g that that takes an image in the plane and reflects it across a diagonal line that goes from lower left to upper right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The key thing to notice here is that the effect of f followed by g is different from the effect of g followed by f. To see why, write a capital R on one side of a square piece of paper–preferably using a dark marker and/or translucent paper, so that you can still see the R even when the paper has been flipped over–and apply f followed by g; you’ll get the original R rotated by 90 degrees clockwise. But if instead, starting from that original R, you were to apply g followed by f, you’d get the original R rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same two operations, different outcomes! Symbolically we write g ◦ f ≠ f ◦ g, where g ◦ f means “First do f, then do g” and f ◦ g means “First do g, then f”.2 The symbol ◦ denotes the meta-operation (operation-on-operations) called composition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the order in which transformations are applied can affect the outcome shouldn’t surprise you. After all, when you’re composing a salad, if you forget to pour on salad dressing until after you’ve topped the base salad with grated cheese, your guests will have a different dining experience than if you’d remembered to pour on the dressing first. Likewise, when you’re composing a melody, a C-sharp followed by a D is different from a D followed by a C-sharp. And as long as mathematicians used the word “composition” rather than “multiplication”, nobody found it paradoxical that in many contexts, order matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE ALGEBRA OF MATRICES&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we use the usual x, y coordinates in the plane, the geometric operation f can be understood as the numerical operation that sends the pair (x, y) to the pair (−x, y), which we can represented via the 2-by-2 array&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where more generally the array&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;stands for the transformation that sends the pair (x, y) to the pair (ax+by, cx+dy). This kind of array is called a matrix, and when we want to compose two operations like f and g together, all we have to do is combine the associated matrices under the rule that says that the matrix&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;composed with the matrix&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;equals the matrix&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more about where this formula comes from, see my Mathematical Enchantments essay “What Is A Matrix?”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing special about 2-by-2 matrices; you could compose two 3-by-3 matrices, or even two 1000-by-1000 matrices. Going in the other direction (smaller instead of bigger), if you look at 1-by-1 matrices, the composition of&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is just&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;so ordinary number-multiplication arises as a special case of matrix composition; turning this around, we can see matrix-composition as a sort of generalized multiplication. So it was natural for mid-19th-century mathematicians to start using words like “multiply” and “product” instead of words like “compose” and “composition”, at roughly the same time they stopped talking about “substitutions” and “tableaux” and started to use the word “matrices”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In importing the centuries-old symbolism for number multiplication into the new science of linear algebra, the 19th century algebraists were saying “Matrices behave kind of like numbers,” with the proviso “except when they don’t”. Witt is right when he says that when A and B are matrices, A times B is not always equal to B times A. Where he’s wrong is in asserting that is a blemish on linear algebra. Many mathematicians regard linear algebra as one of the most elegant sub-disciplines of mathematics ever devised, and it often serves as a role model for the kind of sleekness that a new mathematical discipline should strive to achieve. If you dislike matrix multiplication because AB isn’t always equal to BA, it’s because you haven’t yet learned what matrix multiplication is good for in math, physics, and many other subjects. It’s ironic that Witt invokes the notion of symmetry to disparage matrix multiplication, since matrix theory and an allied discipline called group theory are the tools mathematicians use in fleshing out our intuitive ideas about symmetry that arise in art and science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how did an intelligent person like Witt go so far astray?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PROOFS VS CALCULATIONS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m guessing that part of Witt’s confusion arises from the fact that actually multiplying matrices of numbers to get a matrix of bigger numbers can be very tedious, and tedium is psychologically adjacent to distaste and a perception of ugliness. But the tedium of matrix multiplication is tied up with its symmetry (whose existence Witt mistakenly denies). When you multiply two n-by-n matrices A and B in the straightforward way, you have to compute n2 numbers in the same unvarying fashion, and each of those n2 numbers is the sum of n terms, and each of those n terms is the product of an element of A and an element of B in a simple way. It’s only human to get bored and inattentive and then make mistakes because the process is so repetitive. We tend to think of symmetry and beauty as synonyms, but sometimes excessive symmetry breeds ennui; repetition in excess can be repellent. Picture the Library of Babel and the existential dread the image summons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G. H. Hardy, whose famous remark Witt quotes, was in the business of proving theorems, and he favored conceptual proofs over calculational ones. If you showed him a proof of a theorem in which the linchpin of your argument was a 5-page verification that a certain matrix product had a particular value, he’d say you didn’t really understand your own theorem; he’d assert that you should find a more conceptual argument and then consign your brute-force proof to the trash. But Hardy’s aversion to brute force was specific to the domain of mathematical proof, which is far removed from math that calculates optimal pricing for annuities or computes the wind-shear on an airplane wing or fine-tunes the weights used by an AI. Furthermore, Hardy’s objection to your proof would focus on the length of the calculation, and not on whether the calculation involved matrices. If you showed him a proof that used 5 turgid pages of pre-19th-century calculation that never mentioned matrices once, he’d still say “Your proof is a piece of temporary mathematics; it convinces the reader that your theorem is true without truly explaining why the theorem is true.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you forced me at gunpoint to multiply two 5-by-5 matrices together, I’d be extremely unhappy, and not just because you were threatening my life; the task would be inherently unpleasant. But the same would be true if you asked me to add together a hundred random two-digit numbers. It’s not that matrix-multiplication or number-addition is ugly; it’s that such repetitive tasks are the diametrical opposite of the kind of conceptual thinking that Hardy loved and I love too. Any kind of mathematical content can be made stultifying when it’s stripped of its meaning and reduced to mindless toil. But that casts no shade on the underlying concepts. When we outsource number-addition or matrix-multiplication to a computer, we rightfully delegate the soul-crushing part of our labor to circuitry that has no soul. If we could peer into the innards of the circuits doing all those matrix multiplications, we would indeed see a nightmarish, Borgesian landscape, with billions of nails being hammered into billions of boards, over and over again. But please don’t confuse that labor with mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;#2. I know this convention may seem backwards on first acquaintance, but this is how ◦ is defined. Blame the people who first started writing things like “log x” and “cos x“, with the x coming after the name of the operation. This led to the notation f(x) for the result of applying the function f to the number x. Then the symbol for the result of applying g to the result of applying f to x is g(f(x)); even though f is performed first, “f” appears to the right of “g“. From there, it became natural to write the function that sends x to g(f(x)) as “g ◦ f“.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Personal blogs are back, should niche blogs be next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;20 November 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to blogging there are few rules. Write content that is somehow meaningful might be one of them though. I think it’s down to the individual to determine what constitutes meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the hey-day, the so-called golden age of blogging, there were plenty of people prepared to offer definitions of meaningful, and how to write accordingly. It was natural. The web was once awash with all sorts of blogs. Likewise people who wanted to show others how to blog “successfully”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, the definition of successful resided with the individual, but it was obvious this involved monetary return for some people. And why not. If you’re going to invest time and energy in creating a resource that is useful to other people, why shouldn’t you earn money, make a living even, from it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of these people blogging about blogging was Melbourne based Australian writer and author Darren Rowse, who launched his blogging resource Problogger in 2004. Without going into detail, because you can look it up for yourself, Rowse, as one of the earlier bloggers about blogging, did, and still does presumably, rather well for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rowse’s writing, and that of his contributors, attracted numerous readers keen to learn what they could about blogging, and the potential to make money from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problogger is what’s called a niche blog. As a blog about blogging, it has a reasonably singular focus. Some people considered this niche principle to be a core tenet of blogging. There was this idea, in the earlier days of blogging, which possibly still persists, that blogs would do better if they had a speciality. Not only were search engines said to be in favour the approach, but the author of a speciality, or niche blog, would generally be considered to be an expert, of some sort, in their field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A master of one trade, rather than the proverbial jack of all trades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless, the world was once full of blogs on every topic imaginable. It was a great time to be alive. If you wanted to learn about something in particular, there was a blog for you. Some publications featured quality content, others required a little fact checking, while some were definitely to be taken with a pinch of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But niche blogging was never a format that suited everyone. There are people who did, still do, well, writing about a range, sometimes a wide range, of topics. Kottke is one of the better known blogs that does not have a specific speciality. Here, the publication itself is the speciality. To repeat what I wrote in the first sentence of this article: the rules of blogging are few.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the facets of blogging covered at Problogger, and numerous other similar websites, usually only applied to blogs of a commercial nature. That’s not to say one or two personal bloggers might have looked at the tips posted there for increasing their audience, or improving their writing though. But in my view, personal bloggers were not, are not, part of Problogger’s target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I last wrote about Problogger, let alone visited the website, maybe fifteen plus years, but a recent mention of it by Kev Quick, via ldstephens, caught my eye. But I don’t believe Rowse is being critical, in any way, of personal bloggers because they do not adhere to a niche or speciality publishing format. That’s not what Problogger, or Rowse, is about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this started me thinking, and writing another of my long posts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an age where social media, and influencers, have usurped blogs and their A-List authors, in the jostle for supremacy, it has to be wondered what role websites like Problogger still have. Only a handful of blogs generate liveable incomes today. Despite the doom and gloom though, the form has not completely died off. A backlash against social media, and a growing IndieWeb/SmallWeb community, has precipitated a revival in personal websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a largely non-commercial movement. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with personal websites. Many of us started out with them in the early days of the web. But the web was not only intended for personal journals. It was a vehicle for sharing all manner of information. The web could also empower individuals, and partnerships, to not only set up shop online, be that blogs, or quite literally shops, but potentially make a living at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But with the revival of personal blogs well underway, I think it’s time to bring niche blogs back into the fold. I’m talking about well written, quality, topic focused resources. This is material fast vanishing from the web, leaving ever diminishing options to source useful and accurate information. What are the alternatives? The misinformation morass that is social media? Being served AI generated summaries in response to search engine queries? A web choke full of AI slop?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I’m not advocating for a return of niche blogs plastered with adverts, and popup boxes urging visitors to subscribe to say a newsletter, before they’ve even had a chance to blink at what they came to read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m talking about work produced by independent writers, with an interest in their subject matter, who are not backed by large media organisations, or private equity. This is bringing back reliable sources of information, that also recompenses the content writers in some way. Hopefully we’ve learned a few lessons about monetisation since the earlier wave of niche blogging. We know it is possible to generate revenue without compromising the reader experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A resurgence in personal blogging is the first step in rebuilding a vibrant, thriving, web, of if you like, blogosphere. Now the focus needs to be on restoring the flow of accessible and trusted information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article targets an advanced audience who are already familiar with the 3D printing. In this article I will try to collect some information I haven’t found written down in a single place yet. In particular, a lot of the information is seemingly only available in the form of YouTube videos that take a long time to get to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are new to 3D printing and/or CAD for 3D printing, this is not the right article for you. Come back when you have done a bit of printing/design and want to learn advanced tricks to save on print time and material usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Basics of vase mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that out of the way what is this about? Vase mode is a printing mode where the printer prints a spiral path, with no seams. This is fast, avoids the visual blemishes of the seam but also has some downsides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only a single perimeter. This potentially means weaker parts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No disconnected areas (per layer), you have to print with a single path.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No internal geometry. No infill. No top layers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No supports.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically, it gets used for vases and pots. Thus, the name. Here is a crude example (I’m not an aesthetics focused designer, so imagine something prettier than this. If it fits and functions, it ships in my book):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of note here is that the model itself isn’t hollow, but the slicer will make it hollow for you (since it only prints a single perimeter). In PrusaSlicer this setting is found at “Print Settings” → “Layers and perimeters” → “Vertical shells” → “Spiral vase”. OrcaSlicer etc should have the same or similar setting as well somewhere else. I have no idea about Cura.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there are some ways to stretch this mode to the limits, and that is what this article is about. This will make vase mode useful for more than just simple vases. And that can often be the fastest and lightest way to print a part, if you can pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand the tricks you do need to understand how vase mode works though. It takes solid geometry, and takes the outline of it. What is inside doesn’t matter. It will be ignored:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As can be seen, while the hole exists in the bottom solid layers, the slicer ignores it above that point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what can we do above that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Internal geometry via slits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea comes from the RC plane 3D printing community, where they want to print lightweight but strong parts. In particular wings with internal supporting geometry.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two main tricks for unconventional vase mode prints. Let’s start with slits, as the next trick builds upon this first trick. As I’m no aircraft wing designer I will use other geometry for illustration purposes. The idea is useful in other contexts than RC wings, that is the whole point of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make a slit into the part. The left is for demonstration only, you need the slit to be really thin, 0.00011 mm or so, as shown on the right:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we extrude this into a block and slice it, PrusaSlicer will see this slit and print an outer perimeter going into the part, making a sort of internal support. You are basically modelling the infill yourself now:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you try this, it will not work for you. This is because you are missing a crucial setting in PrusaSlicer. By default, PrusaSlicer will merge together close parts of the model. You need to change “Printer Settings” → “Advanced” → “Slicing” → “Slice gap closing radius”. Set it to 0.0.3 Otherwise, none of this will work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our example with a hole in the middle from the introduction we could get the following result:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that the slit will be visible and you can feel it with your fingers, but it will be a fairly smooth indentation, not a sharp edge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Double walls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s expand on this technique to make it even more useful: Have you ever wanted to use vase mode but with two perimeters? We can build upon the previous trick to make a double wall:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is done by making a slit through into the hollow inside and making sure the part itself is exactly wide enough for two perimeters that touch. You can find the width you should use by going into PrusaSlicer (with the same settings that you plan to use to print with) and looking at the info text in “Print Settings” → “Layers and perimeters” → “Vertical shells”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is the value you want to use for this to work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can build upon this to make our internal geometry touch the opposite wall, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can also use this to anchor a slit to the outside wall. This allows us to anchor internal geometry to the outside wall without poking through. In fact, to ensure we have a single continuous outline, all but one slit must be done like this. The following picture shows what you need to do (note that the double wall thickness is 0.87 mm in this example, it will change depending on other settings):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two tricks presented so far form the basis of what I have seen called “unconventional vase mode”.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there are some more tricks related to vase mode that are worth knowing about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Extrusion width&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make a vase mode stronger, you can increase the extrusion width. The general recommendation is that you can go to about 2x the nozzle diameter and keep good quality. This works, since the nozzle has a bit of a flat spot around the orifice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, British Youtuber “Lost in Tech” did some tests showing that you can go way further than that, but I haven’t tested this myself, and quality does eventually start going down. It might be worth looking into if this is useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In PrusaSlicer you can change this in “Print Settings” → “Advanced” → “Extrusion width”. For vase mode “External perimeters” is what matters (above the solid base layers, that is):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember to rescale any double walls to fit the new extrusion width. It might be a good idea to use a variable in your CAD model to make it easier to update (at least if you use parametric CAD like OnShape, FreeCAD or Fusion 360 which support variables).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fake vase mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, if you absolutely cannot print something in vase mode you can still get most of the benefits by what I have seen called “fake vase mode”5. To understand this, we should first consider exactly what settings vase mode changes. In PrusaSlicer vase mode changes the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single perimeter (except for the first few bottom layers).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No top layers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No infill (except for the first few bottom layers).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No supports&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disables the setting “ensure vertical shell thickness”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prints in a continuous spiral path.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do all of those except 6 by hand in the slicer. And you can mix and match those first five things as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s investigate this via a case study rather than simplified theoretical examples like we have done so far&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Case study: spheres on sticks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I needed some spheres on the end of wooden sticks, to hold up a bird net over my strawberries on my balcony. I didn’t want the net to lie on the plants directly, and I needed something on the end of the sticks so that the net wouldn’t tear. Thus, spheres (or rather: truncated spheres for print bed adhesion and overhang reasons) on sticks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the basic design in a section view:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t quite work in vase mode, because the top of the sphere has very shallow overhangs. And the top needs to be smooth. (The “roof” of the internal hole is fine, thanks to the cone shape.) It is so close, we can almost use vase mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So first I designed this in CAD. We have a slit from the outside to the centre, as well as some slits from the centre that goes almost to the outside. In fact, they go to the “recommended object thin wall thickness” mentioned before. (Note that the slits do not go down into the solid bottom layers, for some additional strength.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This results in the following in PrusaSlicer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like true vase mode, I used zero infill. But I enabled “Ensure vertical shell thickness” and 1 top solid layer. This added a tiny bit of material just below the shallow top of the dome, making it printable, but still lighter than printing normally. Then I used a layer range modifier to disable “ensure vertical shell thickness” for the lower part of the print where it wasn’t needed, as PrusaSlicer wanted to add some material on the inside of the lower layers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also increased the extrusion width to 0.8 mm (with a 0.4 mm nozzle) to get additional strength, and I used scarf seams to make the outside seam almost invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can go further from true vase mode though: You could have an inner and outer perimeter like traditional non-vase slicing, but still model your own infill only where needed. You will get seams obviously, but you might still be able to print faster and save weight. We are moving further from true vase mode here, but only you can decide what exactly is best for your print:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, when I printed some of these spheres, the version without a slit to the outside ended up the best looking6:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The slit is visible, but on the part printed without a slit extending to the outside there are no visible seams at all. The unevenness at the top is due to me filing away a small blob that the nozzle left behind as it pulled away at the end. It is smooth to the touch but reflects the light differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vase mode and “fake vase mode” is an often underused printing mode for functional parts, and it can be used to save weight and print time. The difference will be most noticeable on larger parts, on smaller parts 10 vs 15 minutes might not be worth the extra design effort (unless you are planning to print many copies of the same part).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m a bit disappointed that the slit was as visible from the outside as it was. From the videos about RC aircraft wings that I saw I expected this to be less noticeable. But “fake vase mode” still comes to the rescue here, offering most of the benefits. And when combined with scarf joint seams (which I found truly impressive, first time I tried it), I don’t really see the need for true vase mode any more. You might as well get the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did not find any written resource online summarizing these techniques, so I hope this post is useful not just to remind myself in the future, but also to others looking for this information. With that in mind, below is a cheat sheet of the important points and settings to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These techniques require tuning settings in your slicer. This may not be possible if you are printing with at a commercial print farm, or targeting people slicing with a dumbed down web based slicer (as has recently been launched by both Printables and Makerworld). But it would be a shame if such dumbed down slicers restricted what we could design and publish. I will always try to make the most what both CAD and the slicer exposes to me.7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you have some other tips or tricks for vase mode? Did I get something wrong? Comment on Reddit or on Lemmy and I will likely see it (eventually).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cheat sheet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to quickly remind yourself of the core ideas of this article when you are designing your next part? Here is a quick cheat sheet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slits: Use slits to add internal geometry.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;0.0001 mm wide (or 0.001 if your CAD software doesn’t like you that day).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;PrusaSlicer: Set “Print Settings” → “Advanced” → “Slicing” → “Slice gap closing radius” to 0.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Double walls: Use double walls for more strength and to connect slits to the opposite wall.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;PrusaSlicer: “Print Settings” → “Layers and perimeters” → “Vertical shells” (Look at info text to find width you need to use for your current print settings.)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extrusion width: You can increase the extrusion width to 2x the nozzle diameter for additional strength with no quality downsides. You might be able to go even further, but eventually quality will start going down.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;PrusaSlicer: “Print Settings” → “Advanced” → “Extrusion width” → “External perimeters”&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fake vase mode: You don’t need to use vase mode to get most of the benefits. You can mix and match all parts of normal vase mode except for the continuous spiral path. But consider scarf joints to hide seams.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You might need to experiment with the specific value to make your CAD program and slicer happy. With OnShape, sometimes 0.0001 mm works, sometimes only 0.001 mm works (or Onshape doesn’t see the slit), and I don’t know why exactly. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The first mention I can find of this is in this video by Tom Stanton, but I cannot say for sure that this is where it originated. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I found this solution from this forum post. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unconventional vase mode is briefly mentioned in this excellent but long blog post about designing for 3D printing. I strongly recommend reading it if you want to make your CAD designs portable between different printers and for general tips on how to design to avoid supports, and in general make full use of the peculiarities of the manufacturing method. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I “semi-invented” this method myself, but then found out I wasn’t first. I was thinking “wouldn’t it be possible to…” and then I googled and found this video by “BV3D: Bryan Vines”, that already discussed this idea, though it takes a while to get to the point. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Printed with AddNorth Economy PETG, white. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I even considered using Full Control XYZ for a minute to have true vase mode and then switch back to non-vase mode on top. In the end I came to my senses and decided not to write my model with Python code. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple's Problem with Bodies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building for iOS sometimes feels like archaeology: brush away enough guidelines and you hit something older and stranger. A system that can classify violence with forensic precision still can't decide if the human body is health, lifestyle, or sin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day I tried to ship a private intimacy tracker–nothing scandalous, just a journal for wellbeing–and App Store Connect assigned it the 16+ rating it uses for gambling apps and "unrestricted web access". The rating itself is fine: the target audience is well past that age anyway. What baffles me is the logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Silk–the app I’m talking about, almost reluctantly–is a wellbeing journal in the most boring sense possible. You choose a few words about your day, moods, closeness, symptoms, or whatever else matters to you and your partner(s). It lives entirely on-device, syncs with nothing and phones no one. The whole point is that nothing interesting happens to your data after you close the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, from the App Store’s point of view, you can build a game with guns and cartoon violence and happily ship it to kids, while tracking your own body needs a 16+ “mature themes” label.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the grey zone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Category With No Name ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you were around for the early App Store, you’ll remember its optimism: accelerometer-driven beer glasses, wobbling jelly icons, flashlight apps that set brightness to 100% because no one had ever considered the idea before. The ecosystem assumed “content” meant pictures, sound, or the occasional cow-milking simulator–not a user quietly describing part of their life to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The App Store still carries the outline of that first life. Its vocabulary came from iTunes, which came from film ratings, built for a world where "content" meant something you could point a camera at. When the App Store arrived in 2008, it reused that system because it was available–and because no one expected apps to do much beyond wobbling or making noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those assumptions didn’t last. By 2009 the Store had hosted an infamous $999 app that did nothing but display a red gem, a game where you shook a crying baby until it died, and enough fart apps that one reportedly earned five figures daily[1]. The review process was learning in public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Against that backdrop, Apple introduced age ratings in mid-2009 with iOS 3. The strictest category, 17+, wasn't really created for gore or gambling–it was a pressure valve for novelty apps where shaking your phone made cartoon clothes fall off. Anything that might show “objectionable content”, from bikini galleries to embedded browsers, went into the same bucket[2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Change of Direction ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2010, Apple reversed course. After Steve Jobs declared "folks who want porn can buy an Android phone," thousands of sexy-but-not-explicit apps vanished overnight in what became known as the Great App Purge[3]. The platform moved from reactive cleanup to something more systematic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Age Ratings matrix Apple operates now in iOS 26 is far more precise. It defines violence with forensic granularity, subdivides gambling, categorises medical risk. It does all the things a global marketplace must do once everyone realises software can cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the matrix still retains its original silhouette: everything is defined by "content," not context. App Review's logic is keyed to artifacts inside the bundle–screenshots, metadata, stored assets–not to what the software actually does. That works beautifully for games and media. It falls apart when the "content" is whatever the user decides to write that day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Silk has no images, no user-generated photos, no feed, no external links. The matrix rated it 16+ anyway–the same tier as gambling apps and unrestricted browsers. The rating isn't describing what Silk does. It's describing the absence of a category that should exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What about Apple Health? ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When HealthKit launched in 2014, Apple consciously avoided anything resembling "behavioural interpretation." Heart rate or steps were fine, relationships were not. A decade later, the API surface has expanded in every direction–sleep depth, sound exposure, handwashing, environmental allergens, even a "Sexual Activity" field added quietly in iOS 9[4]. But relational wellbeing remains conspicuously absent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HealthKit tracks heart rate, inhaler usage, mindfulness minutes, and the more delicate end of gastrointestinal bookkeeping. Nowhere does it model intimacy, affection, or closeness–the things couples might actually want to track privately. If the platform doesn't have words for what you're building, the classification system can't label it correctly. The vocabulary doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple is not avoiding the topic here, they’re being literal. And when a system is literal in a domain that is inherently contextual, things start to get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Blind Spots Mean Constraints ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first place that breaks is search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple's search infrastructure is fast and strict. Search for "budget app" and you get budget apps. Search for "meditation" and you get meditation apps plus a few over-confident habit trackers. Search for the phrases people actually use when they want what Silk does–"relationship journal", "couples diary", "private moments"–and you get wedding planners, travel blogs, generic note-taking apps, and the occasional CBT worksheet. The algorithm can't read between lines it doesn't know exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Metadata Minefield ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the developer side, metadata stops being about discoverability and becomes a small diplomatic exercise. A few terms trigger moderation, a few trigger follow-up questions, and the keyword field turns into a minefield where every word is inspected for what it might imply rather than what it means. Too specific reads like medicine, too gentle reads like romance, and anything metaphorical gets outright rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't new though. In 2009, Ninjawords–a perfectly useful English dictionary–was delayed and forced into 17+ because it could return definitions for swear words[5]. Phil Schiller personally explained that since parental controls promised to filter profanity, any app displaying unfiltered words needed age-gating. Never mind that Safari could look up far worse. The rule was simple: uncurated content equals adult content, context be damned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also the "massage" rule, mostly folklorfe but widely believed: any app with that word in its metadata triggers extended review, whether it’s physiotherapy or post-marathon recovery. The system was burned once by apps using "massage" as euphemism and never forgot. Most of the odd heuristics you encounter today are scars from 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ambiguity in meaning becomes ambiguity in engineering. Without shared vocabulary, misalignment cascades: classification shapes search, search shapes metadata, metadata triggers review flags. The policies update faster than the taxonomy beneath them evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you see that, the problem becomes solvable–not culturally, but technically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Time to Poke the System ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I did the only sensible thing: treated App Store Connect like a black box and started running experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First test: keywords using only soft language–"relationship journal", "partner log", "connection tracker". Search rankings tanked. Silk dropped to page 8 for "relationship journal," outdone by printable worksheets for couples therapy. Good news: the algorithm was confident I wasn't selling anything objectionable. Bad news: it was equally confident I wasn't selling anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacing those with direct terms–"intimacy tracker", "sexual wellness", "couples health"–brought visibility back to page 2–3. It also triggered longer App Review cycles and required increasingly elaborate "Review Notes" explaining why the app shouldn't be rated 18+. Same binary, screenshots, and code, but different words in a metadata field neither the users nor I can even see in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Screenshots followed the same logic. Completely sterile set–empty fields, no microcopy, generic UI–sailed through but made Silk look like Notes with a different background. A more honest set showing what the app actually does triggered the 18+ question again. The framing changed the classification. The classification changed nothing about what the software does, but everything about where it appears and who finds it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of this is surprising if you assume the system is a classifier trained on categories from 2009. From the outside it feels arbitrary. From the inside it's doing exactly what it was built to do: match patterns it understands and escalate the ones it doesn’t. It just doesn't have a pattern for "private health journal that mentions bodies", even though there are lots of private health journals in the App Store these days. You can almost hear it thinking: This smells like health but reads like dating and contains the word 'intimacy.' Escalate!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designing Around the Gap ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Silk’s architecture was shaped by this lag in the same way Fermento’s safety checks were shaped by gaps in food-safety guidance, or Residency’s "compiler warnings" for travel emerged from inconsistent definitions of “presence” by different countries. It’s not a case study in “growth”; it’s just another example of what happens when you have to reverse-engineer the missing assumptions. When a domain refuses to state its rules, you provide the scaffolding yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the engineering time went into figuring out what not to build–not from fear of rejection, but from understanding how classifiers behave when they encounter undefined cases. Treat it like a compiler that hasn't learned your edge-case syntax yet and stay inside the subset of language it already understands. The discipline felt familiar–the same kind you develop when building in domains where the platform's rules aren't fully specified and you have to infer the boundaries from failed experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more carefully you specify what the app does, the less the platform has to guess on your behalf. In 2010, you could ship "Mood Scanner" apps that claimed to read emotional states from fingerprints. They still exist–the App Store didn't purge them–but try submitting one in a category App Review associates with actual health data and you'll trigger very different questions. The scrutiny isn't random; it’s contextual. It depends on how your metadata accidentally pattern-matches against old problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Life in the Grey Zone ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The closer Silk came to shipping, the more I understood the App Store's behaviour as conservatism–not ideological, but technical. The kind that keeps a global marketplace from accidentally approving malware. Some of this conservatism is regional: China's App Store has additional filters for "relationship content," South Korea requires separate disclosures for wellbeing data. Apple unifies this under one policy umbrella, which produces a system that's cautiously consistent across borders but not particularly imaginative about edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The post-Epic world made Apple more explicit about where liability lives. Ambiguity became expensive, underspecification became expensive, classifiers that behave "roughly right" became expensive. The safest rule became simple: if the system can't clearly state what something is, err on caution until the taxonomy expands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cost is that new categories appear slowly. Sleep apps lived on the periphery for years. Meditation apps bounced between "Health" and "Lifestyle" depending on screenshot aesthetics. Third-party cycle trackers existed for nearly a decade before Apple added native reproductive health tracking in 2015 and a dedicated Cycle Tracking experience in 2019[6]. Digital wellbeing apps faced suspicion until Screen Time shipped in iOS 12. Each category began as an edge case, proved itself through user adoption, and eventually got formalized–usually announced in a single sentence at WWDC as if it had always existed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Silk is at the beginning of that cycle. Eventually Apple will introduce a more nuanced descriptor, or HealthKit will model relational wellbeing, or the age matrix will gain more precision. The entire ecosystem will re-index overnight and everyone will move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out the best way to handle a category that doesn’t exist is to build as if it does, then wait for the taxonomy to catch up. Until then, the grey zone is honestly not a bad neighbourhood. The users already know what the app is for. The platform will figure it out eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working in the quiet gaps of the platform? I build iOS software for the problems people don’t talk about. work@drobinin.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I Am Rich sold for $999.99 to eight people before Apple quietly yanked it. Baby Shaker made it through review until the backlash arrived. And iFart really did clear ~$10k/day at its peak. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The 17+ category arrived with iOS 3 in 2009. Officially it covered “mature themes” and gambling. Unofficially it was the overflow bin for anything vaguely sexy–from Wobble iBoobs to apps with embedded browsers, RSS readers, and Twitter clients, all lumped together because they might show something naughty. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The 2010 “Great App Purge”: 5–6k sexy-but-not-explicit apps disappeared overnight after Steve Jobs dropped the immortal “Folks who want porn can buy an Android phone.” A rare moment where Apple said the quiet part out loud. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HealthKit launched in iOS 8 with vitals and fitness but no reproductive health. Apple added “Sexual Activity” in iOS 9–a year after everyone noticed the omission. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ninjawords, a dictionary, was rated 17+ because it could return swear words. Behold: a dictionary rated like a strip-poker app, because it contained words the app reviewers searched for on purpose. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Third-party cycle trackers existed for years, but Apple didn’t add reproductive health metrics until iOS 9 (2015), and didn’t ship dedicated Cycle Tracking until iOS 13 (2019). A category legitimised years after users created it. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I learned Vulkan and wrote a small game engine with it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tl;dr: I learned some Vulkan and made a game engine with two small game demos in 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code for the engine and the games can be found here: https://github.com/eliasdaler/edbr&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Table Of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article documents my experience of learning Vulkan and writing a small game/engine with it. It took me around 3 months to do it without any previous knowledge of Vulkan (I had previous OpenGL experience and some experience with making game engines, though).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engine wasn’t implemented as a general purpose engine, which is probably why it took me a few months (and not years) to achieve this. I started by making a small 3D game and separated reusable parts into the “engine” afterwards. I can recommend everyone to follow the same process to not get stuck in the weeds (see “Bike-shedding” section below for more advice).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m a professional programmer, but I’m self-taught in graphics programming. I started studying graphics programming around 1.5 years ago by learning OpenGL and writing a 3D engine in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engine I wrote in Vulkan is mostly suited for smaller level-based games. I’ll explain things which worked for me, but they might not be the most efficient. My implementation would probably still be a good starting point for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Hopefully, this article will help make some things about Vulkan clearer to you. But you also need to be patient. It took me months to implement what I have today and I did it by cutting corners in many places. But if a self-taught programmer like me can build something with Vulkan, then so can you!&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Learning graphics programming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;This is a very high level overview of how I learned some graphics programming myself. If there’s interest, I might write another article with more resources and helpful guidelines.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t done any graphics programming before, you should start with OpenGL. It’s much easier to learn it and not get overwhelmed by all the complexity that Vulkan has. A lot of your OpenGL and graphics programming knowledge will be useful when you start doing things with Vulkan later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally, you should at least get a textured model displayed on the screen with some simple Blinn-Phong lighting. I can also recommend doing some basic shadow mapping too, so that you learn how to render your scene from a different viewpoint and to a different render target, how to sample from depth textures and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can recommend using the following resources to learn OpenGL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;https://learnopengl.com/&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anton’s OpenGL 4 Tutorials book&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thorsten ThormÃ¤hlen’s lectures lectures (watch the first 6 videos, the rest might be a bit too advanced)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, most OpenGL resources don’t teach the latest OpenGL 4.6 practices. They make writing OpenGL a lot more enjoyable. If you learn them, transitioning to Vulkan will be much easier (I only learned about OpenGL 3.3 during my previous engine development, though, so it’s not a necessity).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some resources which teach you the latest OpenGL practices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;https://juandiegomontoya.github.io/modern_opengl.html&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;https://github.com/fendevel/Guide-to-Modern-OpenGL-Functions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;It’s also good to have some math knowledge, especially linear algebra: how to work with vectors, transformation matrices and quaternions. My favorite book about linear algebra/math is 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development by F. Dunn and I. Parbery. You don’t need to read it all in one go - use it as a reference if some math in the OpenGL resources above doesn’t make sense to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bike-shedding and how to avoid it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, bike-shedding… Basically, it’s a harmful pattern of overthinking and over-engineering even the simplest things. It’s easy to fall into this trap when doing graphics programming (especially when doing Vulkan since you need to make many choices when implementing an engine with it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Always ask yourself “Do I really need this?”, “Will this thing ever become a bottleneck?”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remember that you can always rewrite any part of your game/engine later.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t implement something unless you need it right now. Don’t think “Well, a good engine needs X, right…?”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t try to make a general purpose game engine. It’s probably even better to not think about “the engine” at first and write a simple game.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a small game first - a Breakout clone, for example. Starting your engine development by doing a Minecraft clone with multiplayer support is probably not a good idea.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be wary of people who tend to suggest complicated solutions to simple problems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t look too much at what other people do. I’ve seen many over-engineered engines on GitHub - sometimes they’re that complex for a good reason (and there are years of work behind them). But you probably don’t need most of that complexity, especially for simpler games.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t try to make magical wrappers around Vulkan interfaces prematurely, especially while you’re still learning Vulkan.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get it working first. Leave “TODO”/“FIXME” comments in some places. Then move on to the next thing. Try to fix “TODO”/“FIXME” places only when they really become problematic or bottleneck your performance. You’ll be surprised to see how many things won’t become a problem at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Some of this advice only applies when you’re working alone on a hobby project. Of course, it’s much harder to rewrite something from scratch when others start to depend on it and a “temp hack” becomes a fundamental part of the engine which is very hard to change without breaking many things.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Vulkan?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ask yourself if you need to learn a graphics API at all. If your main goal is to make a game as soon as possible, then you might be better off using something like Godot or Unreal Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, there’s nothing wrong with reinventing the wheel or doing something from scratch. Especially if you do it just for fun, to get into graphics programming or to get an in-depth knowledge about how something works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The situation with graphic APIs in 2024 is somewhat complicated. It all depends on the use case: DirectX seems like the most solid choice for most AAA games. WebGL or WebGPU are the only two choices for doing 3D graphics on the web. Metal is the go-to graphics API on macOS and iOS (though you can still do Vulkan there via MoltenVK).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My use case is simple: I want to make small 3D games for desktop platforms (Windows and Linux mostly). I also love open source technology and open standards. So, it was a choice between OpenGL and Vulkan for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenGL is a good enough choice for many small games. But it’s very unlikely that it’ll get new versions in the future (so you can’t use some newest GPU capabilities like ray tracing), it’s deprecated on macOS and its future is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WebGPU was also a possible choice. Before learning Vulkan, I learned some of it. It’s a pretty solid API, but I had some problems with it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s still not stable and there’s not a lot of tutorials and examples for it. This tutorial is fantastic, though.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WGSL is an okay shading language, but I just find its syntax not as pleasant as GLSL’s (note that you can write in GLSL and then load compiled SPIR-V on WebGPU native).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On desktop, it’s essentially a wrapper around other graphic APIs (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal).This introduces additional problems for me: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;It can’t do things some things that Vulkan or DirectX can do.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It has more limitations than native graphic APIs since it needs to behave similarly between them.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;RenderDoc captures become confusing as they differ between the platforms (you can get DirectX capture on Windows and Vulkan capture on Linux) and you don’t have 1-to-1 mapping between WebGPU calls and native API calls.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Using Dawn and WGPU feels like using bgfx or sokol. You don’t get the same degree of control over the GPU and some of the choices/abstractions might not be the most pleasant for you.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No bindless textures (WIP discussion here).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No push constants (WIP discussion here).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, I think that WebGPU is a better API than OpenGL/WebGL and can be more useful to you than Vulkan in some use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Validation errors are much better than in OpenGL/WebGL and not having global state helps a lot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s also kind of similar to Vulkan in many things, so learning a bit of it before diving into Vulkan also helped me a lot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It requires a lot less boilerplate to get things on the screen (compared to Vulkan).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You don’t have to deal with explicit synchronization which makes things much simpler.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can make your games playable inside the browser.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Learning Vulkan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learning Vulkan seemed like an impossible thing for me previously. It felt like you needed to have many years of AAA game graphics programming experience to be able to do things in it. You also hear people saying “you’re basically writing a graphics driver when writing in Vulkan” which also made Vulkan sounds like an incredibly complicated thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have also checked out some engines written in Vulkan before and was further demotivated by seeing tons of scary abstractions and files named like &lt;code&gt;GPUDevice.cpp&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;GPUAbstraction.cpp&lt;/code&gt; which had thousands of lines of scary C++ code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The situation has changed over the years. Vulkan is not as complicated as it was before. First of all, Khronos realized that some parts of Vulkan were indeed very complex and introduced some newer features which made many things much simpler (for example, dynamic rendering). Secondly, some very useful libraries which reduce boilerplate were implemented. And finally, there are a lot of fantastic resources which make learning Vulkan much easier than it was before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best Vulkan learning resource which helped me get started was vkguide. If you’re starting from scratch, just go through it all (you might stop at “GPU driver rendering” chapter at first - many simple games probably won’t need this level of complexity)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan Lecture Series by TU Wien also nicely teaches Vulkan basics (you can probably skip “Real-Time Ray Tracing” chapter for now). I especially found a lecture on synchronization very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some more advanced Vulkan books that also helped me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3D Graphics Rendering Cookbook by Sergey Kosarevsky and Viktor Latypov. There is the second edition in the writing and it’s promising to be better than the first one. The second edition is not released yet, but the source code for it can be found here: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/3D-Graphics-Rendering-Cookbook-Second-Edition&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mastering Graphics Programming with Vulkan by Marco Castorina, Gabriel Sassone. Very advanced book which explains some of the “cutting edge” graphics programming concepts (I mostly read it to understand where to go further, but didn’t have time to implement most of it). The source code for it can be found here: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Graphics-Programming-with-Vulkan&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the result of my first month of learning Vulkan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By this point I had:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;glTF model loading&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compute skinning&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frustum culling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shadow mapping and cascaded shadow maps&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, doing it for the 3rd time (I had it implemented it all in OpenGL and WebGPU before) certainly helped. Once you get to this point, Vulkan won’t seem as scary anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see how the engine works and some useful things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Engine overview and frame analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://github.com/eliasdaler/edbr&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My engine is called EDBR (Elias Daler’s Bikeshed Engine) and was initially started as a project for learning Vulkan. It quickly grew into a somewhat usable engine which I’m going to use for my further projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this article, the source code line counts are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Engine itself: 19k lines of code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;6.7k LoC related to graphics,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2k LoC are light abstractions around Vulkan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3D cat game: 4.6k LoC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2D platformer game: 1.2k LoC&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I copy-pasted some non-graphics related stuff from my previous engine (e.g. input handling and audio system) but all of the graphics and many other core systems were rewritten from scratch. I feel like it was a good way to do it instead of trying to cram Vulkan into my old OpenGL abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;You can follow the commit history which shows how I started from clearing the screen, drawing the first triangle, drawing a textured quad and so on. It might be easier to understand the engine when it was simpler and smaller.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see how this frame in rendered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Most of the steps will be explained in more detail below.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Skinning&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, models with skeletal animations are skinned in the compute shader. The compute shader takes unskinned mesh and produces a buffer of vertices which are then used instead of the original mesh in later rendering steps. This allows me to treat static and skinned meshes similarly in shaders and not do skinning repeatedly in different rendering steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CSM (Cascaded Shadow Mapping)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use a 4096x4096 depth texture with 3 slices for cascaded shadow mapping. The first slice looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Geometry + shading&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the models are drawn and shading is calculated using the shadow map and light info. I use a PBR model which is almost identical to the one described in Physically Based Rendering in Filament. The fragment shader is quite big and does calculation for all the lights affecting the drawn mesh in one draw call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything is drawn into a multi-sampled texture. Here’s how it looks after resolve:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Open the previous two screenshots in the next tab and flip between the tabs to see the difference more clearly)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Depth resolve&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depth resolve step is performed manually via a fragment shader. I just go through all the fragments of multi-sample depth texture and write the minimum value into the non-MS depth texture (it’ll be useful in the next step).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post FX&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some post FX is applied - right now it’s only depth fog (I use “depth resolve” texture from the previous step here), afterwards tone-mapping and bloom will also be done here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UI&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dialogue UI is drawn. Everything is done in one draw call (more is explained in “Drawing many sprites” section)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s it! It’s pretty basic right now and would probably become much more complex in the future (see “Future work” section).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;General advice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Recommended Vulkan libraries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a couple of libraries which greatly improve the experience of writing Vulkan. Most of them are already used in vkguide, but I still want to highlight how helpful they were to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;vk-bootstrap - https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vk-bootstrap simplifies a lot of Vulkan boilerplate: physical device selection, swapchain creation and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t like big wrappers around graphic APIs because they tend to be very opinionated. Plus, you need to keep a mental map of “wrapper function vs function in the API spec” in your head at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, vk-bootstrap is not like this. It mostly affects the initialization step of your program and doesn’t attempt to be a wrapper around every Vulkan function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;When I was learning Vulkan, I started doing Vulkan from scratch, without using any 3rd party libraries. Replacing big amounts of the initialization code with vk-bootstrap was a joy. It’s really worth it.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA) - https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, I used VMA without even learning about how to allocate memory in Vulkan manually. I read about it in the Vulkan spec later - I’m glad that I didn’t have to do it on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;volk&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Volk was very useful for me for simplifying extension function loading. For example, if you want to use very useful &lt;code&gt;vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT&lt;/code&gt; for setting debug names for your objects (useful for RenderDoc captures and validation errors), you’ll need to do this if you don’t use volk:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// store this pointer somewhere
PFN_vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT pfnSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT;

// during your game init
pfnSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT = (PFN_vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT)
    vkGetInstanceProcAddr(instance, "vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT");

// and finally in your game code
pfnSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT(device, ...);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With volk, all the extensions are immediately loaded after you call &lt;code&gt;volkInitialize&lt;/code&gt; and you don’t need to store these pointers everywhere. You just include &lt;code&gt;volk.h&lt;/code&gt; and call &lt;code&gt;vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT&lt;/code&gt; - beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GfxDevice abstraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;code&gt;GfxDevice&lt;/code&gt; class which encapsulates most of the commonly used functionality and stores many objects that you need for calling Vulkan functions (&lt;code&gt;VkDevice&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VkQueue&lt;/code&gt; and so on). A single &lt;code&gt;GfxDevice&lt;/code&gt; instance is created on the startup and then gets passed around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It handles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vulkan context initialization.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swapchain creation and management.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;beginFrame&lt;/code&gt;returns a new&lt;code&gt;VkCommandBuffer&lt;/code&gt;which is later used in all the drawing steps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;endFrame&lt;/code&gt;does drawing to the swapchain and does sync between the frames.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image creation and loading textures from files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Buffer creation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bindless descriptor set management (see “Bindless descriptors” section below).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s… a lot of things. However, it’s not that big: &lt;code&gt;GfxDevice.cpp&lt;/code&gt; is only 714 lines at the time of writing this article. It’s more convenient to pass one object into the function instead of many (&lt;code&gt;VkDevice&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VkQueue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VmaAllocator&lt;/code&gt; and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Handling shaders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Vulkan, you can use any shading language which compiles to SPIR-V - that means that you can use GLSL, HLSL and others. I chose GLSL because I already knew it from my OpenGL experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can pre-compile your shaders during the build step or compile them on the fly. I do it during the build so that my shader loading runtime code is simpler. I also don’t have an additional runtime dependency on the shader compiler. Also, shader errors are detected during the build step and I don’t get compile errors during the runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use glslc (from shaderc project, it’s included in Vulkan SDK) which allows you to specify a &lt;code&gt;DEPFILE&lt;/code&gt; in CMake which is incredibly useful when you use shader includes. If you change a shader file, all files which include it are recompiled automatically. Without the &lt;code&gt;DEPFILE&lt;/code&gt;, CMake won’t be able to see which files shader files need to be recompiled and will only recompile the file which was changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My CMake script for building shaders looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;function (target_shaders target shaders)
    set(SHADERS_BUILD_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/shaders")
    file(MAKE_DIRECTORY "${SHADERS_BUILD_DIR}")
    foreach (SHADER_PATH ${SHADERS})
        get_filename_component(SHADER_FILENAME "${SHADER_PATH}" NAME)
        set(SHADER_SPIRV_PATH "${SHADERS_BUILD_DIR}/${SHADER_FILENAME}.spv")
        set(DEPFILE "${SHADER_SPIRV_PATH}.d")
        add_custom_command(
          COMMENT "Building ${SHADER_FILENAME}"
          OUTPUT "${SHADER_SPIRV_PATH}"
          COMMAND ${GLSLC} "${SHADER_PATH}" -o "${SHADER_SPIRV_PATH}" -MD -MF ${DEPFILE} -g
          DEPENDS "${SHADER_PATH}"
          DEPFILE "${DEPFILE}"
        )
        list(APPEND SPIRV_BINARY_FILES ${SHADER_SPIRV_PATH})
    endforeach()

    set(shaders_target_name "${target}_build_shaders")
    add_custom_target(${shaders_target_name}
      DEPENDS ${SPIRV_BINARY_FILES}
    )
    add_dependencies(${target} ${shaders_target_name})
endfunction()
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and then in the main CMakeLists file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;set(SHADERS
    skybox.frag
    skinning.comp
    ... // etc
)

# prepend shaders directory path
get_target_property(EDBR_SOURCE_DIR edbr SOURCE_DIR)
set(EDBR_SHADERS_DIR "${EDBR_SOURCE_DIR}/src/shaders/")
list(TRANSFORM SHADERS PREPEND "${EDBR_SHADERS_DIR}")

target_shaders(game ${SHADERS})
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, when you build a &lt;code&gt;game&lt;/code&gt; target, shaders get built automatically and the resulting SPIR-V files are put into the binary directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Push constants, descriptor sets and bindless descriptors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Passing data to shaders in OpenGL is much simpler than it is in Vulkan. In OpenGL, you could just do this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In shader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uniform float someFloat;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In C++ code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const auto loc = glGetUniformLocation(shader, "someFloat");
glUseProgram(shader);
glUniform1f(loc, 42.f);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also use explicit uniform location like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In shader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;layout(location = 20) uniform float someFloat;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const auto loc = 20;
glUniform1f(loc, 42.f);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Vulkan, you need to group your uniforms into “descriptor sets”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// set 0
layout (set = 0, binding = 0) uniform float someFloat;
layout (set = 0, binding = 1) uniform mat4 someMatrix;
// set 1
layout (set = 1, binding = 0) uniform float someOtherFloat;
... // etc.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, this makes things a lot more complicated, because you need to specify descriptor set layout beforehand, use descriptor set pools and allocate descriptor sets with them, do the whole &lt;code&gt;VkWriteDescriptorSet&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;vkUpdateDescriptorSets&lt;/code&gt; thing, call &lt;code&gt;vkCmdBindDescriptorSets&lt;/code&gt; for each descriptor set and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll explain later how I avoided using descriptor sets by using bindless descriptors and buffer device access. Basically, I only have one “global” descriptor set for bindless textures and samplers, and that’s it. Everything else is passed via push constants which makes everything much easier to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Pipeline pattern&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I separate drawing steps into “pipeline” classes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of them look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class PostFXPipeline {
public:
    void init(GfxDevice&amp;amp; gfxDevice, VkFormat drawImageFormat);
    void cleanup(VkDevice device);

    void draw(
        VkCommandBuffer cmd,
        GfxDevice&amp;amp; gfxDevice,
        const GPUImage&amp;amp; drawImage,
        const GPUImage&amp;amp; depthImage,
        const GPUBuffer&amp;amp; sceneDataBuffer);

private:
    VkPipelineLayout pipelineLayout;
    VkPipeline pipeline;

    struct PushConstants {
        VkDeviceAddress sceneDataBuffer;
        std::uint32_t drawImageId;
        std::uint32_t depthImageId;
    };
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt;loads needed shaders and initializes&lt;code&gt;pipeline&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;pipelineLayout&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void PostFXPipeline::init(GfxDevice&amp;amp; gfxDevice, VkFormat drawImageFormat)
{
    const auto&amp;amp; device = gfxDevice.getDevice();

    const auto pcRange = VkPushConstantRange{
        .stageFlags = VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT,
        .offset = 0,
        .size = sizeof(PushConstants),
    };

    const auto layouts = std::array{gfxDevice.getBindlessDescSetLayout()};
    const auto pushConstantRanges = std::array{pcRange};
    pipelineLayout = vkutil::createPipelineLayout(device, layouts, pushConstantRanges);

    const auto vertexShader =
        vkutil::loadShaderModule("shaders/fullscreen_triangle.vert.spv", device);
    const auto fragShader =
        vkutil::loadShaderModule("shaders/postfx.frag.spv", device);
    pipeline = PipelineBuilder{pipelineLayout}
                   .setShaders(vertexShader, fragShader)
                   .setInputTopology(VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST)
                   .setPolygonMode(VK_POLYGON_MODE_FILL)
                   .disableCulling()
                   .setMultisamplingNone()
                   .disableBlending()
                   .setColorAttachmentFormat(drawImageFormat)
                   .disableDepthTest()
                   .build(device);
    vkutil::addDebugLabel(device, pipeline, "postFX pipeline");

    vkDestroyShaderModule(device, vertexShader, nullptr);
    vkDestroyShaderModule(device, fragShader, nullptr);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; function is usually called once during the engine initialization. &lt;code&gt;PipelineBuilder&lt;/code&gt; abstraction is described in vkguide here. I modified it a bit to use the Builder pattern to be able to chain the calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;cleanup&lt;/code&gt;does all the needed cleanup. It usually simply destroys the pipeline and its layout:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void PostFXPipeline::cleanup(VkDevice device)
{
    vkDestroyPipeline(device, pipeline, nullptr);
    vkDestroyPipelineLayout(device, pipelineLayout, nullptr);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt;is called each frame and all the needed inputs are passed as arguments. It’s assumed that the sync is performed outside of the&lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt;call (see “Synchronization” section below). Some pipelines are only called once per frame - some either take&lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;of objects to draw or are called like this:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for (const auto&amp;amp; mesh : meshes) {
    somePipeline.draw(cmd, gfxDevice, mesh, ...);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The typical &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void PostFXPipeline::draw(
    VkCommandBuffer cmd,
    GfxDevice&amp;amp; gfxDevice,
    const GPUImage&amp;amp; drawImage,
    const GPUImage&amp;amp; depthImage,
    const GPUBuffer&amp;amp; sceneDataBuffer)
{
    // Bind the pipeline
    vkCmdBindPipeline(cmd, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, pipeline);

    // Bind the bindless descriptor set
    gfxDevice.bindBindlessDescSet(cmd, pipelineLayout);

    // Handle push constants
    const auto pcs = PushConstants{
        // BDA - explained below
        .sceneDataBuffer = sceneDataBuffer.address,
        // bindless texture ids - no need for desc. sets!
        // explained below
        .drawImageId = drawImage.getBindlessId(),
        .depthImageId = depthImage.getBindlessId(),
    };
    vkCmdPushConstants(
        cmd, pipelineLayout, VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT, 0, sizeof(PushConstants), &amp;amp;pcs);

    // Finally, do some drawing. Here we're drawing a fullscreen triangle
    // to do a full-screen effect.
    vkCmdDraw(cmd, 3, 1, 0, 0);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note another thing: it’s assumed that &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; is called between &lt;code&gt;vkCmdBeginRendering&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vkCmdEndRendering&lt;/code&gt; - the render pass itself doesn’t care what texture it renders to - the caller of &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; is responsible for that. It makes things simpler and allows you to do several draws to the same render target, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// handy wrapper for creating VkRenderingInfo
const auto renderInfo = vkutil::createRenderingInfo({
    .renderExtent = drawImage.getExtent2D(),
    .colorImageView = drawImage.imageView,
    .colorImageClearValue = glm::vec4{0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 1.f},
    .depthImageView = depthImage.imageView,
    .depthImageClearValue = 0.f,
    // for MSAA
    .resolveImageView = resolveImage.imageView,
});

vkCmdBeginRendering(cmd, &amp;amp;renderInfo.renderingInfo);

// draw meshes
for (const auto&amp;amp; mesh : meshesToDraw) {
    meshPipeline.draw(cmd, gfxDevice, mesh, ...);
}
// draw sky
skyboxPipeline.draw(cmd, gfxDevice, camera);

vkCmdEndRendering(cmd);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I use&lt;code&gt;VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering&lt;/code&gt;everywhere. I don’t use Vulkan render passes and subpasses at all. I’ve heard that they’re more efficient on tile-based GPUs, but I don’t care about mobile support for now.&lt;code&gt;VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering&lt;/code&gt;just makes everything much easier.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Using programmable vertex pulling (PVP) + buffer device address (BDA)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have one vertex type for all the meshes. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct Vertex {
    vec3 position;
    float uv_x;
    vec3 normal;
    float uv_y;
    vec4 tangent;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Of course, you can greatly optimize it using various methods, but it’s good enough for me for now. The&lt;code&gt;uv_x&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;uv_y&lt;/code&gt;separation comes from vkguide - I think it’s a nice idea to get good alignment and not waste any bytes&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vertices are accessed in the shader like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;layout (buffer_reference, std430) readonly buffer VertexBuffer {
    Vertex vertices[];
};

layout (push_constant, scalar) uniform constants
{
    VertexBuffer vertexBuffer;
    ... // other stuff
} pcs;

void main()
{
    Vertex v = pcs.vertexBuffer.vertices[gl_VertexIndex];
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PVP frees you from having to define vertex format (no more VAOs like in OpenGL or &lt;code&gt;VkVertexInputBindingDescription&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;VkVertexInputAttributeDescription&lt;/code&gt; in Vulkan). BDA also frees you from having to bind a buffer to a descriptor set - you just pass an address to your buffer which contains vertices in push constants and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
  Also note the  scalar layout for push constants. I use it for all the buffers too. Compared to “std430” layout, it makes alignment a lot more easy to handle - it almost works the same as in C++ and greatly reduces the need for “padding” members in C++ structs.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bindless descriptors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Textures were painful to work with even in OpenGL - you had “texture slots” which were awkward to work with. You couldn’t just sample any texture from the shader if it wasn’t bound to a texture slot beforehand. &lt;code&gt;ARB_bindless_texture&lt;/code&gt; changed that and made many things easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan doesn’t have the exact same functionality, but it has something similar. You can create big descriptor sets which look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// bindless.glsl
layout (set = 0, binding = 0) uniform texture2D textures[];
...
layout (set = 0, binding = 1) uniform sampler samplers[];
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll need to maintain a list of all your textures using some “image manager” and when a new texture is loaded, you need to insert it into the &lt;code&gt;textures&lt;/code&gt; array. The index at which you inserted it becomes a bindless “texture id” which then can be used to sample it in shaders. Now you can pass these ids in your push constants like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;layout (push_constant, scalar) uniform constants
{
  uint textureId;
  ...
} pcs;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and then you can sample your texture in the fragment shader like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// bindless.glsl
#define NEAREST_SAMPLER_ID 0
...

vec4 sampleTexture2DNearest(uint texID, vec2 uv) {
    return texture(nonuniformEXT(sampler2D(textures[texID], samplers[NEAREST_SAMPLER_ID])), uv);
}

// shader.frag
vec4 color = sampleTexture2DNearest(pcs.textureId, inUV);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two things to note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I chose separate image samplers so that I could sample any texture using different samplers. Common samplers (nearest, linear with anisotropy, depth texture samplers) are created and put into &lt;code&gt;samplers&lt;/code&gt;array on the startup.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The wrapper function makes the process of sampling a lot more convenient.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
  The placement of  nonuniformEXT is somewhat tricky and is explained very well here.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use bindless ids for the mesh material buffer which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct MaterialData {
    vec4 baseColor;
    vec4 metallicRoughnessEmissive;
    uint diffuseTex;
    uint normalTex;
    uint metallicRoughnessTex;
    uint emissiveTex;
};

layout (buffer_reference, std430) readonly buffer MaterialsBuffer {
    MaterialData data[];
} materialsBuffer;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I can only pass material ID in my push constants and then sample texture like this in the fragment shader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;MaterialData material = materials[pcs.materialID];
vec4 diffuse = sampleTexture2DLinear(material.diffuseTex, inUV);
...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neat! No more bulky descriptor sets, just one int per material in the push constants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also put different texture types into the same set like this (this is needed for being able to access textures of types other than &lt;code&gt;texture2D&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;layout (set = 0, binding = 0) uniform texture2D textures[];
layout (set = 0, binding = 0) uniform texture2DMS texturesMS[];
layout (set = 0, binding = 0) uniform textureCube textureCubes[];
layout (set = 0, binding = 0) uniform texture2DArray textureArrays[];
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here’s how you can sample &lt;code&gt;textureCube&lt;/code&gt; with a linear sampler (note that we use &lt;code&gt;textureCubes&lt;/code&gt; here instead of &lt;code&gt;textures&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;vec4 sampleTextureCubeLinear(uint texID, vec3 p) {
    return texture(nonuniformEXT(samplerCube(textureCubes[texID], samplers[NEAREST_SAMPLER_ID])), p);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a very good article on using bindless textures in Vulkan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://jorenjoestar.github.io/post/vulkan_bindless_texture/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Handling dynamic data which needs to be uploaded every frame&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find it useful to pre-allocate big arrays of things and push stuff to them in every frame. Basically, you can pre-allocate an array of N structs (or matrices) and then start at index 0 at each new frame and push things to it from the CPU. Then, you can access all these items in your shaders. For example, I have all joint matrices stored in one big &lt;code&gt;mat4&lt;/code&gt; array and the skinning compute shader accesses joint matrices of a particular mesh using start index passed via push constants (more about it will be explained later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are two ways of doing this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Have N buffers on GPU and swap between them.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vkguide explains the concept of “in flight” frames pretty well. To handle this parallelism properly, you need to have one buffer for the “currently drawing” frame and one buffer for “currently recording new drawing commands” frame to not have races. (If you have more frames in flight, you’ll need to allocate more than 2 buffers)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that you need to preallocate 2 buffers on GPU. You write data from CPU to GPU to the first buffer during the first frame. While you record the second frame, GPU reads from the first buffer while you write new data to the second buffer. On the third frame, GPU reads from the second buffer and you write new info to the first buffer… and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;One buffer on GPU and N “staging” buffers on CPU&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be useful if you need to conserve some memory on the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see how it works in my engine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class NBuffer {
public:
    void init(
        GfxDevice&amp;amp; gfxDevice,
        VkBufferUsageFlags usage,
        std::size_t dataSize,
        std::size_t numFramesInFlight,
        const char* label);

    void cleanup(GfxDevice&amp;amp; gfxDevice);

    void uploadNewData(
        VkCommandBuffer cmd,
        std::size_t frameIndex,
        void* newData,
        std::size_t dataSize,
        std::size_t offset = 0);

    const GPUBuffer&amp;amp; getBuffer() const { return gpuBuffer; }

private:
    std::size_t framesInFlight{0};
    std::size_t gpuBufferSize{0};
    std::vector&amp;lt;GPUBuffer&amp;gt; stagingBuffers;
    GPUBuffer gpuBuffer;
    bool initialized{false};
};

void NBuffer::init(
    GfxDevice&amp;amp; gfxDevice,
    VkBufferUsageFlags usage,
    std::size_t dataSize,
    std::size_t numFramesInFlight,
    const char* label)
{
    ...

    gpuBuffer = gfxDevice.createBuffer(
        dataSize, usage | VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT, VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_AUTO_PREFER_DEVICE);
    vkutil::addDebugLabel(gfxDevice.getDevice(), gpuBuffer.buffer, label);

    for (std::size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; numFramesInFlight; ++i) {
        stagingBuffers.push_back(gfxDevice.createBuffer(
            dataSize, usage | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT, VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_AUTO_PREFER_HOST));
    }

    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note how staging buffers are created using VMA’s &lt;code&gt;PREFER_HOST&lt;/code&gt; flag and the “main” buffer from which we read in the shader is using the &lt;code&gt;PREFER_DEVICE&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how new data is uploaded (full implementation):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void NBuffer::uploadNewData(
    VkCommandBuffer cmd,
    std::size_t frameIndex,
    void* newData,
    std::size_t dataSize,
    std::size_t offset) const
{
    assert(initialized);
    assert(frameIndex &amp;lt; framesInFlight);
    assert(offset + dataSize &amp;lt;= gpuBufferSize &amp;amp;&amp;amp; "NBuffer::uploadNewData: out of bounds write");

    if (dataSize == 0) {
        return;
    }

    // sync with previous read
    ... // READ BARRIER CODE HERE

    auto&amp;amp; staging = stagingBuffers[frameIndex];
    auto* mappedData = reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;std::uint8_t*&amp;gt;(staging.info.pMappedData);
    memcpy((void*)&amp;amp;mappedData[offset], newData, dataSize);

    const auto region = VkBufferCopy2{
        .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_COPY_2,
        .srcOffset = (VkDeviceSize)offset,
        .dstOffset = (VkDeviceSize)offset,
        .size = dataSize,
    };
    const auto bufCopyInfo = VkCopyBufferInfo2{
        .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COPY_BUFFER_INFO_2,
        .srcBuffer = staging.buffer,
        .dstBuffer = gpuBuffer.buffer,
        .regionCount = 1,
        .pRegions = &amp;amp;region,
    };

    vkCmdCopyBuffer2(cmd, &amp;amp;bufCopyInfo);

    // sync with write
    ... // WRITE BARRIER CODE HERE
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d go with the first approach for most cases (more data on GPU, but no need for manual sync) unless you need to conserve GPU memory for some reason. I’ve found no noticeable difference in performance between two approaches, but it might matter if you are uploading huge amounts of data to GPU on each frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Destructors, deletion queue and cleanup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, this might be somewhat controversial… but I didn’t find much use of the deletion queue pattern used in vkguide. I don’t really need to allocated/destroy new objects on every frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using C++ destructors for Vulkan object cleanup is not very convenient either. You need to wrap everything in custom classes, add move constructors and move &lt;code&gt;operator=&lt;/code&gt;… It adds an additional layer of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases, the cleanup of Vulkan objects happens in one place - and you don’t want to accidentally destroy some in-use object mid-frame by accidentally destroying some wrapper object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also harder to manage lifetimes when you have cleanup in happening in the destructor. For example, suppose you have a case like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct SomeClass {
    SomeOtherClass b;

    void init() {
        ...
    }

    void cleanup() {
        ...
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to cleanup &lt;code&gt;SomeOtherClass&lt;/code&gt; resources (e.g. the instance of &lt;code&gt;SomeOtherClass&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;VkPipeline&lt;/code&gt; object) during &lt;code&gt;SomeClass::cleanup&lt;/code&gt;, you can’t do that if the cleanup of &lt;code&gt;SomeOtherClass&lt;/code&gt; is performed in its destructor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, you can do this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct SomeClass {
    std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;SomeOtherClass&amp;gt; b;

    void init() {
        b = std::make_unique&amp;lt;SomeOtherClass&amp;gt;();
        ...
    }

    void cleanup() {
        b.reset();
        ...
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;… but I don’t like how it introduces a dynamic allocation and requires you to do write more code (and it’s not that much different from calling a &lt;code&gt;cleanup&lt;/code&gt; function manually).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, I prefer to clean up stuff directly, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class SkyboxPipeline {
public:
    void cleanup(VkDevice device) {
        vkDestroyPipeline(device, pipeline, nullptr);
        vkDestroyPipelineLayout(device, pipelineLayout, nullptr);
    }

private:
    VkPipelineLayout pipelineLayout;
    VkPipeline pipeline;
    ...
}

// in GameRenderer.cpp:
void GameRenderer::cleanup(VkDevice device) {
    ...
    skyboxPipeline.cleanup(device);
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach is not perfect - first of all, it’s easy to forget to call &lt;code&gt;cleanup&lt;/code&gt; function, This is not a huge problem since you get a validation error in case you forget to cleanup some Vulkan resources on shutdown:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Validation Error: [ VUID-vkDestroyDevice-device-05137 ] Object 0: handle = 0x4256c1000000005d, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_PIPELINE_LAYOUT; | MessageID = 0x4872eaa0 | vkCreateDevice():  OBJ ERROR : For VkDevice 0x27bd530[], VkPipelineLayout 0x4256c1000000005d[] has not been destroyed. The Vulkan spec states: All child objects created on device must have been destroyed prior to destroying device (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.3.280.1/linux/1.3-extensions/vkspec.html#VUID-vkDestroyDevice-device-05137)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VMA also triggers asserts if you forget to free some buffer/image allocated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find it convenient to have all the Vulkan cleanup happening explicitly in one place. It makes it easy to track when the objects get destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Synchronization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synchronization in Vulkan is difficult. OpenGL and WebGPU do it for you - if you read from some texture/buffer, you know that it will have the correct data and you won’t get problems with data races. With Vulkan, you need to be explicit and this is usually where things tend to get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I manage most of the complexities of sync manually in one place. I separate my drawing into “passes”/pipelines (as described above) and then insert barriers between them. For example, the skinning pass writes new vertex data into GPU memory. Shadow mapping pass reads this data to render skinned meshes into the shadow map. Sync in my code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// do skinning in compute shader
for (const auto&amp;amp; mesh : skinnedMeshes) {
    skinningPass.doSkinning(gfxDevice, mesh);
}

{
    // Sync skinning with CSM
    // This is a "fat" barrier and you can potentially optimize it
    // by specifying all the buffers that the next pass will read from
    const auto memoryBarrier = VkMemoryBarrier2{
        .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MEMORY_BARRIER_2,
        .srcStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_COMPUTE_SHADER_BIT,
        .srcAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_2_SHADER_WRITE_BIT,
        .dstStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_VERTEX_SHADER_BIT,
        .dstAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_2_MEMORY_READ_BIT,
    };
    const auto dependencyInfo = VkDependencyInfo{
        .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEPENDENCY_INFO,
        .memoryBarrierCount = 1,
        .pMemoryBarriers = &amp;amp;memoryBarrier,
    };
    vkCmdPipelineBarrier2(cmd, &amp;amp;dependencyInfo);
}

// do shadow mapping
shadowMappingPass.draw(gfxDevice, ...);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, this can be automated/simplified using render graphs. This is something that I might implement in the future. Right now I’m okay with doing manual sync. vkconfig’s “synchronization” validation layer also helps greatly in finding sync errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following resources were useful for understanding synchronization:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/wiki/Synchronization-Examples&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More implementation notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drawing many sprites&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With bindless textures, it’s easy to draw many sprites using one draw call without having to allocate vertex buffers at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, you can emit vertex coordinates and UVs using &lt;code&gt;gl_VertexIndex&lt;/code&gt; in your vertex shader like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void main()
{
    uint b = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (gl_VertexIndex % 6);
    vec2 baseCoord = vec2((0x1C &amp;amp; b) != 0, (0xE &amp;amp; b) != 0);
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This snippet produces this set of values:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;gl_VertexIndex&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;baseCoord&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(0,0)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(0,1)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(1,1)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(1,1)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(1,0)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(0,0)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the sprite draw calls are combined into &lt;code&gt;SpriteDrawBuffer&lt;/code&gt; which looks like this in GLSL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct SpriteDrawCommand {
    mat4 transform; // could potentially be mat2x2...
    vec2 uv0; // top-left uv coord
    vec2 uv1; // bottom-right uv coord
    vec4 color; // color by which texture is multiplied
    uint textureID; // sprite texture
    uint shaderID; // explained below
    vec2 padding; // padding to satisfy "scalar" requirements
};

layout (buffer_reference, scalar) readonly buffer SpriteDrawBuffer {
    SpriteDrawCommand commands[];
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On CPU/C++ side, it looks almost the same:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct SpriteDrawCommand {
    glm::mat4 transform;
    glm::vec2 uv0; // top-left uv coordinate
    glm::vec2 uv1; // bottom-right uv coodinate
    LinearColor color; // color by which texture is multiplied by
    std::uint32_t textureId; // sprite texture
    std::uint32_t shaderId; // explained below
    glm::vec2 padding; // padding
};

std::vector&amp;lt;SpriteDrawCommand&amp;gt; spriteDrawCommands;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I create two fixed size buffers on the GPU and then upload the contents of &lt;code&gt;spriteDrawCommands&lt;/code&gt; (using techniques described above in the “Handling dynamic data” section).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sprite renderer is used like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// record commands
renderer.beginDrawing();
{
    renderer.drawSprite(sprite, pos);
    renderer.drawText(font, "Hello");
    renderer.drawRect(...);
}
renderer.endDrawing();

// do actual drawing later:
renderer.draw(cmd, gfxDevice, ...);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
  The same renderer also draws text, rectangles and lines in my engine. For example, the text is just N “draw sprite” commands for a string composed of N glyphs. Solid color rectangles and lines are achieved by using a 1x1 pixel white texture and multiplying it by  SpriteCommand::color in the fragment shader.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, here’s how the command to do the drawing looks like inside &lt;code&gt;SpriteRenderer::draw&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;vkCmdDraw(cmd, 6, spriteDrawCommands.size(), 0, 0);
// 6 vertices per instance, spriteDrawCommands.size() instances in total
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complete sprite.vert looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#version 460

#extension GL_GOOGLE_include_directive : require
#extension GL_EXT_buffer_reference : require

#include "sprite_commands.glsl"

layout (push_constant) uniform constants
{
    mat4 viewProj; // 2D camera matrix
    SpriteDrawBuffer drawBuffer; // where sprite draw commands are stored
} pcs;

layout (location = 0) out vec2 outUV;
layout (location = 1) out vec4 outColor;
layout (location = 2) flat out uint textureID;
layout (location = 3) flat out uint shaderID;

void main()
{
    uint b = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (gl_VertexIndex % 6);
    vec2 baseCoord = vec2((0x1C &amp;amp; b) != 0, (0xE &amp;amp; b) != 0);

    SpriteDrawCommand command = pcs.drawBuffer.commands[gl_InstanceIndex];

    gl_Position = pcs.viewProj * command.transform * vec4(baseCoord, 0.f, 1.f);
    outUV = (1.f - baseCoord) * command.uv0 + baseCoord * command.uv1;
    outColor = command.color;
    textureID = command.textureID;
    shaderID = command.shaderID;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the parameters of the sprite draw command are self-explanatory, but &lt;code&gt;shaderID&lt;/code&gt; needs a bit of clarification. Currently, I use it to branch inside the fragment shader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;...

#define SPRITE_SHADER_ID 0
#define TEXT_SHADER_ID   1

void main()
{
    vec4 texColor = sampleTexture2DNearest(textureID, inUV);

    // text drawing is performed differently...
    if (shaderID == TEXT_SHADER_ID) {
        // glyph atlas uses single-channel texture
        texColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, texColor.r);
    }

    if (texColor.a &amp;lt; 0.1) {
        discard;
    }

    outColor = inColor * texColor;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows me to draw sprites differently depending on this ID without having to change pipelines. Of course, it can be potentially bad for the performance. This can be improved by drawing sprites with the same shader ID in batches. You’ll only need to switch pipelines when you encounter a draw command with a different shader ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sprite renderer is very efficient: it can draw 10 thousand sprites in just 315 microseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compute skinning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do skinning for skeletal animation in a compute shader. This allows me to have the same vertex format for all the meshes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, I just take the mesh’s vertices (not skinned) and joint matrices and produce a new buffer of vertices which are used in later rendering stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose you spawn three cats with identical meshes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All three of them can have different animations. They all have an identical “input” mesh. But the “output” vertex buffer will differ between them, which means that you need to pre-allocate a vertex buffer for each instance of the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how the skinning compute shader looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#version 460

#extension GL_GOOGLE_include_directive : require
#extension GL_EXT_buffer_reference : require

#include "vertex.glsl"

struct SkinningDataType {
    ivec4 jointIds;
    vec4 weights;
};

layout (buffer_reference, std430) readonly buffer SkinningData {
    SkinningDataType data[];
};

layout (buffer_reference, std430) readonly buffer JointMatrices {
    mat4 matrices[];
};

layout (push_constant) uniform constants
{
    JointMatrices jointMatrices;
    uint jointMatricesStartIndex;
    uint numVertices;
    VertexBuffer inputBuffer;
    SkinningData skinningData;
    VertexBuffer outputBuffer;
} pcs;

layout (local_size_x = 256, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;

mat4 getJointMatrix(int jointId) {
    return pcs.jointMatrices.matrices[pcs.jointMatricesStartIndex + jointId];
}

void main()
{
    uint index = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;
    if (index &amp;gt;= pcs.numVertices) {
        return;
    }

    SkinningDataType sd = pcs.skinningData.data[index];
    mat4 skinMatrix =
        sd.weights.x * getJointMatrix(sd.jointIds.x) +
        sd.weights.y * getJointMatrix(sd.jointIds.y) +
        sd.weights.z * getJointMatrix(sd.jointIds.z) +
        sd.weights.w * getJointMatrix(sd.jointIds.w);

    Vertex v = pcs.inputBuffer.vertices[index];
    v.position = vec3(skinMatrix * vec4(v.position, 1.0));

    pcs.outputBuffer.vertices[index] = v;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I store all joint matrices in a big array and populate it every frame (and also pass the starting index in the array for each skinned mesh, &lt;code&gt;jointMatricesStartIndex&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Skinning data is not stored inside each mesh vertex, a separate buffer of &lt;code&gt;num_vertices&lt;/code&gt;elements is used.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the skinning is performed, all the later rendering stages use this set of vertices Thee rendering process for static and skinned meshes becomes identical, thanks to that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Anton’s OpenGL 4 Tutorials book has the best skinning implementation guide I’ve ever read. Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory has nice explanations about skinning/skeletal animation math as well.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Game / renderer separation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a game/renderer separation which uses a simple concept of “draw commands”. In the game logic, I use entt, but the renderer doesn’t know anything about entities or “game objects”. It only knows about the lights, some scene parameters (like fog, which skybox texture to use etc) and meshes it needs to draw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The renderer’s API looks like this in action:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void Game::generateDrawList()
{
    renderer.beginDrawing();

    // Add lights
    const auto lights = ...; // get list of all active lights
    for (const auto&amp;amp;&amp;amp; [e, tc, lc] : lights.each()) {
        renderer.addLight(lc.light, tc.transform);
    }

    // Render static meshes
    const auto staticMeshes = ...; // list of entities with static meshes
    for (const auto&amp;amp;&amp;amp; [e, tc, mc] : staticMeshes.each()) {
        // Each "mesh" can have multiple submeshes similar to how
        // glTF separates each "mesh" into "primitives".
        for (std::size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; mc.meshes.size(); ++i) {
            renderer.drawMesh(mc.meshes[i], tc.worldTransform, mc.castShadow);
        }
    }

    // Render meshes with skeletal animation
    const auto skinnedMeshes = ...; // list of entities with skeletal animations
    for (const auto&amp;amp;&amp;amp; [e, tc, mc, sc] : skinnedMeshes.each()) {
        renderer.drawSkinnedMesh(
            mc.meshes, sc.skinnedMeshes, tc.worldTransform,
            sc.skeletonAnimator.getJointMatrices());
    }

    renderer.endDrawing();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you call &lt;code&gt;drawMesh&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;drawSkinnedMesh&lt;/code&gt;, the renderer creates a mesh draw command and puts it in &lt;code&gt;std::vector&amp;lt;MeshDrawCommand&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which are then iterated through during the drawing process. The &lt;code&gt;MeshDrawCommand&lt;/code&gt; looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
struct SkinnedMesh {
    GPUBuffer skinnedVertexBuffer;
};

struct MeshDrawCommand {
    MeshId meshId;
    glm::mat4 transformMatrix;
    math::Sphere worldBoundingSphere;

    const SkinnedMesh* skinnedMesh{nullptr};
    std::uint32_t jointMatricesStartIndex;
    bool castShadow{true};
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;meshId&lt;/code&gt;is used for looking up static meshes in&lt;code&gt;MeshCache&lt;/code&gt;- it’s a simple&lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;of references to vertex buffers on GPU.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the mesh has a skeleton, &lt;code&gt;jointMatricesStartIndex&lt;/code&gt;is used during compute skinning and&lt;code&gt;skinnedMesh-&amp;gt;skinnedVertexBuffer&lt;/code&gt;is used for all the rendering afterwards (instead of&lt;code&gt;meshId&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;worldBoundingSphere&lt;/code&gt;is used for frustum culling.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This separation is nice because the renderer is clearly separated from the game logic. You can also do something more clever as described here if sorting draw commands becomes a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Scene loading and entity prefabs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Blender as a level editor and export it as glTF. It’s easy to place objects, colliders and lights there. Here’s how it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing your own level editor would probably take months (years!), so using Blender instead saved me quite a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s important to mention how I use node names for spawning some objects. For example, you can see an object named &lt;code&gt;Interact.Sphere.Diary&lt;/code&gt; selected in the screenshot above. The part before the first dot is the prefab name (in this case “Interact”). The “Sphere” part is used by the physics system to create a sphere physics body for the object (“Capsule” and “Box” can also be used, otherwise the physics shape is created using mesh vertices).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some models are pretty complex and I don’t want to place them directly into the level glTF file as it’ll greatly increase each level’s size. I just place an “Empty-&amp;gt;Arrows” object and name it something like “Cat.NearStore”. This will spawn “Cat” prefab and attach “NearStore” tag to it for runtime identification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prefabs are written in JSON and look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "scene": {
    "scene": "assets/models/cato.gltf"
  },
  "movement": {
    "maxSpeed": [4, 4, 4]
  },
  "physics": {
    "type": "dynamic",
    "bodyType": "virtual_character",
    "bodyParams": {
        ...
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the level loading process, if the node doesn’t have a corresponding prefab, it’s loaded as-is and its mesh data is taken from the glTF file itself (this is mostly used for static geometry). If the node has a corresponding prefab loaded, it’s created instead. Its mesh data is loaded from the external glTF file - only transform is copied from the original glTF node (the one in the level glTF file).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Once glTFX is released and the support for it is added to Blender, things might be even easier to handle as you’ll be able to reference external glTF files with it.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;MSAA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using forward rendering allowed me to easily implement MSAA. Here’s a comparison of how the game looks without AA and with MSAA on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MSAA is explained well here: https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Multisampling&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s another good article about MSAA: https://therealmjp.github.io/posts/msaa-overview/ and potential problems you can have with it (especially with HDR and tone-mapping).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;UI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My UI system was inspired by Roblox’s UI API: https://create.roblox.com/docs/ui&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, the UI can calculate its own layout without me having to hard code each individual element’s size and position. Basically it relies on the following concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Origin is an anchor around which the UI element is positioned. If origin is &lt;code&gt;(0, 0)&lt;/code&gt;, setting UI element’s position to be&lt;code&gt;(x,y)&lt;/code&gt;will make its upper-left pixel have (x,y) pixel coordinate. If the origin is&lt;code&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/code&gt;, then the element’s bottom-right corner will be positioned at&lt;code&gt;(x, y)&lt;/code&gt;. If the origin is (0.5, 1) then it will be positioned using bottom-center point as the reference.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relative size makes the children’s be proportional to parent’s size. If (1,1) then the child element will have the same size as the parent element. If it’s (0.5, 0.5) then it’ll have half the size of the parent. If the parent uses children’s size as a guide, then if a child has (0.5, 0.25) relative size, the parent’s width will be 2x larger and the height will be 4x larger.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relative position uses parent’s size as a guide for positioning. It’s useful for centering elements, for example if you have an element with (0.5, 0.5) origin and (0.5, 0.5) relative position, it’ll be centered inside its parent element.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can also set pixel offsets for both position and size separately (they’re called &lt;code&gt;offsetPosition&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;offsetSize&lt;/code&gt;in my codebase).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can also set a fixed size for the elements if you don’t want them to ever be resized.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The label/image element size is determined using its content.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how it can be used to position child elements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a) The child (yellow) has relative size (0.5, 1), relative position of (0.5, 0.5) and origin (0.5, 0.5) (alternatively, the relative position can be (0.5, 0.0) and origin at (0.5, 0.0) in this case). Its parent (green) will be two times wider, but will have the same height. The child element will be centered inside the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b) The child (yellow) has origin (1, 1), fixed size (w,h) and absolute offset of (x,y) - this way, the item can be positioned relative to the bottom-right corner of its parent (green)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see how sizes and positions of UI elements are calculated (implementation in EDBR).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, sizes of all elements are calculated recursively. Then positions are computed based on the previously computed sizes and specified offset positions. Afterwards all elements are drawn recursively - parent element first, then its children etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When calculating the size, most elements either have a “fixed” size (which you can set manually, e.g. you can set some button to always be 60x60 pixels) or their size is computed based on their content. For example, for label elements, their size is computed using the text’s bounding box. For image elements, their size equals the image size and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If an element has an “Auto-size” property, it needs to specify which child will be used to calculate its size. For example, the menu nine-slice can have several text labels inside the “vertical layout” element - the bounding boxes will be calculated first, then their sizes will be summed up - then, the parent’s size is calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at a simple menu with bounding boxes displayed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, root &lt;code&gt;NineSliceElement&lt;/code&gt; is marked as “Auto-size”. To compute its size, it first computes the size of its child (&lt;code&gt;ListLayoutElement&lt;/code&gt;). This recursively computes the sizes of each button, sums them up and adds some padding (&lt;code&gt;ListLayoutElement&lt;/code&gt; also makes the width of each button the same based on the maximum width in the list).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Dear ImGui and sRGB issues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love Dear ImGui. I used it to implement many useful dev and debug tools (open the image in a new tab to see them better):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has some problems with sRGB, though. I won’t explain it in detail, but basically if you use sRGB framebuffer, Dear ImGui will look wrong in many ways, see the comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can see people doing hacks by doing &lt;code&gt;pow(col, vec4(2.2))&lt;/code&gt; with Dear ImGui’s colors but it still doesn’t work properly with alpha and produces incorrect color pickers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up writing my own Dear ImGui backend and implementing DilligentEngine’s workaround which is explained in detail here and here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Writing it wasn’t as hard as I expected. I only need to write the rendering part, while “logic/OS interaction” part (input event processing, clipboard etc.) is still handled by default Dear ImGui SDL backend in my case.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some additional benefits of having my own backend:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It supports bindless texture ids, so I can draw images by simply calling &lt;code&gt;ImGui::Image(bindlessTextureId, ...)&lt;/code&gt;. Dear ImGui’s Vulkan backend requires you to “register” textures by calling&lt;code&gt;ImGui_ImplVulkan_AddTexture&lt;/code&gt;for each texture before you can call&lt;code&gt;ImGui::Image&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It can properly draw linear and non-linear images by passing their format into backend (so that sRGB images are not gamma corrected twice when they’re displayed)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Initializing and dealing with it is easier as it does Vulkan things in the same way as the rest of my engine.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Other stuff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many parts of the engine not covered there because they’re not related to Vulkan. I still feel like it’s good to mention them briefly for the sake of completion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I use Jolt Physics for physics.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrating it into the engine was pretty easy. Right now I mostly use it for collision resolution and basic character movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The samples are fantastic. The docs are very good too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I especially want to point out how incredible &lt;code&gt;JPH::CharacterVirtual&lt;/code&gt; is. It handles basic character movement so well. I remember spending days trying to get proper slope movement in Bullet to work. With Jolt, it just worked “out of the box”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it basically works (explaining how it works properly would probably require me to write quite a big article):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You add your shapes to Jolt’s world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You run the simulation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You get new positions of your physics objects and use these positions to render objects in their current positions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I use entt for the entity-component-system part.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has worked great for me so far. Previously I had my own ECS implementation, but decided to experiment with a 3rd party ECS library to have less code to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I use openal-soft, libogg and libvorbis for audio.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The audio system is mostly based on these articles: https://indiegamedev.net/2020/02/15/the-complete-guide-to-openal-with-c-part-1-playing-a-sound/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I use Tracy for profiling.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrating it was very easy (read the PDF doc, it’s fantastic!) and it helped me avoid tons of bike-shedding by seeing how little time something, which I thought was “inefficient”, really took.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I gained from switching to Vulkan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many nice things I got after switching to Vulkan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No more global state&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes abstractions a lot easier. With OpenGL abstractions/engines, you frequently see “shader.bind()” calls, state trackers, magic RAII, which automatically binds/unbinds objects and so on. There’s no need for that in Vulkan - it’s easy to write functions which take some objects as an input and produce some output - stateless, more explicit and easier to reason about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;API is more pleasant to work with overall - I didn’t like “binding” things and the whole “global state machine” of OpenGL.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to write less abstractions overall.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With OpenGL, you need to write a lot of abstractions to make it all less error-prone… Vulkan’s API requires a lot less of this, in my experience. And usually the abstractions that you write map closer to Vulkan’s “raw” functions, compared to OpenGL abstractions which hide manipulation of global state and usually call several functions (and might do some stateful things for optimization).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better validation errors&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Validation errors are very good in Vulkan. While OpenGL has &lt;code&gt;glDebugMessageCallback&lt;/code&gt;, it doesn’t catch that many issues and you’re left wondering why your texture looks weird, why your lighting is broken and so on. Vulkan has more extensive validation which makes the debugging process much better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debugging in RenderDoc&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can now debug shaders in RenderDoc. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With OpenGL I had to output the values to some texture and color-pick them… which took a lot of time. But now I can debug vertex and fragment shaders easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More consistent experience across different GPUs and OSes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With OpenGL, drivers on different GPUs and OSes worked differently from each other which made some bugs pop up only on certain hardware configurations. It made the process of debugging them hard. I still experienced some slight differences between different GPUs in Vulkan, but it’s much less prevalent compared to OpenGL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ability to use better shading languages in the future&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GLSL is a fine shading language, but there are some new shading languages which promise to be more feature-complete, convenient and readable, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I might explore them in the future and see if they offer me something that GLSL lacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More control over every aspect of the graphics pipeline.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Second system effect, but good&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first OpenGL engine was written during the process of learning graphics programming from scratch. Many abstractions were not that good and rewriting them with some graphics programming knowledge (and some help from vkguide) helped me implement a much cleaner system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Street cred&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, it makes me proud to be able to say “I have a custom engine written in Vulkan and it works”. Sometimes people start thinking about you as a coding wizard and it makes me happy and proud of my work. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many things that I plan to do in the future, here’s a list of some of them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sign-distance field font support (good article about implementing them)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Loading many images and generating mipmaps in parallel (or use image formats which already have mipmaps stored inside of them)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bloom.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Volumetric fog.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Animation blending.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Render graphs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ambient occlusion.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finishing the game? (hopefully…)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, I’m quite satisfied with what I managed to accomplish. Learning Vulkan was quite difficult, but it wasn’t as hard as I imagined. It taught me a lot about graphics programming and modern APIs and now I have a strong foundation to build my games with.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LXD provides native support for KVM/libvirt, making it ideal for running VMs inside containers without privileged mode or complex workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Native KVM device access - no &lt;code&gt;--privileged&lt;/code&gt;mode needed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Full systemd support inside containers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Designed for nested virtualization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ YAML-based configuration (lxd-compose)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Better security isolation for VM workloads&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Minimal performance overhead (~5%)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infinibay's LXD deployment supports multiple Linux distributions with automatic package manager detection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debian/Ubuntu - Uses &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;(auto-detected)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/Rocky/AlmaLinux - Uses &lt;code&gt;dnf&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;yum&lt;/code&gt;(auto-detected)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;openSUSE/SLES - Uses &lt;code&gt;zypper&lt;/code&gt;(auto-detected)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arch/Manjaro/EndeavourOS - Uses &lt;code&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt;(auto-detected)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup script automatically detects your distribution and uses the appropriate package manager. LXD installation path (snap vs native package) is also auto-detected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This directory contains LXD-based containerization for Infinibay using lxd-compose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lxd/
├── run.sh                         # Main management script ⭐
├── .lxd-compose.yml               # Main lxd-compose config
├── envs/
│   └── infinibay.yml              # Infinibay project definition
├── profiles/

└── README.md                      # This file
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: lxd-compose uses a different structure than docker-compose:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Main config: &lt;code&gt;.lxd-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Projects: &lt;code&gt;envs/*.yml&lt;/code&gt;files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commands: &lt;code&gt;apply infinibay&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;destroy infinibay&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;stop infinibay&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deployment creates 4 LXD containers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;infinibay-postgres - PostgreSQL database&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;infinibay-redis - Redis cache&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;infinibay-backend - Node.js API + libvirt-node + infiniservice + KVM access&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;infinibay-frontend - Next.js web interface&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 1. Clone repository and navigate to lxd directory
cd infinibay/lxd

# 2. Run setup (installs LXD, lxd-compose, detects package manager)
sudo ./setup.sh

# 3. IMPORTANT: Activate lxd group (REQUIRED!)
newgrp lxd
# This activates the group in your current session
# You need to do this after setup.sh adds you to the lxd group

# 4. Configure environment variables
# Option A: Edit the auto-generated .env (RECOMMENDED)
nano .env
# setup.sh already created .env with secure auto-generated passwords
# IMPORTANT: Change ADMIN_PASSWORD from auto-generated to your own!

# Option B: If you prefer to start from .env.example before setup.sh
# cp .env.example .env &amp;amp;&amp;amp; nano .env
# Then run setup.sh, which will detect and preserve your .env

# 5. Deploy and start Infinibay (smart default - does everything!)
./run.sh
# This one command:
# - Creates containers if they don't exist
# - Starts containers if they're stopped
# - Provisions if not already done (installs PostgreSQL, Redis, Node.js, Rust, libvirt)
# - Shows access URLs when ready
# Takes 5-10 minutes on first run

# 6. Access Infinibay
# URLs will be displayed after ./run.sh completes
# Frontend: http://&amp;lt;frontend-ip&amp;gt;:3000
# Backend API: http://&amp;lt;backend-ip&amp;gt;:4000&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;setup.sh&lt;/code&gt;- Installs LXD, lxd-compose, detects your distro and package manager, auto-detects LXD path, generates&lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;with secure passwords&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;newgrp lxd&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;REQUIRED - Activates lxd group permissions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;.env configuration&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;IMPORTANT - Review and change ADMIN_PASSWORD (auto-generated passwords should be personalized!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;./run.sh&lt;/code&gt;- Intelligent orchestration: creates containers, provisions software, starts everything&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Checks if environment exists → creates if not&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Checks if containers are running → starts if stopped&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Checks if provisioned → provisions if not (tracked via LXD metadata)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Skips already-completed steps automatically&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Containers have shared &lt;code&gt;/opt/infinibay&lt;/code&gt;directory (your code)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data persists in &lt;code&gt;/data&lt;/code&gt;directories even if containers are destroyed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After running &lt;code&gt;setup.sh&lt;/code&gt;, you may need to activate the &lt;code&gt;lxd&lt;/code&gt; group:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Option 1 (Quick - current session only):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;newgrp lxd&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Option 2 (Permanent - requires re-login):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;logout
# Then login again&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to check if you're in the group:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;groups | grep lxd
# Should show 'lxd' in the output&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# One command does everything - creates, provisions, and starts
./run.sh              # Smart default - handles everything automatically

# Fresh start - destroy and recreate everything
./run.sh redo         # or: ./run.sh rd

# Quick status check
./run.sh status       # or: ./run.sh s&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Smart default workflow (recommended)
./run.sh              # Does everything: create → provision → start

# Manual step-by-step (if you prefer explicit control)
./run.sh apply        # Shortcuts: a, ap - Create containers

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mosses are already known for coping with harsh radiation, dehydration, and long freezes. Now scientists have pushed them even further by exposing their spore capsules to open space for nine months, and most of them survived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team worked with spreading earthmoss (Physcomitrium patens), a small moss species used widely as a plant model by researchers. Its spore-containing capsules were mounted on the outside of the International Space Station (ISS), where they experienced direct solar radiation, vacuum conditions, and sharp temperature swings during each orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under those conditions, cells usually break down quickly. So the researchers were surprised by what came back. “We expected almost zero survival, but the result was the opposite,” says Hokkaido University biologist Tomomichi Fujita. More than 80 percent of the spores still germinated once they returned to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also Read: Microbe That Could Turn Martian Dust into Oxygen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team detected a small drop in chlorophyll a, but the other pigments remained stable. The spores grew normally in follow-up tests, showing no signs of major stress from their time in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of toughness fits with the evolutionary history of mosses. Bryophytes — the group that includes mosses, liverworts, and hornworts — were among the first plants to move from water onto land about 500 million years ago. Their spores had to withstand drying and direct sunlight long before soils existed, which may explain why their protective structures still hold up so well today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results place moss spores alongside the few organisms known to tolerate direct space exposure, including tardigrades and certain microbes. Their survival also adds to ongoing discussions about what types of life might endure extreme environments beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this durability could matter for future experiments on the Moon or Mars. Mosses need very little soil and can pull nutrients directly from rock, making them candidates for early ecosystem tests in extraterrestrial settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, we hope this work opens a new frontier toward constructing ecosystems in extraterrestrial environments such as the Moon and Mars,” says Fujita. “I hope that our moss research will serve as a starting point.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research was published in iScience. Read the study here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;openring-rs&lt;/code&gt; is a tool for generating a webring from Atom/RSS feeds, so you can populate a template with articles from those feeds and embed them in your own blog. An example template is provided in &lt;code&gt;in.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a Rust-port of Drew DeVault's openring, with the primary differences being:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Superman copy found in mum's attic is most valuable comic ever at $9.12m&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While cleaning out their late mother's California attic last Christmas, three brothers made a life-changing discovery under a pile of faded newspapers: one of the first Superman comics ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An original copy of the June 1939 first edition on the Man of Steel's adventures, it was in a remarkably pristine condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it has become the highest-priced comic book ever sold, fetching $9.12m (£7m) at auction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Texas-based Heritage Auctions, which hosted Thursday's sale, called it the "pinnacle of comic collecting".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brothers found six comic books, including Superman #1, in the attic underneath a stack of newspapers inside a cardboard box and surrounded by cobwebs in 2024, Heritage said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They waited a few months before contacting the auction house, but once they did, Heritage Auctions vice-president Lon Allen visited them in San Francisco within days, according to the auction house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brothers, who have chosen to withhold their names, are "in their 50s and 60s, and their mom had always told them she had an expensive comics collection but never showed them", Mr Allen said in Heritage's press release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's a twist on the old 'Mom threw away my comics' story."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their mother had held on to the comic books since she and her brother bought them between the Great Depression and the beginning of World War Two, Heritage said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr Allen added that the cool northern California climate was perfect for preserving old paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"If it had been in an attic here in Texas, it would have been ruined," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That helped CGC, a large third-party comics grading service, give this copy of Superman #1 a 9.0 rating on a 10-point scale, topping the previous record of 8.5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And at its sale price of over $9m, including buyer's premium, Superman #1 easily beat the previous highest-priced comic book ever sold by $3m.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action Comics No. 1, the 1938 work that first introduced Superman, sold for $6m last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The youngest brother said in Heritage's press release that the box had remained forgotten in the back of attic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"As the years unfolded, life brought about a series of losses and changes," he said. "The demands of everyday survival took centre stage, and the box of comics, once set aside with care and intention, was forgotten. Until last Christmas."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He added: "This isn't simply a story about old paper and ink. This was never just about a collectible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This is a testament to memory, family and the unexpected ways the past finds its way back to us."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
