  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Adafruit: Arduino’s Rules Are ‘Incompatible With Open Source’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The open source hardware community is debating Arduino’s new Terms and Conditions following the company’s acquisition by Qualcomm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chief microcontroller rival Adafruit has argued that the new terms threaten open principles by restricting reverse engineering of cloud tools, asserting perpetual licenses over user uploads and implementing broad monitoring for AI-related features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino has defended the changes, claiming restrictions only apply to its SaaS cloud applications, that data handling is standard for modern platforms, and its commitment to open source hardware remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Debate Over Arduino’s New Terms and Conditions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, I spoke to Arduino, Adafruit and the EFF about Qualcomm’s October acquisition of the beloved company known for its single-board microcontroller kits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many criticisms came from rival Adafruit, whose products include Arduino-compatible hardware kits. In late November, Adafruit’s Managing Editor Phillip Torrone had warned its 36,000+ followers on LinkedIn that (among other things) Arduino’s users were now “explicitly forbidden from reverse engineering or even attempting to understand how the platform works unless Arduino gives permission.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Arduino responded in a blog post that “Restrictions on reverse engineering apply specifically to our Software-as-a-Service cloud applications. Anything that was open, stays open.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Arduino spokesperson said their blog post reassured many readers, who’d said they felt “understanding and relief that our commitment to the open source spirit is unwavering and Arduino’s core mission remains unchanged.” Yet Adafruit’s critical LinkedIn post had drawn over 1,575 upvotes. I asked both sides to clarify their positions. Does this really represent a turning point since Arduino’s founding in 2004?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what they had to say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reverse Engineering: Cloud Apps vs. Hardware Boards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked Mitch Stoltz, EFF director for competition and IP litigation, who agreed that Arduino “isn’t imposing any new bans on tinkering with or reverse engineering Arduino boards.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Adafruit, Arduino’s primary user base is at-home enthusiasts. Arduino provides an open source electronics platform — which includes single-board microcontrollers such as the Arduino UNO — and various kits/shields/accessories, as well as development software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Adafruit founder Limor “Ladyada” Fried says Arduino’s response “downplays how central the cloud and web tools have become to the Arduino experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you go to the Arduino software page and the cloud page, you’re strongly encouraged to use the cloud editor/web IDE and cloud plans, especially on platforms like ChromeOS where the cloud editor is the recommended or only realistic path,” Fried said. “So when Arduino says ‘These restrictions only apply to SaaS,’ that still means the restrictions apply to the tools many new users are being steered into as their primary Arduino environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“On top of that, using those cloud tools generally requires an Arduino account, and the signup flow prominently presents marketing and profiling consents, including consent to processing personal data for commercial offers and to profiling for customized offers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That is a very different model than ‘download a local IDE and just start hacking on hardware,'” Fried said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Even if the underlying firmware and libraries remain open source, the practical entry point for many users is moving”, she pointed out, in that accounts are tied to personal data, marketing and profiling prompts have been introduced, and are being linked to centralized, subscription-oriented cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Understanding the License on User-Uploaded Content&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adafruit’s Torrone had also said Arduino’s new documents “introduce an irrevocable, perpetual license over anything users upload.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Arduino argues they’re instead clarifying that “content you choose to publish on the Arduino platform remains yours, and can be used to enable features you’ve requested, such as cloud services and collaboration tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up interview, an Arduino spokesperson provided clarifying examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“If a user uploads their code sketches on their Arduino Cloud subscription, the content remains their own, private to them, and the licensing rights granted to Arduino are strictly functional to perform the requested features (e.g. compiling the sketch in the cloud).”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“If the user uploads code or content to Project Hub or to the Forum, where the content is visible to all other users, then Arduino requires the user, who retains the ownership of the content, to grant a license to handle the publication.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“[W]ithout this license, we could not run user projects on the cloud or display their posts in the forum, which is why this type of license is typically required to run any modern cloud service or social platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino’s old terms of use had also required a license for using material posted, notes EFF’s Stoltz, which he says is “normal for any online platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then Stoltz adds that “Still, some of the changes to the terms are troubling.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino’s old terms “were unusual in giving users the ability to revoke that license at any time. The new terms remove that ability, making the license irrevocable. It’s disappointing to see a platform that was once especially user-protective revert to the norm.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;User Data and the Right To Delete Accounts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino also pointed out an additional privacy protection. “All users retain the right to request deletion of their account and/or content at any time. Upon such deletion, the relevant content will no longer be visible to other users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Torrone had complained of “years-long retention of usernames even after account deletion,” but Arduino calls that “a misunderstanding of our policy … When a user requests account deletion, we immediately delete the account and remove the user’s username from all associated Forum posts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The five-year public retention of usernames applies only to users who simply have not logged into their Arduino user account for 24 months and have not submitted any data or account deletion requests.” (In those cases, Arduino seeks a status where “contributions remain attributed to inactive usernames, honoring their contribution to the community.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for those inactive-for-two-years users, accounts are automatically deactivated, Arduino’s blog post clarified, but with usernames preserved in the Arduino Forum “to address an explicit request from the Forum community to maintain attribution for user-generated content.” (And where a user does request account deletion, “the username would be promptly removed and related posts would become anonymous.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even then, with those inactive accounts, “After five years the username is deleted,” Arduino’s spokesperson explained, “and relevant user posts or comments are de-identified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This policy is not meant for data retention for commercial use, but instead solely to help preserve content attribution, something the community has emphasized as valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Adafruit’s Fried still says there’s a troubling pattern in how usernames are retained and not deleted. “Policy choices that treat the community’s identity and data as a managed asset, rather than something users can fully control.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI Features and User Monitoring Policies on Arduino&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The culture difference is most clear where the new Terms and Conditions list several “prohibited uses of AI,” which include criminal use and violation of the law, intentions to harm (including dissemination of false information and manipulative or deceptive acts), generating facial recognition databases and military use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino’s blog post notes its new AI features are optional — including AI-powered computer vision and audio models and an IDE with pre-trained AI models. But in the new Terms and Conditions, Arduino “reserves the right to monitor User accounts and use of the AI Product … [for] verifying compliance with laws and this policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino says the monitoring is “to comply with existing laws and regulations, including applicable privacy laws, export controls, and other global regulatory requirements” and “verify compliance with legal and policy standards.” And they add their ultimate goal is “protecting the users and Arduino” and to enable “robust and reliable operation of the AI products.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But their conditions also include the right to monitor for other reasons, including “administering and managing Arduino’s business.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adafruit’s Fried says Arduino “should, of course, comply with applicable laws and respond appropriately to clear evidence of criminal activity.” But “they should design their AI and cloud offerings so that monitoring is narrowly targeted, proportionate, and clearly explained, instead of defaulting to broad surveillance across all users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“You cannot say ‘this code is open source, but it may not be used for military purposes’ and still call the license open source.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;— Adafruit Founder Limor Fried&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fried instead sees “an ongoing surveillance posture, not just responding to specific, well-founded reports of abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes, an open source application can watch for the creation of facial-recognition databases or military use “as long as they are transparent about what they log, how long they keep it, and under what circumstances they review it.” But there are concerns about “broad continuous monitoring erodes user trust, especially in an educational/maker context where many people are minors or hobbyists who expect a relatively private environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there’s an even larger issue of principle. “Genuine open source licenses do not allow field-of-use restrictions,” Fried said. “You cannot say ‘this code is open source, but it may not be used for military purposes’ and still call the license open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you present something as open source, you no longer get to pick and choose ‘good’ versus ‘bad’ users.” Fried calls such restrictions “fundamentally incompatible with open source licensing,” and would like to see Arduino remove them. “If a project wants that kind of control, it should be honest and call itself ‘source-available’ or something similar, not open source.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Torrone noted that Arduino’s Terms and Conditions also state users will undertake not to use Arduino’s platform or services “to identify or provide evidence to support any potential patent infringement claim against Arduino … or any of Arduino’s or Arduino’s Affiliates’ suppliers and/or direct or indirect customers.” But the specifics almost seem beside the point. Fried says Arduino’s usage restrictions “effectively override the freedoms the license is supposed to guarantee.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s Next for Arduino and the Open Source Community?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Transparency and open dialogue are fundamental to the Arduino ethos,” its spokesperson said Friday, “and understanding the community’s concerns, we are eager to set the record straight and reaffirm our commitment to the open source community.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The representative also added that “We are committed to continuing to listen to community feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what will Adafruit do next? Fried said Friday that Adafruit isn’t changing, and would “keep designing and shipping open source hardware, with hardware, firmware, and software available so people can learn from it, modify it, and build on it.” And the company supports “multiple” ecosystems, also continuing work on Wi-Fi/Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) chips, matter-based Internet of Things (IoT), and the Linux Foundation’s real-time OS Zephyr.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are always open to working with other makers and companies, including Arduino, as long as the collaboration allows us to ship great products with strong documentation and truly open source licensing.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;JSDoc *is* TypeScript&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In May of 2023 an internal refactoring PR from the Svelte repo made it to the front page of the Hacker News forums. The (superficially) controversial PR seemingly vindicated TypeScript skeptics/luddites (which at the time included figures like Dan Abramov of the React team). The premier darling of web frameworks ostensibly rejecting the benefits of static typing was a big deal.1 So Rich Harris felt compelled to hop onto HN and explain how this was "not a vindication of anti-Typescript positions".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harris offered a considered take on why moving type declarations from .ts files to JSDoc comments in .js files was not an anti-TypeScript take. In fact, Harris asserted that Svelte's "commitment to TypeScript [was] stronger than ever."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This event heralded (and served as a citation for) a flood of "TypeScript VS JSDoc" blog posts and forum threads that offered the somewhat novel defense of JSDoc as "all the benefits of TypeScript without the build step" (albeit with a sometimes clunkier syntax).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is not the blog post lineage I hope to draw on with this post. Instead, I'd like to focus on a larger and more often misunderstood point. I take issue with the "vs" framing and offer a subtle but crucial substitution: JSDoc is TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some background:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TypeScript is C#?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the late aughts/early 10s, JavaScript was still mostly seen as an unserious language. The tooling for JavaScript development lacked autocomplete, rename symbol, type safety, etc. Microsoft developers were so allergic to it that they would write C# code and use a tool called ScriptSharp to generate slightly-more-typesafe JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the origins of TypeScript.2 It is, fundamentally, a build tool to make writing JS less crappy. In fact:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TypeScript is IntelliSense!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you don't write your code in .ts files, you're probably using TypeScript. That's because TypeScript is the IntelliSense engine. Even if you're not using VSCode, if your editor gives you code completion, parameter info, quick info, member lists, etc. while writing JS code, you are almost certainly running the TypeScript language service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TypeScript is JSDoc :)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also the TypeScript language service that is used to interpret JSDoc comments. That is why the TypeScript CHANGELOG often includes notes about JSDoc features.3 It also the reason your JSDoc-related IntelliSense can be governed by a &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; file and you can run &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt; on a project typed with JSDoc comments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are already using TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Own Experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently rewrote the front-end for an old project of mine completely typed with JSDoc comments and I wanted to share some of my takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Besides runtime features like enums, basically everything you can express in TypeScript you can express in JSDoc. Certain features like generics are much clunkier, forcing you to type the return in order to infer generic slots. But sometimes the clunkier syntax can actually encourage better TypeScript practices by pushing devs to rely more on type inference.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For packages typed with JSDoc, CTRL/CMD clicking on a function will take you to actual code rather than a type declarations file. I much prefer this experience as a dev.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TypeScript tooling is surprisingly reusable for JSDoc projects. This includes type generation libraries that take schemas (e.g. OpenApi or GraphQL) defined in your backend and generate corresponding types in your front-end. I found that most of these can be set up to generate types in JSDoc comments instead of TypeScript code.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take it from a massive TypeScript nerd: JSDoc is not an anti-TypeScript position to take. It is the same powerful static analysis without the build step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EDIT: This got some discussion on HN and I've learned that webpack has also migrated to JSDoc↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And the reason enums were, regrettably, added to the language↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A miserable sidenote: becoming a TypeScript expert means accepting that half of the TypeScript documentation is in the changelog. E.g.↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Richard P. Feynman&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The Problem of Teaching Physics in Latin America" is a transcript of the keynote speech given by Richard Feynman at the First Inter‑American Conference on Physics Education in Rio de Janeiro in June 1963. Dr. Feynman is Richard Chace Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem of teaching physics in Latin America is only part of the wider problem of teaching physics anywhere. In fact, it is part of the problem of teaching anything anywhere – a problem for which there is no known satisfactory solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many new plans in many countries for trying to teach physics, which shows that nobody is satisfied with any method. It is likely that many of the new plans look good, for nobody has tried them long enough to find out what is the matter with them; whereas all the old methods have been with us long enough to show their faults clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact is that nobody knows very well how to tell anybody else how to teach. So when we try to figure out how to teach physics we must he somewhat modest, because nobody really knows how. It is at the same time a serious problem and an opportunity for new discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem of teaching physics in Latin America can also be generalized in another way, to remind us of the problem of doing anything in Latin America. We must get at least partly involved in the special social, political, and economic problems that exist here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the problems come into sharper focus if there is before us a clear picture of the reasons for teaching physics in the first place. So I will try to give some reasons why I believe we should teach physics. We can then ask whether any particular educational plan is in fact satisfying any of the reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first reason is, of course, that physics is a basic science, and as such is used in engineering, chemistry, and biology, and has all kinds of applications in technology. Physics is the science, or knowledge of nature, that tells us how things work. In particular, I am stressing here how devices of various kinds – invented by men in present and forthcoming technology – work. Therefore, those who know physics will be much more useful in coping with the technical problems arising in local industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be argued, and in practice it is argued, that in the earlier stages of industrial development that we have in Latin America, such talent is completely superfluous because it is so easy to import good technically‑trained personnel from more advanced countries outside. Therefore, is it really necessary to develop highly‑technically‑trained people locally?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I probably do not know enough economics to answer correctly, but I will try to give an opinion anyway. I think it is vitally important to improve the technical ability of the peoples of Latin America. By education, the man with higher technical ability is able to produce more, and I believe that in the improvement of the technical ability, and thus the productivity, of the people of Latin America lies the source of real economic advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not economically sound to continuously import technically‑skilled people. If Latin American people were educated technically they would find positions in the developing industries here; it would soon be realized by the people who now import such workers that there is a supply of really able men in this country, and that this local supply has many advantages. The local people would not demand such high wages, would know the customs and ways of the country, and would be glad to take more permanent positions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is true that Latin Americans with the same degrees in science or engineering as their foreign counterparts seem to be very much less able. This (as I shall explain) is because they have not really been taught any science. This experience has probably conditioned industrialists to pay very little attention to the local universities and scientists. If they were wise the industrialists would see the problem quite the other way around and would be the first to clamor for a meeting of the kind we are having today, to find out what is the matter with the local product and how to teach physics in a really satisfactory manner in their countries. Yet none of them are here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A secondary reason for teaching physics, or any experimental science, is that it incidentally teaches how to do things with your hands. It teaches many techniques for manipulating things – as well as techniques of measurement and calculation, for example – which have very much wider applications than the particular field of study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another major reason for teaching physics is for the science itself. Science is an activity of men; to many men it is a great pleasure and it should not be denied to the people of a large part of the world simply because of a fault or lack in the educational system. In other words, one of the reasons for teaching science is to make scientists who will not just contribute to the development of industry but also contribute to the development of knowledge, joining others in this great adventure of our times, and, of course, obtaining enormous pleasure in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, there is good reason to study nature to appreciate its wonder and its beauty, even though one may not become an actively‑working professional scientist. This knowledge of nature also gives a feeling of stability and reality about the world and drives out many fears and superstitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fourth value in teaching science is to teach how things are found out. The value of questioning, the value of free ideas – not only for the development of science, but the value of free ideas in every field – becomes apparent. Science is a way to teach how something gets to be known, what is not known, to what extent things are known (for nothing is known absolutely), how to handle doubt and uncertainty, what the rules of evidence are, how to think about things so that judgments can be made, how to distinguish truth from fraud, and from show. These are certainly important secondary yields of teaching science, and physics in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, in learning science you learn to handle trial and error, to develop a spirit of invention and of free inquiry which is of tremendous value far beyond science. One learns to ask oneself: "Is there a better way to do it?" (And the answer to this is not the conditioned reflex: "Let's see how they do it in the United States," because there must certainly be a better way than that!) We must try to think of some new gimmick or idea, to find some improvement in the technique. This question is the source of a great deal of free independent thought, of invention, and of human progress of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ends my list of reasons for the teaching of physics as a science. Let me turn now to a description of some of the major characteristics of science education in Latin America which appear to me to be of special concern for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, and most serious, I believe, is the almost exclusive teaching and learning by means of pure abject memory. This in no way teaches physics as a science. Nothing is understood; it is only remembered. This in no way satisfies the reasons I outlined for teaching science. Memorization of laws does not permit one to make applications of these laws to new situations; it does not permit one the pleasure of ultimately making scientific contributions; it cannot teach any techniques with the hands. From memorizing, knowledge is not understood, and the beauty of nature is not appreciated. It does not tell how things were found out, or reveal the value of an inventive free mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the telescope is an interesting device to make, understand, look through, and play with. It turned men's ideas and minds in new directions. It gave a great impetus to the modern revolution of thought. For a long while it was the sole revealer of the vastness of the heavens and man's modest place in it. But, in Latin America one learns that there are four kinds of telescopes: the Newtonian, the Cassigranian, etc., etc. In the first, the image is virtual and inverted, etc. (I put in all this "etc." because I really don't know how many kinds of telescopes there are, or what their names are, or which way the image is in each kind. But don't underestimate me; I know a very great deal about telescopes – how they work, how to make and use one, their powers and limitations, etc.) The result is that the telescope is lost. There is no more telescope, no lenses, no stars, no eyes, no light – just words memorized without requiring understanding. The examination is passed, for the question was "What are the four types of telescopes?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I must say immediately that I am not against memorizing. Some things, even many (though nothing special) may be learned by heart; for example, it is good, but not essential, to know by heart 7 x 8 = 56. What I oppose in any teaching philosophy is that the philosophy is used exclusively; but in this case it is especially serious because so little is left of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was incomprehensible to the people of my country when I reported how material is memorized in Latin America completely without understanding. Lectures are dictated so slowly that students can copy them word for word into their notebooks – and sentences are even repeated so they can check them back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked what Brewster's Law is, advanced students answer in a flash: "Light impinging on a material of index n is 100 percent polarized with the electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence if the tangent of the angle of incidence equals the index of refraction."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To these same students I then say, "Look out at the bay from which the sunlight is being reflected. If I look at that reflection through this piece of polaroid and turn it, what will happen?" All I receive are blank stares. No one knows. But I get cries of surprise and delight when they try it and see the reflections getting brighter and dimmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows something is completely wrong. There is no knowledge whatsoever of nature. With the wrong entrance clue the memorization is useless. These students are like books, no more. I can look in the index of a book under "Brewster's Law" and find a reference equivalent to the students' reply. But in the index I cannot find "sun reflecting on bay."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do the students know that is not easily and directly available in a book? The things that can be looked up in a book are only a part of knowledge. Who wants such a student to work in a plant when a book requiring no food or maintenance stands day after day always ready to give just as adequate answers? Who wants to be such a student, to have worked so hard, to have missed so much of interest and pleasure, and to be outdone by an inanimate printed list of "laws"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What experience I have makes me think that this is one of the main failures in the education of students in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second problem in Latin America is that the students are all alone. They cannot converse with other students; they cannot see how stupid some fellow students are. This is mainly for some psychological reason. They do not wish to be found unsure, for they will be ridiculed. They cannot ask questions in class because the others later say, "Why do you waste the time of all of us? Everyone knows that." So, to save face, they all put on a show of knowledge, thereby frustrating free discussion and the exchange of ideas – one of the pleasantest and easiest ways of learning things. There is too much show, and too much formality in the classroom for any exercise of free thought and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A third problem is the lack of freedom in the university structure. You cannot move around from one subject to another or from one lab to another. Those who go abroad to learn find it difficult to communicate their new knowledge easily and directly to the university students when they return – for they cannot find a place in, and are not welcomed into, the university structure. For some reason or other, it becomes necessary for such people to create new and separate research institutes. The spirit of excitement in these institutions as their research progresses is not found in the universities, and this is quite unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another problem in Latin America is that there is very little outlet for the students who do not want to become complete scientists. It is not easy for them to obtain jobs in the developing industries here. Perhaps if these students were really adequately trained, the companies would gradually realize their value and this problem would disappear. But some of the enthusiastic students are not geniuses, and there must be some place for them to go – even though they are not going to make any scientific contribution, or become second Einsteins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I began studying at MIT I started in mathematics, and probably I thought I would be a mathematician. Then I discovered that the only use of higher mathematics is to teach more higher mathematics and I turned to something more practical – electrical engineering. Finally I realized I had gone too far in the other direction and chose something in between – physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was all very easy because, for such closely related subjects, the courses taken by students in each discipline were almost exactly the same and were taught by the same professors. The engineers studied physics taught by the physicists, for instance, and the physicists learned some of their electricity in a course taught by the professors of electrical engineering. It is easy for students to move back and forth among related disciplines. If physics is too difficult for them, or mathematics too abstract, they can turn to engineering and can later expect to find a position somewhere. Such changes are much more difficult in Latin American universities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another characteristic of the situation in Latin America is the small number of people involved: the result is a rapid fluctuation and irregularity in the character of organizations and institutions. How something goes depends very much on particular individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we must mention the problem of the best students leaving to go to other countries. This is because of the lack of opportunities in Latin America, the climate of rigidity that exists in the universities, and the vagaries of fortune of the research institutions as their budgets find uneven support from year to year, from the government and private sources of funds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should now like to give some of the questions for which I think we must seek answers here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, how can we free the lower levels of secondary education from the drudge memorization that exists at the present time? It is well known that you can get children quite interested in science in a true, live, and active way while they are young. It is sometimes said you cannot get them interested by the time they are in the university, but this is not true – provided they have not been destroyed as thinking humans at the earlier levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gibbon said: "The power of instruction is of little efficacy, except in those happy dispositions where it is nearly superfluous." This is not really true. It is true of good instruction, but bad instruction can be very efficacious indeed in impressing on one how impossibly dull some subject is. It is possible to destroy the excitement and interest that students may have gained by discovering a small book in the library, by buying a toy, a chemistry set, or a little electric motor – by playing around. In fact, one of the most important sources of motivation of interest in science is in a toy, or in a special book, and from those few teachers who are free enough from the bonds of an educational system to be able to keep children excited and inspired by supplying them with suggestions, demonstrations, and games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a well known experience in education that, in spite of all plans and programs, ultimately almost everything depends on teachers – on individual teachers. You can have poor teachers and, no matter what you try to do with them, the students learn very little. Or you can have good teachers and it doesn't make much difference what you do, provided you leave the teacher free. So I think we must find how to free those few teachers who can be inspiring to children. It is important that those inspiring teachers work along with children, suggesting experiments and trying them freely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second question we shall have to try to answer is how to bring engineers and other applied scientists closer to their real world of application. It is not enough for them to remember exactly how to use the formula, providing that the situation is exactly the same as the situation was in the engineering school when the professor dictated the lecture. We must do something to make the applied engineer more flexible, so that he is effective in a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way may be to have true scientists – and especially active research experimental physicists – teaching physics to some engineering students. Experimental physics generates technical problems. To succeed, you have to work with your hands; you have to meet reality; pure memory won't do. So, people who are good at experimental physics know what engineering problems are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The development of industrial technology is in a great measure simply the wider application of techniques which in most cases were developed by scientists trying to do experiments. This is because, in trying to do some experiment in science, you have to push some technique to the extreme. In doing so, you learn how things can be done. Experimental physicists first pursued the problems of how to make a higher vacuum or a lower temperature than ever before, and now high vacuum and low temperatures are tools of industrial technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, experimental science is a source of engineering and experimental science should be taught to engineers in school to keep them aware of the wide range of techniques available and the open possibilities of the future. Perhaps, then, after we have created enough real engineers with real value to industry in Latin America, industry will see that there is no advantage to hiring engineers from overseas and will want more of the locally-trained men and will support the schools with methods of teaching which produce such engineers. Then we will have the ball rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I understand that the number of engineering schools in Latin America is growing rapidly. For example, in Brazil there are twice as many engineering schools as there were ten years ago. If this is the case, then maybe the problem can solve itself. If these schools are not all organized under the same system, if there is a variety in the schools, then one or another school may develop a way to produce excellent students – if the secondary school preparation has not first ruined them. Then this school will acquire a reputation, children will try to go there, other schools will try to compete and copy the better methods‑and so on until the problem solves itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third problem that we have here is how to encourage the true research workers and keep them from leaving home permanently. We have to supply them with books, with experimental equipment, with money for visits abroad, and with a coterie of active interested students. No, excuse me – the coterie will form automatically if the researcher is good and can get to students in any way at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is imperative to encourage the true research worker who is making contributions to science to make his home base in his own country. This should not be hard because there are strong feelings of patriotism in these men; they know they have a great deal to give their country and want to give it. The difficulty is the terrible problems they have at home. For example, the physics research center in Rio, which is one of the leading ones in Latin America, has become isolated from the rest of the world because of a very simple thing: Nobody wants to pay for the Physical Review or Nuovo Cimento. Nobody wants to pay for the journals that can keep people informed of what happens somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This, along with the fact that salaries are absurdly low, shows a lack of interest by the Brazilian government, people, and industry, in the development of science in this country. It is an attitude that does not respect or understand the value of these men. These creating scientists should have a dignity and a power to control their own destiny, and that of science and of science education in their countries. It will be in safe, loving hands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is from the fountain of research workers who understand what science is really about that the true spirit of inquiry rains onto their students, and their students' students, and ultimately, if things are organized right, permeates the entire educational system and speeds the technical development of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fourth problem, then, is how to get these research workers back into the universities where they belong. Then the "rain" will have a far easier and direct passage to the students, the new scientists of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should like to emphasize, by addressing my fifth and final question to the problem, the importance of doing any of these things in a steady, consistent, continuous, and modest way. It should not be done with a big show, the big money, with much advertising, unsupported in the future by any effective maintenance. Maintenance is lacking in many of these projects, for these things have happened before. Pulses of energy have been liberated, forward steps have been taken, only to slip back for lack of continued support. It is necessary to keep up anything that works out. It is necessary to provide a continuous, consistent, perpetual support and to make things more modest so that continuity of support can be maintained. A research group becomes world famous only after years of fruitful research. One year of no support and people drift away and there is nothing left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate that this is a problem of great difficulty and seriousness because it involves so closely all of the social and economic circumstances in the country, and the difficulties are often (but not always) merely the reflection of the vastly more serious problems of the varying fortune of the country as a whole. Yet we ought to discuss it further here. We might try to see if there are ways to work out a scheme so that the educational system, or at least such critical parts of it as research scientists or especially good teachers, is partially independent of the variations in success of the government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it should not be completely supported by government. Perhaps greater efforts to obtain private funds might work. Possibly more reliance on, and contact with, more permanent institutions like religious schools might sustain the continuity of these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have discussed the problems as directly. and frankly as possible, as I see them. I don't mean to make any criticism, except in the same spirit as any discussion we shall have later will represent a criticism. For surely we shall not all find everything well with the present situation in physics education in Latin America. If so, we would not have had such a meeting. I have tried to avoid making too many specific active suggestions on how to proceed, because this is our job for the rest of this meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthetic DNA and RNA molecules are foundational to a host of next-generation technologies crucial for national security and global well-being, impacting everything from resilient supply chains and advanced materials manufacturing to sustainable agriculture and human health. However, current methods for creating these molecules de novo face significant limitations in terms of scale, complexity, and environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Generative Optogenetics (GO) program seeks to overcome these challenges by pioneering a revolutionary approach: Harnessing the power of light to direct the synthesis of DNA and RNA directly within living cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If successful, this high-risk, high-reward research program promises to revolutionize medicine, agriculture, and manufacturing by enabling a new era of bioprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI agents are starting to eat SaaS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We spent fifteen years watching software eat the world. Entire industries got swallowed by software - retail, media, finance - you name it, there has been incredible disruption over the past couple of decades with a proliferation of SaaS tooling. This has led to a huge swath of SaaS companies - valued, collectively, in the trillions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my last post debating if the cost of software has dropped 90% with AI coding agents I mainly looked at the supply side of the market. What will happen to demand for SaaS tooling if this hypothesis plays out? I've been thinking a lot about these second and third order effects of the changes in software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The calculus on build vs buy is starting to change. Software ate the world. Agents are going to eat SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The signals I'm seeing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The obvious place to start is simply demand starting to evaporate - especially for "simpler" SaaS tools. I'm sure many software engineers have started to realise this - many things I'd think to find a freemium or paid service for I can get an agent to often solve in a few minutes, exactly the way I want it. The interesting thing is I didn't even notice the shift. It just happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I want an internal dashboard, I don't even think that Retool or similar would make it easier. I just build the dashboard. If I need to re-encode videos as part of a media ingest process, I just get Claude Code to write a robust wrapper round ffmpeg - and not incur all the cost (and speed) of sending the raw files to a separate service, hitting tier limits or trying to fit another API's mental model in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is even more pronounced for less pure software development tasks. For example, I've had Gemini 3 produce really high quality UI/UX mockups and wireframes in minutes - not needing to use a separate service or find some templates to start with. Equally, when I want to do a presentation, I don't need to use a platform to make my slides look nice - I just get Claude Code to export my markdown into a nicely designed PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other, potentially more impactful, shift I'm starting to see is people really questioning renewal quotes from larger "enterprise" SaaS companies. While this is very early, I believe this is a really important emerging behaviour. I've seen a few examples now where SaaS vendor X sends through their usual annual double-digit % increase in price, and now teams are starting to ask "do we actually need to pay this, or could we just build what we need ourselves?". A year ago that would be a hypothetical question at best with a quick 'no' conclusion. Now it's a real option people are putting real effort into thinking through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, most SaaS products contain many features that many customers don't need or use. A lot of the complexity in SaaS product engineering is managing that - which evaporates overnight when you have only one customer (your organisation). And equally, this customer has complete control of the roadmap when it is the same person. No more hoping that the SaaS vendor prioritises your requests over other customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The maintenance objection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key objection to this is "who maintains these apps?". Which is a genuine, correct objection to have. Software has bugs to fix, scale problems to solve, security issues to patch and that isn't changing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think firstly it's important to point out that a lot of SaaS is poorly maintained (and in my experience, often the more expensive it is, the poorer the quality). Often, the security risk comes from having an external third party itself needing to connect and interface with internal data. If you can just move this all behind your existing VPN or access solution, you suddenly reduce your organisation's attack surface dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of this, agents themselves lower maintenance cost dramatically. Some of the most painful maintenance tasks I've had - updating from deprecated libraries to another one with more support - are made significantly easier with agents, especially in statically typed programming ecosystems. Additionally, the biggest hesitancy with companies building internal tools is having one person know everything about it - and if they leave, all the internal knowledge goes. Agents don't leave. And with a well thought through AGENTS.md file, they can explain the codebase to anyone in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, SaaS comes with maintenance problems too. A recent flashpoint I've seen this month from a friend is a SaaS company deciding to deprecate their existing API endpoints and move to another set of APIs, which don't have all the same methods available. As this is an essential system, this is a huge issue and requires an enormous amount of resource to update, test and rollout the affected integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not suggesting that SMEs with no real software knowledge are going to suddenly replace their entire SaaS suite. What I do think is starting to happen is that organisations with some level of tech capability and understanding are going to think even more critically at their SaaS procurement and vendor lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The economics problem for SaaS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SaaS valuations are built on two key assumptions: fast customer growth and high NRR (often exceeding 100%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we can start to see a world already where demand from new customers for certain segments of tooling and apps begins to decline. That's a problem, and will cause an increase in the sales and marketing expenditure of these companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the more insidious one is net revenue retention (NRR) declines. NRR is a measure of how much existing customers spend with you on an ongoing basis, adjusted for churn. If your NRR is at 100%, your existing cohort of customers are spending the same. If it's less than that then they are spending less with you and/or customers are leaving overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many great SaaS companies have NRR significantly above 100%. This is the beauty of a lot of SaaS business models - companies grow and require more users added to their plan. Or they need to upgrade from a lower priced tier to a higher one to gain additional features. These increases are generally very profitable. You don't need to spend a fortune on sales and marketing to get this uptick (you already have a relationship with them) and the profit margin of adding another 100 user licenses to a SaaS product for a customer is somewhere close to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where I think some SaaS companies will get badly hit. People will start migrating parts of the solution away to self-built/modified internal platforms to avoid having to pay significantly more for the next pricing tier up. Or they'll ingest the data from your platform via your APIs and build internal dashboards and reporting which means they can remove 80% of their user licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where this doesn't work (and what still has a moat)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The obvious one is anything that requires very high uptime and SLAs. Getting to four or five 9s is really hard, and building high availability systems gets really difficult - and it's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot building them. As such, things like payment processing and other core infrastructure are pretty safe in my eyes. You're not (yet) going to replace Stripe and all their engineering work on core payments easily with an agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equally, very high volume systems and data lakes are difficult to replace. It's not trivial to spin up clusters for huge datasets or transaction volumes. This again requires specialised knowledge that is likely to be in short supply at your organisation, if it exists at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other one is software with significant network effects - where you collaborate with people, especially external to your organisation. Slack is a great example - it's not something you are going to replace with an in-house tool. Equally, products with rich integration ecosystems and plugin marketplaces have a real advantage here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And companies that have proprietary datasets are still very valuable. Financial data, sales intelligence and the like stay valuable. If anything, I think these companies have a real edge as agents can leverage this data in new ways - they get more locked in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, regulation and compliance is still very important. Many industries require regulatory compliance - this isn't going to change overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This does require your organisation having the skills (internally or externally) to manage these newly created apps. I think products and people involved in SRE and DevOps are going to have a real upswing in demand. I suspect we'll see entirely new functions and teams in companies solely dedicated to managing these new applications. This does of course have a cost, but this cost can be often managed by existing SRE or DevOps functions, or if it requires new headcount and infrastructure, amortised over a much higher number of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who's most at risk?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me the companies that are at serious risk are back-office tools that are really just CRUD logic - or simple dashboards and analytics on top of their customers' own data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tools often generate a lot of friction - because they don't work exactly the way the customer wants them to - and they are tools that are the most easily replaced with agents. It's very easy to document the existing system and tell the agent to build something, but with the pain points removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SaaS certainly isn't dead. Like any major shifts in technology, there are winners and losers. I do think the bar is going to be much higher for many SaaS products that don't have a clear moat or proprietary knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's going to be difficult to predict is how quickly agents can move up the value chain. I'm assuming that agents can't manage complex database clusters - but I'm not sure that's going to be the case for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I'm not seeing a path for every company to suddenly replace all their SaaS spend. If anything, I think we'll see (another) splintering in the market. Companies with strong internal technical ability vs those that don't. This becomes yet another competitive advantage for those that do - and those that don't will likely see dramatically increased costs as SaaS providers try and recoup some of the lost sales from the first group to the second who are less able to switch away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But my key takeaway would be that if your product is just a SQL wrapper on a billing system, you now have thousands of competitors: engineers at your customers with a spare Friday afternoon with an agent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;If AI replaces workers, should it also pay taxes?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technological race among industry giants and the wave of layoffs they have announced has revived the debate about the advisability of taxing automation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can’t be seen or touched, but it’s shaking up markets and attracting investment. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become the object of desire for Big Tech, which is pouring astronomical sums into its development, fueled by record profits. The other side of this frenzy is workforce reductions, with automation as the backdrop, announced by multinationals like Amazon, Meta, and UPS, which, incidentally, threaten to extend the impact of new technologies to another area: public coffers. Fewer people working means fewer taxpayers, so the question naturally arises: if machines and algorithms replace humans in their jobs, should they also have to cover the taxes that humans stop paying?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labor, through income tax and social security contributions, is one of the pillars of the tax systems of almost all countries, and the impact of automation on the tax base — or, in other words, the potential decrease in revenue — is not a new concern. In 2019, Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps proposed a tax on robots to help maintain social benefits. Shortly before, Bill Gates, founder of one of the world’s largest technology companies, Microsoft, which has its own artificial intelligence (Copilot), had suggested applying the same tax burden to robots as would be borne by the workers they replace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The trend toward automation and AI could lead to a decrease in tax revenues. In the United States, for example, about 85% of federal tax revenue comes from labor income,” says Sanjay Patnaik, director of the Center for Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. He suggests that governments address “the risks posed by AI” by increasing capital gains taxation rather than creating a specific tax on it, due to the difficulties in designing such a tax and the distortions it could generate. The repeated use of the conditional tense is because the impact of generative AI, the kind capable of creating content on demand, is still uncertain, both in positive terms — improved productivity and economic growth — and negative terms; job losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, forecasts are mixed. Goldman Sachs, for example, estimates that AI will boost global GDP by 7% over the next decade; the IMF predicts it will contribute up to eight-tenths of a percentage point annually to growth between now and 2030. On the other hand, the International Labour Organization estimates that one in four workers worldwide, concentrated in high-income countries, holds a job with some degree of exposure to AI, but at the same time predicts that most jobs will be transformed rather than disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know there will be an impact, but it’s difficult to quantify,” confirms Luz Rodríguez, a professor of labor law and a former Spanish Secretary of State for Employment. “The previous wave of automation affected employment in the middle of the production chain; generative AI is targeting higher up the ladder, more skilled jobs that require critical thinking,” she summarizes. “I’m not optimistic, but I am positive: there are jobs being created that wouldn’t exist without new technologies, such as content moderators on social media or Bitcoin miners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Waldenström, a professor at the Stockholm Institute for Industrial Economics, rejects the idea of a specific tax on AI, arguing that there has been no significant increase in unemployment, even in the United States, the birthplace of these new technologies and a leader in their implementation. He also emphasizes the difficulty in defining it precisely: “What are automation, robots, or AI? A chip, a humanoid machine, an application, or a computer program? We will never be able to define it precisely. We should continue taxing what already exists: income from labor, consumption, and capital gains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also joined the debate. In a report published last summer, the organization’s economists reached a mixed conclusion: they did not recommend specifically taxing AI — as this could stifle productivity and distort the market — but urged governments to remain vigilant against potential disruptive scenarios. Their proposals included raising taxes on capital — which have been decreasing as the tax burden on labor has increased — creating a supplementary tax on “excessive” corporate profits, and reviewing tax incentives for innovation, patents, and other intangible assets that, while boosting productivity, can also displace human jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Frey, associate professor of AI and Work at Oxford University and author of the book How Progress Ends (Princeton University Press, 2025), holds a similar view: he does not support an AI tax, but acknowledges that the tax system has become unbalanced. “In many OECD economies, we have seen an increase in income taxes and a decrease in capital taxes,” he notes. This system incentivizes companies to invest more in automation than in job-creating technologies. “Addressing this imbalance is essential to supporting the job-creating technologies of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent moves by major tech companies and the evolution of tax systems in recent years justify this concern. Amazon, for example, has announced a 38% increase in profits and multimillion-dollar investments in AI, while simultaneously reporting 14,000 job cuts worldwide. Meanwhile, corporate tax rates have plummeted in the last decade in OECD countries, from 33% in 2000 to the current 25%; the tax wedge for workers — income tax and social security contributions — has decreased by only 1.3 percentage points in the same period, from 36.2% to 34.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susanne Bieller, secretary general of the International Federation of Robotics, argues that applying ad hoc taxes stems from “a problem that doesn’t exist,” since automation and robots “create new jobs by increasing productivity.” She warns that taxing production tools instead of business profits “would have a negative impact” on competitiveness and employment. “We need incentives for [European] companies to use technologies like robots and digitalization to remain competitive globally,” she concludes. “The world faces a labor shortage of approximately 40 million jobs per year [...] Robots cannot take over entire jobs, but they can handle certain tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Inequality&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to employment, the soaring spending of major tech companies on AI and the surge in their stock prices are causing concern, raising fears of a bubble. Analysts also warn that the energy consumption of these technologies is so high that their climate footprint could offset the promised growth benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the best-case scenario, the new jobs created by AI could be “more productive, better paid, and more accessible,” offsetting job and tax losses, predicts Patnaik. However, the latent — and very likely — risk remains that the process will not be automatic. Job creation could be delayed, less-skilled professionals could struggle to adapt, and a gap could emerge between countries — and within them — and across productive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT economists Daron Acemoğlu and Simon Johnson warned about this in 2023. “Over the past four decades, automation has increased productivity and multiplied corporate profits, but it has not led to shared prosperity in industrialized countries,” they cautioned in a document for the IMF. “Technology and artificial intelligence produce social impacts that are relevant to politics. We cannot allow technological determinism,” Rodríguez asserts. “The debate is necessary, and we will go wherever we want to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Si continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.&lt;/p&gt;Flecha&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Si quieres compartir tu cuenta, cambia tu suscripción a la modalidad Premium, así podrás añadir otro usuario.

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday, December 14th 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Microsoft Copilot AI Comes to LG TVs, and Can't Be Deleted&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Copilot AI chatbot is arguably one of the most controversial add-ons ever implemented in the Windows 11 operating system. However, the controversy doesn't stop at PC operating systems. It seems to extend to TVs as well. According to Reddit user u/defjam16, his LG TV webOS received an update that installed Microsoft's Copilot AI app, with no option to remove it. Although users can choose to ignore it, the push for increased AI integration in everyday products is becoming unavoidable, even on TVs. What exactly can a Copilot AI app do in your TV? We don't know either.&lt;lb/&gt;Microsoft is likely promoting its Copilot on TVs to capture more of the AI app market, aiming to become the go-to platform for AI inquiries. Since webOS is a Linux-based TV operating system LG uses, it is also possible that Microsoft is preparing the Copilot AI app for a wider rollout to Linux users, who are now officially commanding a 3% market share among PCs. Other TV operating system platforms are also at "risk" of getting a dedicated Microsoft Copilot AI app, which is especially bad for people not wanting their TV to do any AI processing.Additionally, LG has a setting called "Live Plus" that Reddit users highlighted. When it's turned on, the TV can recognize what's displayed on screen and use that viewing information for personalized recommendations and ads. LG describes it as an "enhanced viewing experience," but you can disable it in the menu under Settings &amp;gt; All Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Additional Settings (though exact wording varies by model). This likely uses another AI model to help sort the user data and make recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Sources: Reddit, via VideoCardz &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is likely promoting its Copilot on TVs to capture more of the AI app market, aiming to become the go-to platform for AI inquiries.

I don't think I will ever let it on the internet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Shihab*Shrugs*explain? how else would you use a tv today? everything goes over the internet connection/glass fiber, the phone as well.&lt;lb/&gt;Well, to be fair, if you use a "smar" "TV and you allow it access to the internet, you kinda already are a willing participants in the core, ens***ification process...&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll never understand companies that do this shit. Like, I'd go with LG or Samsung literally because it's not Google or Microsoft and here comes idiot LG and preloads Copilot on everyone's TVs with no ability to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been on my LG for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News Editor &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Didn't have it my previous TV and not on this one, so I doubt it'll happen in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who TV OS is good?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surely they're not forcing you to use it..., yet.... and you can just turn any settings off. These TVs come with lots of other apps you can't remove as well. &lt;lb/&gt;If not, then I guess easy call to not buy an LG products or root them if that's possibly and you're unfortunate enough to own already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not, then I guess easy call to not buy an LG products or root them if that's possibly and you're unfortunate enough to own already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must be getting old, cant keep up with this new lingo.

I didn't know LG doesn't want me to buy their TVs THAT bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ReadlightWho TV OS is good?Pretty much none. I've never seen a single Android TV that wasn't a laggy mess, Tizen on low end TVs is lag incarnate and webOS is aw half hearted as it gets. I like my G3 but it's single biggest weakness is the awful OS and the fact LG did not update it to receive the newer features from the G4+ like Dolby Vision for PC.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, stuck with this thing at least until 2028, ideally 2030 so better get used to it I guess&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ZoneDymoexplain? how else would you use a tv today? everything goes over the internet connection/glass fiber, the phone as well.Hook it to a betmax vcr, of course! :cool:&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seriously tho, my qualms were not with the act of transmitting something over the internet (the transmitted content itself notwithstanding). I did say “letting it [the TV] access the internet,” not what someone’s brainrot-of-choice is served through…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for how, the vcr joke was only half that. Compartmentalisation is possible. Often not convenient or even within the ability of your average consumer (depends on your locale tho), but then again convenience is the main source of all inflow to this cesspit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a f-ton of assorted "apps" on my C2 already. I don't suppose Copilot is any worse privacy wise than, eg youtube, assuming that these apps don't activate themselves on their own and I don't think they can do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ShihabHook it to a betmax vcr, of course! :cool:If I want to watch just normal TV I have to pay per month for an extra "tv box" or I can use the app, if I use the app obviously I need to be connected to the internet which is what the tv box or a google chromecast would do as well, but with a smart TV that is just build in.&lt;lb/&gt;Seriously tho, my qualms were not with the act of transmitting something over the internet (the transmitted content itself notwithstanding).

Thankfully I don't have LG, one less thing to be irritated by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read this article again and I think it is a bit misleading overall. I'm away from my LG atm, so can't check it myself, but I’m pretty sure that this app lives in the Apps zone, with all the others, and can't do any "AI processing" on its own. Meaning, unless you actually go to Apps and fire it up and use it, it will just sit there without any spying etc (assuming you have the privacy settings sorted).&lt;lb/&gt;Secondly, not saying that "smart" TVs are a good thing, but your Google-infested phone &amp;amp; PC does more spying every second than this thing. Something to consider before you get up in arms about it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, not saying that "smart" TVs are a good thing, but your Google-infested phone &amp;amp; PC does more spying every second than this thing.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;John Varley died two days ago on December 10, 2025. A great many will mourn him as a science fiction writer whose work they enjoyed. But this misses his moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the mid-1970s, Varley exploded into science fiction like a phoenix. His "Eight Worlds" stories were set in a future where hyper-powerful aliens have killed everyone on Earth as a threat to its whales and porpoises and humanity survives everywhere else in the Solar System. Despite this bleak background, the stories were bright and inventive. People change gender on a whim. Wealthy and glorious cities turn to shacks and hovels when their holographic fronts are turned off at night. People bank their memories so that, upon death, they can be restarted with new memories. He wrote so many major stories per year that, in a resurrection of an old pulp-days practice, some had to be published under a pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were all dazzled. His work was full of impressive new ideas. And, outside of the Eight Worlds sequence, he wrote things like "In the Hall of the Martian Kings," which resurrected the possibility of intelligent life on Mars after the Mariner probes had apparently disproved that. Or "Air Raid," which made air travel terrifying again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His novel Titan looked to be the opening of a classic trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Briefly--for almost a decade--John Varley seemed to be the new Robert Heinlein.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, alas, he went to Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hollywood paid him to write, rewrite, and rererewrite a script for Millennium (based on "Air Raid") while five directors came and went. Unsurprisingly, the result pleased nobody--most particularly Varley himself. His novelization of the movie made that abundantly clear. Then, by the man's own testimony, he was paid more and more and more money to write scripts that were never made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After too long an absence, Varley returned to print. He was every bit as good a writer as he'd ever been. But his ideas were no longer new. In his absence, writers like William Gibson and Neal Stephenson had moved the cutting edge along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereafter, Varley was only a very good science fiction writer. It is this person that most of his readers will mourn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I will mourn the man who, for a time, seemed to be the resurrection of science fiction, the New Heinlein, the kwisatz haderach of genre. Back then, he set the standard. His were the stories we all wanted to equal and perhaps surpass. He was the reason we read science fiction in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long, long ago, when I was yet unpublished, I found myself talking with Isaac Asimov at I forget which convention, when John Varley cruised by, trailed by enthusiastic fans. Asimov gazed sadly after him and said, "Look at him. A decade ago, everybody was asking, 'Who is John Varley?' A decade from now, everybody will be asking, 'Who is Isaac Asimov?'"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that was John Varley's moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Unscii is a set of bitmapped Unicode fonts based on classic system fonts. Unscii attempts to support character cell art well while also being suitable for terminal and programming use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two main variants are unscii-8 (8Ã8 pixels per glyph) and unscii-16 (8Ã16). There are also several alternative styles for unscii-8, as well as an 8x16 "full" variant that incorporates missing Unicode glyphs from Fixedsys Excelsior and GNU Unifont. "unscii-16-full" falls under GPL because of how Unifont is licensed; the other variants are in the Public Domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unscii was created by Viznut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020-03-10, the new Unicode version 13.0 added 214 graphics characters for "legacy computing" (including, among all, the missing PETSCII characters, and a majority of missing Teletext/Videotex characters). Most of these were already included in Unscii 1.x, but now I have been able to give them proper Unicode mappings as well. This is the main reason for the Unscii 2.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Unscii 2.0 fixes errors in some characters, legibility in some others and adds a bunch of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A test picture representing what is currently available in Unicode (feel free to copy-paste it to your editor to see what it looks like in other fonts):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here are some conversions of legacy character set art into Unscii.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amiga ansi: Divine Stylers by Hellbeard, as rendered with unscii-16. Source&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PC ansi: Ansi Love by Rad Man, as rendered with unscii-16. Source&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commodore 64 petscii pictures as rendered with unscii-8, using the 256-color xterm palette: I Has Floppy by Redcrab; The First Ball by Dr.TerrorZ; Gary by Mermaid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source code package includes a generic bitmap-to-unscii converter. Here's an example of a conversion to unscii-8 using the 256-color xterm palette, without dithering:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HEX and PCF are the only actual bitmapped formats here. HEX is the same simple hexdump format as used by the Unifont project. TTF, OTF and WOFF are vectorized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: Due to format limitations, the PCF versions lack all the characters above U+FFFF! However, all the new graphics characters are provided in the good old PUA range as well. A mapping is in the file uns2uni.tr.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-16: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-8-tall: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-8-thin: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-8-alt: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-8-mcr: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-8-fantasy: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Years ago, I noticed that Unicode had a bunch of pseudographic characters that could be used to enrichen Ansi art. However, no one seemed to use them. Even MUDs that used the 256-color Xterm palette and had no issues with Unicode still preferred to stick to the blocks available in the MS-DOS codepage 437.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After looking into existing Unicode fonts, the reason became obvious: the implementation of non-CP437 graphics characters was shaky at best. Unicode Consortium doesn't even care how pseudographics are implemented. It was a kind of chicken-and-egg problem: No commonly accepted Unicode graphics font, no Unicode art scene; no art scene, no font support. The idea of an art-compatible Unicode font was born.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Unscii, I studied a bunch of classic system fonts and how their characters had been used in Ascii and "extended-Ascii" art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8Ã8 system fonts can be divided in two major categories according to their line thickness: 1-pixel and 2-pixel. 2-pixel-wide lines are used in more prominent classic systems, so I chose it. Also, 2-pixel 8Ã8 system fonts are surprisingly similar to one another which made it easier to choose neutral shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic look of the 8Ã8 variant of Unscii is based on the following systems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 8Ã16 variant of Unscii has been mostly derived from the 8Ã8 variant by using a set of transformation principles. When in doubt, the following fonts have been looked at for additional reference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, neutral shapes are preferred, unless art, legibility or readability require otherwise: The characters /\XY are connective because of their connetive use in ascii art, and the serifs in iIl are longer than in most classic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever a 8Ã16 shape has not been defined, Unscii falls back to height-doubled 8Ã8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also studied game fonts and thin-line system fonts. This resulted in the variants unscii-8-thin, unscii-8-mcr and unscii-8-fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When studying legacy character sets, I found literally hundreds of characters without proper Unicode codepoints. These are mapped in the PUA range as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Unicode 13.0, many of these are also available in Unicode, but the PUA mappings are retained for compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding good tree-sitter grammars is hard. In arborium, every grammar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hand-picked grammars, added missing highlight queries, and updated them to the latest tree-sitter. Tree-sitter parsers compiled to WASM need libc symbols (especially a C allocator)—we provide arborium-sysroot which re-exports dlmalloc and other essentials for wasm32-unknown-unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HTML — custom elements like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-k&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of
                        &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span class="keyword"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. More compact markup. No
                        JavaScript required.
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;a-tg&gt;span&lt;/a-tg&gt;&lt;a-at&gt;class&lt;/a-at&gt;="&lt;a-s&gt;keyword&lt;/a-s&gt;"&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a-p&gt;fn&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;a-tg&gt;span&lt;/a-tg&gt;&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;a-tg&gt;a-k&lt;/a-tg&gt;&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a-p&gt;fn&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;a-tg&gt;a-k&lt;/a-tg&gt;&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANSI — 24-bit true color for terminal applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;macOS, Linux, Windows — tree-sitter handles generating native crates for these platforms. Just add the dependency and go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly — that one's hard. Compiling Rust to WASM with C code that assumes a standard library is tricky. We provide a sysroot that makes this work, enabling Rust-on-the-frontend scenarios like this demo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highlight TOML, shell, and other languages in your rustdoc. Create &lt;code&gt;arborium-header.html&lt;/code&gt;:
                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you maintain docs.rs or rustdoc, you could integrate arborium directly! Either merge this PR for native rustdoc support, or use &lt;code&gt;arborium-rustdoc&lt;/code&gt; as a
                                post-processing step:
                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It streams through HTML, finds &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre class="language-*"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
                                blocks, and highlights them in-place. Works with rustdoc's theme system.
                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syntax highlighting for miette error diagnostics. Beautiful, accurate highlighting in your CLI error messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An incremental static site generator with zero-reload live updates via WASM DOM patching, Sass/SCSS, image processing, font subsetting, and arborium-powered syntax highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing to configure—it just works. Arborium is built in and automatically highlights all code blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 96 languages included, each behind a feature flag. Enable only what you need, or use &lt;code&gt;all-languages&lt;/code&gt; for everything.
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each feature flag comment includes the grammar's license, so you always know what you're shipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highlighter supports themes for both HTML and ANSI output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bundled themes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom themes can be defined programmatically using RGB colors and style attributes (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arborium uses custom HTML elements to mark up syntax. Each tag corresponds to a semantic code element. To create custom themes, target these elements in your CSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-k&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Keyword&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-f&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Function&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-s&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — String&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-c&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Comment&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-t&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Type&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-v&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Variable&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-co&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Constant&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-n&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Number&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-o&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Operator&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Punctuation&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-pr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Property&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-at&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Attribute&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-tg&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Tag (HTML/XML)&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-m&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Macro&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-l&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Label&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-ns&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Namespace&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-cr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Constructor&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-tt&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Title/Heading&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-st&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Strong/Bold&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Emphasis/Italic&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-tu&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Link/URL&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-tl&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Literal/Code&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-tx&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Strikethrough&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-da&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Diff Addition&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-dd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Diff Deletion&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-eb&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Embedded&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-er&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Error&lt;p&gt;For the complete reference with examples and CSS styling tips, see the HTML Tag Reference in the README.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each grammar includes the full tree-sitter runtime embedded in its WASM module. This adds a fixed overhead to every grammar bundle, on top of the grammar-specific parser tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Language&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;C Lines&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Size&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Distribution&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every grammar is compiled to WASM with aggressive size optimizations. Here's the complete build pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compile with nightly Rust using &lt;code&gt;-Zbuild-std&lt;/code&gt; to rebuild the standard library with our optimization flags:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Cpanic=immediate-abort&lt;/code&gt;
                            Skip unwinding machinery
                        &lt;code&gt;-Copt-level=s&lt;/code&gt;
                            Optimize for size, not speed
                        &lt;code&gt;-Clto=fat&lt;/code&gt;
                            Full link-time optimization across all crates
                        &lt;code&gt;-Ccodegen-units=1&lt;/code&gt;
                            Single codegen unit for maximum optimization
                        &lt;code&gt;-Cstrip=symbols&lt;/code&gt;
                            Remove debug symbols
                        &lt;p&gt;Generate JavaScript bindings with &lt;code&gt;--target web&lt;/code&gt; for ES module output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final size optimization pass with Binaryen's optimizer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Oz&lt;/code&gt;
                            Aggressive size optimization
                        &lt;code&gt;--enable-bulk-memory&lt;/code&gt;
                            Faster memory operations
                        &lt;code&gt;--enable-mutable-globals&lt;/code&gt;
                            Required for wasm-bindgen
                        &lt;code&gt;--enable-simd&lt;/code&gt;
                            SIMD instructions where applicable
                        &lt;p&gt;Despite all these optimizations, WASM bundles are still large because each one embeds the full tree-sitter runtime. We're exploring ways to share the runtime across grammars, but that's the architecture trade-off for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those use regex-based tokenization (TextMate grammars). Regexes can't count brackets, track scope, or understand structure—they just pattern-match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tree-sitter actually parses your code into a syntax tree, so it knows that &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; is a keyword only in the right
                                context, handles deeply nested structures correctly, and recovers
                                gracefully from syntax errors.
                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDEs with LSP support (like rust-analyzer) can do even better with semantic highlighting—they understand types and dependencies across files—but tree-sitter gets you 90% of the way there without needing a full language server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbor is Latin for tree (as in tree-sitter), and -ium denotes a place or collection (like aquarium, arboretum).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a place where tree-sitter grammars live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes! Open an issue on the repo with a link to the grammar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll review it and add it if the grammar and highlight queries are in good shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When doing full-stack Rust, it's nice to have exactly the same code on the frontend and the backend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rust crates compile to both native and WASM, so you get one dependency that works everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree-sitter uses table-driven LR parsing. The grammar compiles down to massive state transition tables—every possible parser state and every possible token gets an entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tables are optimized for O(1) lookup speed, not size. A complex grammar like TypeScript can have tens of thousands of states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tradeoff is worth it: you get real parsing (not regex hacks) that handles edge cases correctly and recovers gracefully from syntax errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Whole App is a Blob&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Coffee Problem ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;School French worked perfectly until I tried to buy a coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My lessons must be familiar to all Brits out there: conjugate être until it’s muscle memory, role-play booking a hotel you will never book, then leave school with the comforting illusion that you “know French” in the same way you “know trigonometry”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time French came in useful was a cafe in Chartres, a small town about an hour from Paris with a cathedral, nice streets, and, as far as I could tell that day, a collective commitment to not speaking English.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I walked into a cafe feeling reasonably confident: asked for coffee in my best French and apparently did very well, because the barista replied with the total. It wasn’t even a hard number. But as it arrived as one continuous noise, I instantly gave up and defaulted to the internationally recognised protocol of tapping my card and pretending I am too busy looking at my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the gap language apps don’t really model: not “do you know the words?”, but “can you retrieve them when a human is waiting and you’ve got three seconds before you embarrass yourself?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, planning a few months in Québec, I did what I always do before a move: learn the minimum viable politeness. Hello, sorry, thank you, the numbers, and the scaffolding around “can I get...”–enough to not be a complete nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried the usual apps: the streaks were pristine and the charts looked like I was becoming bilingual. But in my head I was still standing in Chartres, hearing “3,90” as “three-something-or-something” and sweating directly through my self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built a safety net for the specific failure mode: retrieval under pressure, or just a tiny rehearsal room I could open while the kettle boiled, practise the bits that reliably go wrong, and close again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And because I genuinely believe that constraints are important, I wrote down the rule that would make this harder than it needed to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The whole app is a blob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Childhood Trauma ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you grew up with Tamagotchis, you already understand why this was tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not the “cute pixel pet” part. The part where a device the size of a digestive biscuit turns into a low-resolution hostage negotiator. Feed me, clean me, entertain me. And if you don’t, I will beep during maths, get confiscated, and then die alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They were brilliant because they weren’t productivity tools. They were tiny relationships. Everything was implied, physical, slightly unfair, and somehow more motivating than any "Time to stand!" push notification has ever been. If you came back after a day away, the creature didn’t show you a progress chart, it showed you a mood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the shape I wanted for language drills: something that feels less like “open app → consume lesson” and more like “tap creature → it looks at you → you do a small thing together”. I wanted the warmth and the immediacy, without the emotional extortion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my brief turned into a very narrow design constraint with a lot of consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No “home screen” full of destinations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No tests you have to take before you’re allowed to practise.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No progress cathedral you’re meant to worship in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Just one scene, one character, and whatever information absolutely must leak through to make the interaction legible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to say “minimal”, but it’s so much harder to say “minimal and still usable by a human being who did not build it”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blob wasn’t a mascot here, it was the interface. Which meant it had to do interface work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Teaching a Circle to Care ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moment you remove buttons, menus, and visible structure, you inherit a new responsibility: you still owe people answers, you just can’t give them in text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you open a normal learning app, you get reassurance for free. There’s a big obvious “Start” button. There are labels and counters and little UI receipts that say “yes, you are in the right place, yes, tapping this will do something, yes, you did something yesterday”. It’s not glamorous, but it works, and the user doesn’t have to play detective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you open a blob, the user is staring at an animated shape on a gradient background and thinking, with complete justification: are you sure this is an app?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the first UX lesson was painfully simple: minimalism doesn’t grant telepathy. In a normal app the UI does a lot of quiet admin for you: it tells you what you can do next, what will happen if you tap, and whether you’re in the right place. When you delete all of that and leave a blob on a gradient, you’re basically asking the user to infer intent from body language. That can work–but only if the blob is unambiguous about two things: “yes, I’m interactive” and “yes, tapping me will lead somewhere predictable”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early Lexie was just a gently breathing circle. It looked calm, premium, vaguely spa-adjacent. It also looked like something you’d see right before a meditation app asks for an annual subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to solve it the “pure” way first: more animation, more suggestion, more “if you notice the micro-shift in the shape you’ll understand you can begin”. That’s a fun idea if your users have nothing else going on in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the shipped version, there is a Start button. It’s small and it doesn’t dominate the scene. It’s not there because it’s pretty but because people deserve certainty within half a second, and a blob cannot deliver that guarantee on its own without becoming theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a drill starts, nothing “navigates”. A prompt appears near the blob, and as you take your time answering the question, it subtly changes posture like it’s paying attention–a little lean, eyes tracking, the idle breathing tightening slightly. It’s a tiny moment, but it matters because it reframes what’s happening: you’re not entering a mode, you’re getting the creature’s focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then comes the most dangerous part of any character-driven UI: feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where every learning app turns into a casino if you let it. Confetti, fireworks, the whole 4th of July experience (I've seen it only in movies though, not sure why but it's not celebrated in the UK). “Amazing!” “Legendary!” “You’re on a roll!” If you answer correctly, a slot machine explodes. If you answer incorrectly, a disappointed owl files paperwork and probably takes away your dog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not morally superior to particle effects and shaders. I built the confetti version and it was genuinely fun. It was also exhausting in the way a loud pub is exhausting: a bit of stimulation, then a sudden desire to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I stripped it down to feedback that reads instantly and ends quickly. A daily practice gets a small hop, a brief brightening, a few coins that pop out and arc back into the blob like it’s absorbing the reward to acknowledge, not to boost your dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incorrect answers were a bigger design fight than correct ones, because the default instincts are all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first “honest” version made the blob sad. Eyes down, posture slumped, colour cooled. It was expressive and clear, but nobody wants to practise French numbers if it means disappointing a creature you made to be comforting. Tamagotchi could do that to children in the noughties, but adults today will simply uninstall you and go drink water in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I switched the emotion from judgment to confusion. Miss, and Lexie looks like it’s thinking, slightly puzzled, waiting. It still reacts–you still get information–but it doesn’t weaponise your mistake into shame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is design work you don’t have to do if you use normal UI, which is the second UX lesson: removing UI doesn’t remove complexity. It relocates it into motion, timing, and body language, and those are harder to get right because you can’t label them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When Minimalism Hits a Wall ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third UX lesson arrived a week into using my own app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blob was fun, and I kept the drills short. The interaction felt calm in a way most learning apps don’t. I’d open it while waiting for the kettle, do a handful of prompts, watch the creature perk up, and then close it feeling vaguely responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, at some point, I realised I had no idea whether I was improving or just maintaining a pet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the trade you make when you pursue a “single-scene” interface too aggressively: you can remove friction, but you can also remove evidence. If the app never tells you anything in words or numbers, you end up in an uncanny situation where you feel like you’re doing something, but you can’t verify it. It’s the UX equivalent of “trust me, mate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testers (aka my wife, who am I kidding here) said the same thing but in more flattering terms: “Cute!” “Less scary than Duolingo.” Then the one question that matters: “Is this actually helping?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimalism is only luxurious if the user still feels in control. But you can't manage something if you can't measure it. So I broke the “blob only” purity in a way I could live with: I added small receipts that don’t turn the experience into a dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a ring. It fills as you answer, like a quiet “enough for today” signal. When it completes, it does a subtle shimmer and then goes back to being decorative. It’s not there to gamify, it’s there to answer the simplest question: did I do anything meaningful, or did I just tap a circle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, a tiny streak pill. Just a small indicator that you’ve done something today, and that you’ve been roughly consistent recently. If you miss a day, it resets without drama, because drama is the entire behaviour I was trying to design out of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, a stats sheet that’s deliberately buried. There’s a small icon. Tap it and you get a panel with a few plain facts: how much you’ve practised recently and which ranges you struggle with. If you never open it, the app never nags you with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the shape I ended up believing in: keep the main surface quiet, but give the user an audit trail if they ask for it. The blob stays the primary interface, but it no longer asks for blind trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lines I Refused to Cross ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you add rings and streaks and coins, you’re standing at the top of a very slippery slope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One more step and the ring becomes a flame, the streak turns into a guilt mechanic, the blob becomes a supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clearly effective and there apps successfully pulling that off. It’s also the opposite of the thing I was trying to build, so I ended up with a few hard lines that survived every “maybe we should...” conversation I had with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lexie can’t die. No pixel funeral, no neglected-pet tragedy, no “you failed” screen. If you keep getting things wrong, it doesn’t spiral into shame–it just... resets. A quiet little rebirth loop, the most Buddhist mechanic I could ship (I am not, as you can tell, a designer). If you vanish for a week, it goes a bit dim and undercharged, like it’s been sat in Low Power Mode, and then wakes up the second you tap it. Your life is allowed to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no “streak in danger” notification. If reminders ever exist, they’ll sound like a polite tap on the shoulder, not a fire alarm. I am not building a tiny manager that lives in your pocket and counts your absences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no leaderboard. The blob does not know your friends, but you get to keep your very own blob, isn't it cool?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rewards are cosmetic and unserious. You can unlock colours. The blob can wear a beret. It can look slightly more smug after you finally stop mixing up seventy and seventeen. None of it changes the learning itself. It just gives the relationship a bit of texture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where the Tamagotchi inspiration loops back in a healthier form: the creature is there to make the interaction feel human, but it’s not allowed to punish you for being human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Now That I'm in Québec ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time we actually arrived in Québec, I’d gained one extremely specific superpower: I can now hear a price and remain a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“3.99” registers as “money” instead of “incoming humiliation”. Phone numbers no longer turn into a single continuous noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Lexie didn’t solve–and was never meant to solve–is everything around the number. “Pour ici ou pour emporter” is currently my nemesis. The first time someone asked, I understood none of it and answered “oui” with enough confidence to make it everyone’s problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s fine though. The blob isn’t a French course. It drills what it can drill properly, like numbers, some core forms, the boring fundamentals that keep showing up, and then leaves the rest to real life. If you disappear for a week, it is not the end of the world–it just wakes up, gives you some hardcore numbers to translate again, and does a wee level-up jig like you’ve achieved something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which, to be fair, I have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like turning mildly humiliating real-world edge cases into shippable apps; if you have a few of those lying around, send them to work@drobinin.com.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How NVIDIA Turned 'Gaming GPUs Go Brrr' Into 'Actually We Can Read The Language of Life Now' (Part 1 of 2)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Before We Talk About AI, We Need to Talk About Why Proteins Are Ridiculously Complicated&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know what's wild? Right now, as you're reading this, there are approximately 20,000 different types of proteins working inside your body. Not 20,000 total proteins, 20,000 TYPES. The actual number of protein molecules? Billions. Trillions if we're counting across all your cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each one has a specific job. Each one has a specific shape. And if even ONE type folds wrong, one could get Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Parkinson's, Huntington's, mad cow disease, or any of thousands of other diseases collectively called "protein misfolding diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your body makes these proteins perfectly, billions of times a day, in every single one of your 37 trillion cells, without asking your opinion, without requiring a user manual, without ever attending a protein folding workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists spent 50 years, FIFTY YEARS, trying to figure out how to PREDICT what shape a protein would fold into based on its amino acid sequence. Entire careers were built on this problem. Nobel Prizes were awarded for incremental progress. Supercomputers were dedicated to simulating single protein folds that took weeks to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then AI companies showed up in 2020 and said "we got this" and solved it in an afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now? Now we're not just predicting shapes, we're DESIGNING entirely new proteins that have never existed in nature. Proteins that can break down plastic. Proteins that can capture carbon dioxide. Proteins that can target cancer cells with sniper precision. We're playing God with molecules and it's working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But before I tell you how NVIDIA went from making GPUs that render explosions in Call of Duty to designing molecules that might cure cancer, you need to understand what proteins actually are and why this problem was so stupidly, impossibly, hilariously hard that it became one of biology's grand challenges alongside "how does consciousness work" and "what is dark matter."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start from scratch. Forget everything you learned in high school biology. We're doing this right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Proteins 101: The LEGO Bricks of Life (Except Way More Complicated and They Build Themselves)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember from my previous articles: your DNA gets transcribed into RNA, which gets translated into proteins. That's the central dogma. DNA → RNA → Protein. Information flows one way. (Mostly. Retroviruses are weird. Don't worry about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what IS a protein? And I mean really, fundamentally, at the molecular level?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A protein is a chain of amino acids that folds into a specific 3D shape, and that shape determines what the protein does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it. That's the entire definition. A chain. That folds. Into a shape. That does stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as with literally everything in biology, the devil is in the details. And the details are where things get interesting (and by interesting, I mean "ridiculously complicated but in a cool way")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Amino Acids: The 20-Letter Alphabet That Writes Every Function in Your Body&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 20 standard amino acids that your body uses to build proteins. (There are actually a few more non-standard ones, but let's not complicate things yet.) Think of them as letters in an alphabet. But instead of making words and sentences, they make functional machines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each amino acid has the same basic structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An amino group (NH₂) on one end, this is the "amino" in amino acid&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A carboxyl group (COOH) on the other end, this is the "acid" part&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A hydrogen atom attached to the central carbon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A unique side chain (called an R group) attached to the central carbon That side chain, the R group, is where all the personality lives. It's what makes each amino acid unique.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let Me Introduce You to Some Amino Acids (They Have Personalities)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Glycine: The smallest amino acid. Its side chain is just a single hydrogen atom. It's tiny, flexible, fits anywhere. The perfect team player. Gets along with everyone.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proline: The rebel. Has a ring structure that creates kinks in protein chains. Shows up and makes everything bend around it. Doesn't conform to the rules. We respect the energy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cysteine: Contains sulfur. Two cysteines can form a disulfide bond (S-S) with each other, creating a chemical "staple" that holds parts of proteins together. It's the duct tape of amino acids.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tryptophan: Huge, bulky, takes up space. Often found buried in protein cores because it's hydrophobic (hates water). The introvert of amino acids.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aspartic acid and Glutamic acid: Negatively charged. Basically walk around with a permanent bad attitude, repelling other negatively charged amino acids and attracting positive ones.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lysine and Arginine: Positively charged. The optimists. Attract negativity (literally). Create electrostatic interactions that stabilize proteins.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Phenylalanine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine: Hydrophobic. HATE water. In an aqueous environment, they huddle together in the protein's core like people at a party who only know each other.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point is: these 20 amino acids can be arranged in ANY order and in ANY length to create proteins. And your body picks the exact right order to make each protein work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The side chains determine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whether the amino acid likes or hates water&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whether it's charged (positive, negative, or neutral)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How big it is (size matters for packing efficiency)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whether it's rigid or flexible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What chemical reactions it can participate in&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Combinatorial Explosion of Possibilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A typical protein has 200-400 amino acids. Some have thousands. Titin, the largest known protein in humans, has 34,350 amino acids. It's literally a molecular spring that provides elasticity to muscle tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's do some math that will hurt your brain:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a protein that's just 100 amino acids long, there are 20^100 possible sequences. That's 1.27 × 10^130 possible combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For reference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are about 10^80 atoms in the observable universe&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are about 10^24 stars in the observable universe&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The number of possible 100-amino-acid sequences is 10^50 times MORE than the number of atoms in the universe&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And most of those sequences? They don't fold into anything useful. They're junk. They aggregate into clumps. They get degraded by cellular quality control. Only a TINY fraction of possible sequences fold into stable, functional proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nature had to search this impossibly vast space and find the sequences that actually work. And it did this through random mutation and natural selection over 3.5 billion years. Evolution is the ultimate brute-force search algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we don't have 3.5 billion years. We want to design proteins NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Folding, The Part Where the Magic Happens (And Also Where Everything Can Go Wrong)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a ribosome finishes making a protein (remember translation from my last article?), it spits out a long, floppy, completely linear chain of amino acids. This chain is called a polypeptide, literally "many peptides" because each amino acid is connected to the next by a peptide bond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The peptide bond forms between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the next:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;...—NH—CHR—CO—NH—CHR—CO—NH—CHR—CO—...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates a backbone (the repeating NH-CHR-CO pattern) with side chains (R groups) sticking out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, immediately, while the ribosome is still finishing the rest of the chain, something magical happens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chain starts folding itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No chaperone proteins initially (those come later if needed). No instructions. No assembly manual. No quality control inspector. The amino acids just start interacting with each other based on their chemical properties, and the whole thing spontaneously collapses into a compact, functional 3D structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is called spontaneous folding or self-assembly, and it's one of the most beautiful phenomena in molecular biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Forces That Drive Folding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protein folding is driven by thermodynamics, specifically, the search for the lowest free energy state (most stable configuration). Multiple forces contribute:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. The Hydrophobic Effect (The Big One)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the primary driving force for most proteins. Hydrophobic amino acids (like leucine, valine, phenylalanine) are energetically unfavorable in water. Water molecules have to organize around them in structured "cages," which decreases entropy (disorder).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system wants to maximize entropy. So what happens? Hydrophobic amino acids cluster together in the protein's core, away from water. This releases the ordered water molecules back into the bulk solution, increasing overall entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, hydrophilic amino acids (charged and polar ones) stay on the surface, happily interacting with water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates a protein structure with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A hydrophobic core (oil-like interior)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A hydrophilic shell (water-loving exterior)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like a molecular M&amp;amp;M. Except instead of chocolate, it's biochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Hydrogen Bonds (The Backbone of Structure)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hydrogen bonds form between:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The carbonyl oxygen (C=O) and amide hydrogen (N-H) of the backbone → creates secondary structures&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Side chains with hydroxyl (-OH), amine (-NH₂), or carboxyl (-COOH) groups&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Individually, hydrogen bonds are weak (about 5% the strength of a covalent bond). But proteins have HUNDREDS of them. Collectively, they're incredibly strong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They're responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alpha helices: The backbone coils into a spiral, with hydrogen bonds between the C=O of residue n and the N-H of residue n+4. It's like a molecular spring. Very stable. Common in proteins.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Beta sheets: The backbone extends into a zigzag sheet, with hydrogen bonds between parallel or antiparallel strands. It's like a pleated paper fan. Also very stable. Also very common.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are called secondary structures, local patterns in the protein backbone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Electrostatic Interactions (Salt Bridges)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oppositely charged amino acids attract each other:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lysine (+) attracts Aspartate (-)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arginine (+) attracts Glutamate (-)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are called salt bridges or ion pairs. They're strong and help stabilize the folded structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Disulfide Bonds (The Chemical Staples)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When two cysteine residues come close together, their sulfur atoms can form a disulfide bond (S-S). This is a COVALENT bond, much stronger than the other interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disulfide bonds are like staples that hold parts of the protein together. They're especially common in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extracellular proteins (outside cells, where the environment is oxidizing)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Antibodies (which need to be stable in harsh environments)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside cells (reducing environment), disulfide bonds are rare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Van der Waals Forces (The Weak but Numerous)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When atoms get very close, they experience weak attractive forces called van der Waals interactions. They're tiny individually, but proteins have THOUSANDS of atoms in close contact, so collectively they matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6. Entropy (The Desire for Disorder)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Folding DECREASES entropy (the protein goes from a floppy, disordered chain to a compact, ordered structure). This is thermodynamically unfavorable. But remember: folding releases water molecules from around hydrophobic residues, which INCREASES entropy. The net effect? Folding is favorable overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Folding Timeline: Milliseconds to Seconds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How fast does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small proteins (50-100 amino acids) can fold in microseconds to milliseconds. Larger proteins take seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For reference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Millisecond = 10^-3 seconds&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microsecond = 10^-6 seconds&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your cells are making proteins and folding them CONSTANTLY. Every second. Right now. While you read this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's the crazy part: the folded structure is reproducible. Given the same sequence, you get the same structure. Every time. It's deterministic (mostly, there are exceptions called intrinsically disordered proteins, but let's not go there).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means the folding information is ENCODED in the amino acid sequence. The sequence contains all the instructions needed to fold into the correct shape. But humans don't know how to READ those instructions directly. We can see the sequence. We can see the final structure. But predicting one from the other? That took 50 years to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Final Product: The Native Structure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final 3D shape is called the protein's native structure. It has several levels of organization:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Primary structure: The linear sequence of amino acids. Just the order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondary structure: Local patterns (alpha helices and beta sheets).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tertiary structure: The full 3D arrangement of the entire protein chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quaternary structure: If multiple protein chains come together (like hemoglobin, which has 4 chains), how they're arranged relative to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The native structure is the functional form. This is the shape that DOES the biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is where things get critical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Shape = Function (And This Is Why Protein Folding Is Life or Death)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the most important concept in all of protein biology, and I cannot stress this enough:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A protein's function is ENTIRELY determined by its 3D shape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not the amino acid sequence. Not the chemical properties of individual residues. The three-dimensional structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change the shape even slightly, and the protein stops working. Change it drastically, and you get disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me give you examples that show just how insanely specific this is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example 1: Enzymes and the Lock-and-Key Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions. Without them, most biological reactions would happen so slowly that you'd be dead. Your cells would be frozen in chemical slow-motion. Enzymes have a specific pocket called an active site, a precisely shaped cavity where the chemical reaction happens. The substrate (the molecule the enzyme works on) fits into this pocket like a key in a lock. The fit is SPECIFIC. If the shape is even slightly wrong, the substrate won't fit. The reaction won't happen. The enzyme is useless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lactase (The Enzyme That Digests Milk Sugar)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lactase is the enzyme that breaks down lactose (milk sugar). If you're lactose intolerant, it's because your body either stopped making lactase or makes a misfolded version that doesn't work. Result? Lactose sits in your intestines. Gut bacteria ferment it. You get gas, bloating, diarrhea. One misfolded protein = digestive chaos. You can't drink milk because your protein has the wrong shape. That's how specific this is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example 2: Antibodies and Immune Recognition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your immune system has to recognize millions of different threats: viruses, bacteria, toxins, parasites. It does this with antibodies, Y-shaped proteins that bind to specific invaders. Each antibody is custom-shaped to recognize a specific molecular pattern (called an antigen) on the surface of an invader. The tips of the Y are shaped to fit that specific target. The fit is so precise that an antibody designed for the flu virus won't recognize the common cold virus. Different shapes = different antibodies needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why vaccines work. You expose your immune system to a harmless version of a pathogen, your body makes antibodies with the right shape to recognize it, and now you're protected. If the antibody shape is wrong, your immune system won't recognize the threat. You get sick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern medicine exploits this by designing custom antibodies as drugs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Herceptin: Treats breast cancer by binding to specific receptors on cancer cells&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Humira: Treats autoimmune diseases by blocking inflammatory proteins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keytruda: Unleashes your immune system to attack cancer cells&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are literally designer proteins with custom shapes targeting specific molecules. Billion-dollar drugs that work because the shape is right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example 3: Haemoglobin and the Oxygen Transport System&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haemoglobin carries oxygen in your blood. It's shaped like a four-leaf clover with pockets that hold iron atoms, which bind oxygen. The shape is critical for function. Haemoglobin picks up oxygen in your lungs (where O₂ is abundant) and releases it in your tissues (where O₂ is scarce). But if you change just ONE amino acid... Sickle Cell Anemia is caused by a single mutation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Position 6 in the beta chain of haemoglobin Glutamic acid (charged, hydrophilic) → Valine (hydrophobic)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it. One letter out of 146 amino acids in that chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But valine is hydrophobic. It creates a sticky patch on the surface of the haemoglobin molecule. When haemoglobin releases oxygen, this patch is exposed. Hydrophobic patches love to stick together. So sickle haemoglobin molecules clump together, forming long fibers. These fibers deform red blood cells into sickle (crescent) shapes. Sickled cells:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get stuck in blood vessels → pain, organ damage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Break apart easily → anemia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don't carry oxygen well&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One amino acid. One shape change. Lifelong disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example 4: Prions and the Horror of Misfolding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's where it gets truly terrifying. Prions are misfolded proteins that can convert normal proteins into the misfolded form, spreading like an infection. They cause diseases like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mad cow disease&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kuru&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fatal familial insomnia&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The protein involved is called PrP (prion protein). Everyone has it. It's a normal protein on the surface of neurons. But PrP can misfold into a different shape, same amino acid sequence, different structure. This misfolded version (PrP^Sc) is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Protease-resistant (can't be broken down)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forms aggregates (clumps together)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Converts normal PrP into the misfolded form&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's autocatalytic. Self-replicating. And it destroys brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One can get prion diseases by:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eating infected tissue (mad cow)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inheriting a mutation that makes PrP more likely to misfold (genetic)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spontaneous misfolding (sporadic, rare but it happens)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no cure. It's 100% fatal. And it's all because of protein shape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Levinthal Paradox: Why Protein Folding Should Be Impossible (But Isn't)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1969, a scientist named Cyrus Levinthal did some math and realized something disturbing: Protein folding shouldn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Math That Breaks Reality&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider a protein with 100 amino acids. Each amino acid has bonds that can rotate, and each bond has maybe 3 stable angles. So there are roughly 10^95 possible shapes the protein could adopt. Now, let's say the protein can try one shape every picosecond (10^-12 seconds). That's incredibly fast, molecular vibrations happen on that timescale. How long would it take to try all possible shapes to find the correct one? 10^83 seconds. The universe is about 10^17 seconds old. 10^83 seconds is 10^66 times longer than the age of the universe. If proteins had to randomly search for the correct fold, it would take longer than the universe has existed. But proteins fold in milliseconds. This is the Levinthal Paradox. Folding should be impossible. But it happens. Every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Answer: Proteins Don't Search Randomly&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proteins follow a folding pathway, they don't try every possible shape. They take shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a landscape with hills and valleys. The native structure is the deepest valley (lowest energy state). If the protein randomly wandered around, it would take forever to find the valley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the landscape is shaped like a funnel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The protein starts at the top (unfolded, high energy)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local interactions form (hydrophobic collapse, alpha helices, beta strands)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;These constrain the possible conformations, the protein is now halfway down the funnel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More interactions form, further stabilizing the structure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The protein slides down the funnel toward the native state&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's guided by the energy landscape encoded in the amino acid sequence. Evolution figured out sequences that fold efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nature is smarter than random searching. Who knew.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Protein Folding Problem: A 50-Year Quest&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, proteins fold into specific shapes based on their sequences. Great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what scientists wanted to do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give me an amino acid sequence (like: MKTAYIAKQRQISFVKSHF...) and I'll tell you what 3D shape it will fold into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple request. Insanely hard problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is called the protein folding problem, and it's been one of the grand challenges of biology since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Scientists Cared&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can predict protein structure from sequence, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Understand diseases: Know which mutations cause misfolding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Design drugs: Target specific pockets in disease-related proteins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Engineer enzymes: Create custom proteins with desired functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Understand evolution: See how protein structures change over time&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we couldn't do it. We tried for 50 years. And mostly failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why It's Ridiculously Hard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. The Search Space is Incomprehensibly Vast&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already covered this. 10^95 possible conformations for a 100-amino-acid protein. Even with folding pathways, the space is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. The Interactions Are Complicated&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every amino acid interacts with every other amino acid. For a 100-amino-acid protein, that's nearly 5,000 possible pairwise interactions. And they all influence each other simultaneously. It's like trying to solve a Rubik's cube where every move affects every other square in unpredictable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. You Have to Model Water&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proteins fold in water. Water molecules interact with the protein, forming hydrogen bonds, pushing hydrophobic parts inward, stabilizing charged regions. You can't model the protein in isolation. You need to simulate thousands of water molecules too. And water is WEIRD, its properties (hydrogen bonding, high dielectric constant) make it computationally expensive to model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Small Changes Have Big Effects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change one amino acid and the whole structure can change. It's not a linear relationship. The folding landscape is rugged, small mutations can shift the entire energy funnel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. It's a Physics Problem&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protein folding is governed by thermodynamics. You need to calculate the free energy of every possible conformation and find the global minimum (most stable state).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This requires simulating quantum mechanical interactions between thousands of atoms. Computationally, it's a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Early Attempts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists tried everything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;X-ray Crystallography (1950s onward):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grow protein crystals → Blast them with X-rays → X-rays diffract off the atoms → Analyze the diffraction pattern → Reconstruct the 3D structure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This WORKS, but:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Takes months (growing crystals is hard)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Requires pure protein samples&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only works for proteins that crystallize (many don't)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gives you the structure of proteins you ALREADY HAVE, not predictions for new ones&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NMR Spectroscopy (1980s onward):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put protein in a magnetic field → Use radio waves to probe the positions of atoms → Reconstruct the structure from the data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also works, but:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Limited to small proteins (&amp;lt;30 kDa)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Requires high concentrations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expensive and time-consuming&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cryo-Electron Microscopy (2010s):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flash-freeze proteins → Image them with an electron microscope → Average thousands of images to get high resolution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This revolutionized structural biology (2017 Nobel Prize) but:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Still expensive&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Still requires specialized equipment&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Still only gives you structures of existing proteins&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these methods PREDICT structures. They DETERMINE structures experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computational Approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists tried to simulate folding computationally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations: Model every atom in the protein and surrounding water → Calculate forces between atoms using physics equations → Simulate the motion of atoms over time (Newton's laws) → Watch the protein fold&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds great! Except:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's computationally INSANE&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need femtosecond timesteps (10^-15 seconds)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proteins fold in milliseconds (10^-3 seconds)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That's 10^12 timesteps to simulate one folding event&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For a medium-sized protein in water: ~100,000 atoms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modern supercomputers: days to weeks for one simulation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And even then, you might miss the correct fold or get trapped in a metastable state (local energy minimum that's not the global minimum).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rosetta (2000s):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A software developed by David Baker's lab that uses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Energy functions (estimations of how stable a given conformation is)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monte Carlo sampling (randomly try different conformations, keep the good ones)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fragment assembly (use known protein fragments as building blocks)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rosetta was better than nothing. It could sometimes predict structures for small proteins or proteins similar to known structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;CASP: The Protein Folding Olympics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1994, researchers created CASP, Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction. Every two years, teams compete to predict protein structures. Organizers choose proteins whose structures are about to be solved experimentally, teams submit predictions, and then the real structures are revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scores range from 0 to 100. Above 90 is considered competitive with experimental accuracy. For 25 years, the best scores hovered around 40-60 for difficult targets. Progress was incremental. Slow. Frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AlphaFold 1: The Warning Shot (2018)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In CASP13 (2018), a team from DeepMind (Google's AI lab) entered a protein structure prediction method called AlphaFold. It used deep learning, neural networks trained on known protein structures. AlphaFold 1 achieved a median GDT score of 58.9, placing first overall. The biology community took notice. This was the first time a machine learning approach significantly outperformed traditional methods. But it wasn't revolutionary. It was good, not great. There were still errors. Difficult targets were still difficult. Researchers thought: "Okay, AI is promising, but we're not there yet."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then came 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AlphaFold 2: The Moment Everything Changed (2020)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In November 2020, CASP14 results were announced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepMind's AlphaFold 2 achieved a median GDT score of 92.4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me put this in perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Previous best: ~60&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AlphaFold 2: 92.4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scores above 90 are considered competitive with experimental methods&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AlphaFold 2 essentially SOLVED the protein folding problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 87% of targets, it achieved GDT &amp;gt; 90. For some targets, it was MORE accurate than the experimental structures (because X-ray crystallography has its own errors).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepMind open-sourced the code and released the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, predicted structures for 200 million proteins (essentially every known protein sequence).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How AlphaFold Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proteins are like language. A protein sequence is a string of letters (amino acids). Those letters follow rules (chemistry). The structure is the "meaning" of the sequence. And modern AI is REALLY good at understanding language patterns. That's what powers large language models. AlphaFold adapted the same technology, transformers with attention mechanisms, for proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Input: Amino acid sequence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find related sequences: Search databases for similar proteins (evolution often conserves structure even when sequences change)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attention mechanism: A neural network learns relationships between amino acids, which ones are close in 3D space, which ones interact&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Structure prediction: Build the 3D coordinates based on learned patterns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Output: Predicted structure with confidence scores&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AlphaFold doesn't simulate physics. It recognizes patterns learned from 170,000+ known protein structures. And it works. Ridiculously well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But AlphaFold Wasn't Perfect. AlphaFold 2 was groundbreaking, but gaps remained:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Speed: Each prediction took hours. If you want to screen thousands of protein designs for drug discovery, that's a problem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Design: AlphaFold predicts structure from sequence. It doesn't design sequences for a desired structure. That's harder.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Novel proteins: For completely new folds (not similar to anything in training data), accuracy dropped.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dynamics: Some proteins don't have a single fixed shape, they're flexible. AlphaFold predicts one static structure. This is where NVIDIA enters the picture.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why NVIDIA?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NVIDIA makes GPUs, your Graphics Processing Units. They were originally designed for rendering video game graphics. But GPUs are incredibly good at parallel processing, doing thousands of calculations simultaneously. And guess what needs massive parallel processing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Training neural networks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running protein predictions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simulating molecular interactions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Screening thousands of drug candidates&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NVIDIA realized: the same hardware that powers gaming can power drug discovery. So they didn't just optimize AlphaFold to run faster on GPUs, they built an entire ecosystem for biological research:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BioNeMo: Language models for proteins (think GPT, but for biology)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ProteinDT: Design proteins by describing them in plain English&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;La-Proteina: Generate entirely new proteins from scratch&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ESM models: Understand protein sequences like language&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenFold optimizations: Make structure prediction 138x faster&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And they partnered with pharmaceutical giants, Pfizer, Amgen, AstraZeneca, who are using these tools to design drugs RIGHT NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How NVIDIA made protein prediction 138x faster&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BioNeMo: GPT for biology (language models trained on proteins)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ProteinDT: Designing proteins by describing them in English&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;La-Proteina &amp;amp; Proteína: Generating new proteins that have never existed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ESM models: Teaching AI to "read" protein sequences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The complete pipeline: from "I want a drug" to "here's a protein candidate"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real applications: companies using this NOW to cure diseases&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The future: personalized medicine, synthetic biology, designer organisms&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically: how gaming GPUs became the most important tool in modern drug discovery. And why this matters even if you've never thought about proteins before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part 2 coming soon. This is where things get truly wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Everything in this article is scientifically accurate. Proteins really fold in milliseconds. AlphaFold really solved a 50-year-old problem. Your gaming GPU really uses the same architecture as drug discovery platforms. Biology is weird, AI is powerful, and we're living in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
