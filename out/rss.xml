  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dario Amodei, the C.E.O. of the artificial-intelligence company Anthropic, has been predicting that an A.I. “smarter than a Nobel Prize winner” in such fields as biology, math, engineering, and writing might come online by 2027. He envisions millions of copies of a model whirring away, each conducting its own research: a “country of geniuses in a datacenter.” In June, Sam Altman, of OpenAI, wrote that the industry was on the cusp of building “digital superintelligence.” “The 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before,” he asserted. Meanwhile, the A.I. tools that most people currently interact with on a day-to-day basis are reminiscent of Clippy, the onetime Microsoft Office “assistant” that was actually more of a gadfly. A Zoom A.I. tool suggests that you ask it “What are some meeting icebreakers?” or instruct it to “Write a short message to share gratitude.” Siri is good at setting reminders but not much else. A friend of mine saw a button in Gmail that said “Thank and tell anecdote.” When he clicked it, Google’s A.I. invented a funny story about a trip to Turkey that he never took.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rushed and uneven rollout of A.I. has created a fog in which it is tempting to conclude that there is nothing to see here—that it’s all hype. There is, to be sure, plenty of hype: Amodei’s timeline is science-fictional. (A.I. models aren’t improving that fast.) But it is another kind of wishful thinking to suppose that large language models are just shuffling words around. I used to be sympathetic to that view. I sought comfort in the idea that A.I. had little to do with real intelligence or understanding. I even celebrated its shortcomings—rooting for the home team. Then I began using A.I. in my work as a programmer, fearing that if I didn’t I would fall behind. (My employer, a trading firm, has several investments in and partnerships with A.I. companies, including Anthropic.) Writing code is, by many accounts, the thing that A.I. is best at; code has more structure than prose does, and it’s often possible to automatically validate that a given program works. My conversion was swift. At first, I consulted A.I. models in lieu of looking something up. Then I gave them small, self-contained problems. Eventually, I gave them real work—the kind I’d trained my whole career to do. I saw these models digest, in seconds, the intricate details of thousands of lines of code. They could spot subtle bugs and orchestrate complex new features. Finally, I was transferred to a fast-growing team that aims to make better use of A.I. tools, and to create our own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The science-fiction author William Gibson is said to have observed that the future is already here, just not evenly distributed—which might explain why A.I. seems to have minted two cultures, one dismissive and the other enthralled. In our daily lives, A.I. “agents” that can book vacations or file taxes are a flop, but I have colleagues who compose much of their code using A.I. and sometimes run multiple coding agents at a time. Models sometimes make amateur mistakes or get caught in inane loops, but, as I’ve learned to use them effectively, they have allowed me to accomplish in an evening what used to take a month. Not too long ago, I made two iOS apps without knowing how to make an iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once had a boss who said that a job interview should probe for strengths, not for the absence of weaknesses. Large language models have many weaknesses: they famously hallucinate reasonable-sounding falsehoods; they can be servile even when you’re wrong; they are fooled by simple puzzles. But I remember a time when the obvious strengths of today’s A.I. models—fluency, fluidity, an ability to “get” what someone is talking about—were considered holy grails. When you experience these strengths firsthand, you wonder: How convincing does the illusion of understanding have to be before you stop calling it an illusion?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a brutally hot day this summer, my friend Max met up with his family at a playground. For some reason, a sprinkler for kids was switched off, and Max’s wife had promised everyone that her husband would fix it. Confronted by red-faced six- and seven-year-olds, Max entered a utility shed hoping to find a big, fat “On” switch. Instead, he found a maze of ancient pipes and valves. He was about to give up when, on a whim, he pulled out his phone and fed a photo into ChatGPT-4o, along with a description of his problem. The A.I. thought for a second, or maybe didn’t think, but all the same it said that he was looking at a backflow-preventer system typical of irrigation setups. Did he see that yellow ball valve toward the bottom? That probably controlled the flow. Max went for it, and cheers rang out across the playground as the water turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was ChatGPT mindlessly stringing words together, or did it understand the problem? The answer could teach us something important about understanding itself. “Neuroscientists have to confront this humbling truth,” Doris Tsao, a neuroscience professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told me. “The advances in machine learning have taught us more about the essence of intelligence than anything that neuroscience has discovered in the past hundred years.” Tsao is best known for decoding how macaque monkeys perceive faces. Her team learned to predict which neurons would fire when a monkey saw a specific face; even more strikingly, given a pattern of neurons firing, Tsao’s team could render the face. Their work built on research into how faces are represented inside A.I. models. These days, her favorite question to ask people is “What is the deepest insight you have gained from ChatGPT?” “My own answer,” she said, “is that I think it radically demystifies thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most basic account of how we got here goes something like this. In the nineteen-eighties, a small team of cognitive psychologists and computer scientists tried to simulate thinking in a machine. Among the more famous of them were David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and James McClelland, who went on to form a research group at U.C. San Diego. They saw the brain as a vast network in which neurons fire in patterns, causing other sets of neurons to fire, and so on; this dance of patterns is thinking. The brain learns by changing the strength of the connections between neurons. Crucially, the scientists mimicked this process by creating an artificial neural network, and by applying a simple algorithm called gradient descent to increase the accuracy of its predictions. (The algorithm could be compared to a hiker navigating from a mountaintop to a valley; a simple strategy for eventually finding one’s way is to insure that every step moves downhill.) The use of such algorithms in large networks is known as deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other people in A.I. were skeptical that neural networks were sophisticated enough for real-world tasks, but, as the networks got bigger, they began to solve previously unsolvable problems. People would devote entire dissertations to developing techniques for distinguishing handwritten digits or for recognizing faces in images; then a deep-learning algorithm would digest the underlying data, discover the subtleties of the problem, and make those projects seem obsolete. Deep learning soon conquered speech recognition, translation, image captioning, board games, and even the problem of predicting how proteins will fold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s leading A.I. models are trained on a large portion of the internet, using a technique called next-token prediction. A model learns by making guesses about what it will read next, then comparing those guesses to whatever actually appears. Wrong guesses inspire changes in the connection strength between the neurons; this is gradient descent. Eventually, the model becomes so good at predicting text that it appears to know things and make sense. So that is something to think about. A group of people sought the secret of how the brain works. As their model grew toward a brain-like size, it started doing things that were thought to require brain-like intelligence. Is it possible that they found what they were looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is understandable resistance to such a simplistic and triumphant account of A.I. The case against it was well argued by Ted Chiang, who wrote an article for this magazine in early 2023 titled “ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web.” He meant it in a more or less deflationary way: that’s all ChatGPT is. You feed the whole internet to a program and it regurgitates it back to you imperfectly, like a copy of a copy of a photograph—but with just enough facility to fool you into believing that the program is intelligent. This spring, a similar argument was made in a book, “The AI Con,” by Emily M. Bender, a linguist, and Alex Hanna, a sociologist. Bender is perhaps best known for describing L.L.M.s as “stochastic parrots.” “Large language models do not, cannot, and will not ‘understand’ anything at all,” the writer Tyler Austin Harper declared in a book review in The Atlantic. Models “produce writing not by thinking but by making statistically informed guesses about which lexical item is likely to follow another.” Harper buttressed these technical arguments with moral ones. A.I. enriches the powerful, consumes enough energy to accelerate climate change, and marginalizes workers. He concluded that “the foundation of the AI industry is a scam.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the moral case against A.I. may ultimately be stronger than the technical one. “The ‘stochastic parrot’ thing has to be dead at some point,” Samuel J. Gershman, a Harvard cognitive scientist who is no A.I. hype man, told me. “Only the most hardcore skeptics can deny these systems are doing things many of us didn’t think were going to be achieved.” Jonathan Cohen, a cognitive neuroscientist at Princeton, emphasized the limitations of A.I., but argued that, in some cases, L.L.M.s seem to mirror one of the largest and most important parts of the human brain. “To a first approximation, your neocortex is your deep-learning mechanism,” Cohen said. Humans have a much larger neocortex than other animals, relative to body size, and the species with the largest neocortices—elephants, dolphins, gorillas, chimpanzees, dogs—are among the most intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2003, the machine-learning researcher Eric B. Baum published a book called “What Is Thought?” (I stumbled upon it in my college’s library stacks, drawn by the title.) The gist of Baum’s argument is that understanding is compression, and compression is understanding. In statistics, when you want to make sense of points on a graph, you can use a technique called linear regression to draw a “line of best fit” through them. If there’s an underlying regularity in the data—maybe you’re plotting shoe size against height—the line of best fit will efficiently express it, predicting where new points could fall. The neocortex can be understood as distilling a sea of raw experience—sounds, sights, and other sensations—into “lines of best fit,” which it can use to make predictions. A baby exploring the world tries to guess how a toy will taste or where food will go when it hits the floor. When a prediction is wrong, the connections between neurons are adjusted. Over time, those connections begin to capture regularities in the data. They form a compressed model of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks compress experience just like real neural networks do. One of the best open-source A.I. models, DeepSeek, is capable of writing novels, suggesting medical diagnoses, and sounding like a native speaker in dozens of languages. It was trained using next-token prediction on many terabytes of data. But when you download the model it is one six-hundredth of that. A distillation of the internet, compressed to fit on your laptop. Ted Chiang was right to call an early version of ChatGPT a blurry JPEG of the web—but, in my view, this is the very reason these models have become increasingly intelligent. Chiang noted in his piece that, to compress a text file filled with millions of examples of arithmetic, you wouldn’t create a zip file. You’d write a calculator program. “The greatest degree of compression can be achieved by understanding the text,” he wrote. Perhaps L.L.M.s are starting to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can seem unnatural, even repulsive, to imagine that a computer program actually understands, actually thinks. We usually conceptualize thinking as something conscious, like a Joycean inner monologue or the flow of sense memories in a Proustian daydream. Or we might mean reasoning: working through a problem step by step. In our conversations about A.I., we often conflate these different kinds of thinking, and it makes our judgments pat. ChatGPT is obviously not thinking, goes one argument, because it is obviously not having a Proustian reverie; ChatGPT clearly is thinking, goes another, because it can work through logic puzzles better than you can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something more subtle is going on. I do not believe that ChatGPT has an inner life, and yet it seems to know what it’s talking about. Understanding—having a grasp of what’s going on—is an underappreciated kind of thinking, because it’s mostly unconscious. Douglas Hofstadter, a professor of cognitive science and comparative literature at Indiana University, likes to say that cognition is recognition. Hofstadter became famous for a book about the mind and consciousness called “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid,” which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980. Hofstadter’s theory, developed through decades of research, is that “seeing as” is the essence of thinking. You see one patch of color as a car and another as a key chain; you recognize the letter “A” no matter what font it is written in or how bad the handwriting might be. Hofstadter argued that the same process underlies more abstract kinds of perception. When a grand master examines a chess board, years of practice are channelled into a way of seeing: white’s bishop is weak; that endgame is probably a draw. You see an eddy in a river as a sign that it’s dangerous to cross. You see a meeting you’re in as an emperor-has-no-clothes situation. My nearly two-year-old son recognizes that late-morning stroller walks might be an opportunity for a croissant and makes demands accordingly. For Hofstadter, that’s intelligence in a nutshell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hofstadter was one of the original A.I. deflationists, and my own skepticism was rooted in his. He wrote that most A.I. research had little to do with real thinking, and when I was in college, in the two-thousands, I agreed with him. There were exceptions. He found the U.C.S.D. group interesting. And he admired the work of a lesser-known Finnish American cognitive scientist, Pentti Kanerva, who noticed some unusual properties in the mathematics of high-dimensional spaces. In a high-dimensional space, any two random points may be extremely far apart. But, counterintuitively, each point also has a large cloud of neighbors around it, so you can easily find your way to it if you get “close enough.” That reminded Kanerva of the way that memory works. In a 1988 book called “Sparse Distributed Memory,” Kanerva argued that thoughts, sensations, and recollections could be represented as coördinates in high-dimensional space. The brain seemed like the perfect piece of hardware for storing such things. Every memory has a sort of address, defined by the neurons that are active when you recall it. New experiences cause new sets of neurons to fire, representing new addresses. Two addresses can be different in many ways but similar in others; one perception or memory triggers other memories nearby. The scent of hay recalls a memory of summer camp. The first three notes of Beethoven’s Fifth beget the fourth. A chess position that you’ve never seen reminds you of old games—not all of them, just the ones in the right neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hofstadter realized that Kanerva was describing something like a “seeing as” machine. “Pentti Kanerva’s memory model was a revelation for me,” he wrote in a foreword to Kanerva’s book. “It was the very first piece of research I had ever run across that made me feel I could glimpse the distant goal of understanding how the brain works as a whole.” Every kind of thinking—whether Joycean, Proustian, or logical—depends on the relevant thing coming to mind at the right time. It’s how we figure out what situation we’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kanerva’s book receded from view, and Hofstadter’s own star faded—except when he occasionally poked up his head to criticize a new A.I. system. In 2018, he wrote of Google Translate and similar technologies: “There is still something deeply lacking in the approach, which is conveyed by a single word: understanding.” But GPT-4, which was released in 2023, produced Hofstadter’s conversion moment. “I’m mind-boggled by some of the things that the systems do,” he told me recently. “It would have been inconceivable even only ten years ago.” The staunchest deflationist could deflate no longer. Here was a program that could translate as well as an expert, make analogies, extemporize, generalize. Who were we to say that it didn’t understand? “They do things that are very much like thinking,” he said. “You could say they are thinking, just in a somewhat alien way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;L.L.M.s appear to have a “seeing as” machine at their core. They represent each word with a series of numbers denoting its coördinates—its vector—in a high-dimensional space. In GPT-4, a word vector has thousands of dimensions, which describe its shades of similarity to and difference from every other word. During training, a large language model tweaks a word’s coördinates whenever it makes a prediction error; words that appear in texts together are nudged closer in space. This produces an incredibly dense representation of usages and meanings, in which analogy becomes a matter of geometry. In a classic example, if you take the word vector for “Paris,” subtract “France,” and then add “Italy,” the nearest other vector will be “Rome.” L.L.M.s can “vectorize” an image by encoding what’s in it, its mood, even the expressions on people’s faces, with enough detail to redraw it in a particular style or to write a paragraph about it. When Max asked ChatGPT to help him out with the sprinkler at the park, the model wasn’t just spewing text. The photograph of the plumbing was compressed, along with Max’s prompt, into a vector that captured its most important features. That vector served as an address for calling up nearby words and concepts. Those ideas, in turn, called up others as the model built up a sense of the situation. It composed its response with those ideas “in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I was reading an interview with an Anthropic researcher, Trenton Bricken, who has worked with colleagues to probe the insides of Claude, the company’s series of A.I. models. (Their research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal.) His team has identified ensembles of artificial neurons, or “features,” that activate when Claude is about to say one thing or another. Features turn out to be like volume knobs for concepts; turn them up and the model will talk about little else. (In a sort of thought-control experiment, the feature representing the Golden Gate Bridge was turned up; when one user asked Claude for a chocolate-cake recipe, its suggested ingredients included “1/4 cup dry fog” and “1 cup warm seawater.”) In the interview, Bricken mentioned Google’s Transformer architecture, a recipe for constructing neural networks that underlies leading A.I. models. (The “T” in ChatGPT stands for “Transformer.”) He argued that the mathematics at the heart of the Transformer architecture closely approximated a model proposed decades earlier—by Pentti Kanerva, in “Sparse Distributed Memory.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should we be surprised by the correspondence between A.I. and our own brains? L.L.M.s are, after all, artificial neural networks that psychologists and neuroscientists helped develop. What’s more surprising is that when models practiced something rote—predicting words—they began to behave in such a brain-like way. These days, the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence are becoming entangled; brain experts are using A.I. as a kind of model organism. Evelina Fedorenko, a neuroscientist at M.I.T., has used L.L.M.s to study how brains process language. “I never thought I would be able to think about these kinds of things in my lifetime,” she told me. “I never thought we’d have models that are good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has become commonplace to say that A.I. is a black box, but the opposite is arguably true: a scientist can probe the activity of individual artificial neurons and even alter them. “Having a working system that instantiates a theory of human intelligence—it’s the dream of cognitive neuroscience,” Kenneth Norman, a Princeton neuroscientist, told me. Norman has created computer models of the hippocampus, the brain region where episodic memories are stored, but in the past they were so simple that he could only feed them crude approximations of what might enter a human mind. “Now you can give memory models the exact stimuli you give to a person,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Wright brothers studied birds during their early efforts to build an airplane. They noted that birds take off into the wind, even though a reasonable person might have assumed they’d want the wind at their backs, and that they warp the tips of their wings for balance. These findings influenced their rudimentary glider designs. Then they built a six-foot-long wind tunnel, which allowed them to test a set of artificial wings under precisely controlled conditions. Their next round of glider flights was far more successful. Strangely, it was only well after they’d made a working flying machine that it became possible to understand exactly how the birds do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A.I. enables scientists to place thinking itself in a wind tunnel. For a paper provocatively titled “On the Biology of a Large Language Model,” Anthropic researchers observed Claude responding to queries and described “circuits”—cascades of features that, together, perform complex computations. (Calling up the right memories is one step toward thinking; combining and manipulating them in circuits is arguably another.) One longstanding criticism of L.L.M.s has been that, because they must generate one token of their response at a time, they can’t plan or reason. But, when you ask Claude to finish a rhyming couplet in a poem, a circuit begins considering the last word of the new line, to insure that it will rhyme. It then works backward to compose the line as a whole. Anthropic researchers counted this as evidence that their models do engage in planning. Squint a little and you might feel, for the first time, that the inner workings of a mind are in view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You really do have to squint, though. “The worry I have is that people flipped the bit from ‘I’m really skeptical of this’ to totally dropping their shields,” Norman, the Princeton neuroscientist, told me. “Many things still have to get figured out.” I’m one of the people that Norman is talking about. (Perhaps I am too easily moved by the seeming convergence of “Sparse Distributed Memory” and an Anthropic model.) In the past year or two, I started to believe what Geoffrey Hinton, who recently won a Nobel Prize for his A.I. research, told the journalist Karen Hao in 2020: “Deep learning is going to be able to do everything.” But we have also seen that larger models aren’t always better models. Curves plotting model performance against size have begun flattening out. It’s becoming difficult to find high-quality data that the models haven’t already digested, and computing power is increasingly expensive. When GPT-5 came out, in August, it was a merely incremental improvement—and so profound a disappointment that it threatened to pop the A.I. investment bubble. The moment demands a middle kind of skepticism: one that takes today’s A.I. models seriously without believing that there are no hard problems left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most consequential of these problems is how to design a model that learns as efficiently as humans do. It is estimated that GPT-4 was exposed to trillions of words in training; children need only a few million to become fluent. Cognitive scientists tell us that a newborn’s brain has certain “inductive biases” that accelerate learning. (Of course, the brain is the result of millions of years of evolution—itself a sort of training data.) For instance, human babies have the expectation that the world is made of objects, and that other beings have beliefs and intentions. When Mama says “banana,” an infant connects that word to the entire yellow object she’s looking at—not just its tip or its peel. Infants perform little experiments: Can I eat this? How far can I throw that? They are motivated by emotions such as desire, curiosity, and frustration. Children are always trying to do something just beyond their ability. Their learning is efficient because it’s embodied, adaptive, deliberate, and continuous. Maybe truly understanding the world requires participating in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An A.I.’s experience, in comparison, is so impoverished that it can’t really be called “experience.” Large language models are trained on data that is already extraordinarily refined. “I think the reason they work is that they’re piggybacking on language,” Tsao, the U.C. Berkeley neuroscientist, told me. Language is like experience pre-chewed; other kinds of data are less dense with meaning. “Why is it that we haven’t had a comparable revolution in terms of reasoning about video data?” Gershman, the Harvard cognitive scientist, asked. “The kinds of vision models that we have still struggle with common-sense reasoning about physics.” A recent model from DeepMind can generate videos in which paints are mixed correctly and mazes are solved—but they also depict a glass bouncing, instead of shattering, and ropes defying physics by being smooshed into a knot. Ida Momennejad, a cognitive neuroscientist who now works for Microsoft Research, has done experiments in which an L.L.M. is given a virtual walk-through of a building and then asked questions about routes and shortcuts—spatial inferences that come easily to humans. With all but the most basic setups, the A.I.s tend to fail or hallucinate nonexistent paths. “Do they really do planning?” she said. “Not really.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my conversations with neuroscientists, I sensed a concern that the A.I. industry is racing ahead somewhat thoughtlessly. If the goal is to make artificial minds as capable as human minds are, then “we’re not training the systems in the right way,” Brenden M. Lake, a cognitive scientist at Princeton, told me. When an A.I. is done training, the neural network’s “brain” is frozen. If you tell the model some facts about yourself, it doesn’t rewire its neurons. Instead, it uses a crude substitute: it writes down a bit of text—“The user has a toddler and is studying French”—and considers that before other instructions you give. The human brain updates itself continuously, and there’s a beautiful theory about one of its ways of doing so: when you sleep, selected snapshots from your episodic memory are replayed for your neocortex in order to train it. Your high-dimensional thought space gets dimpled by the replayed memories; you wake up with a slightly new way of seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The A.I. community has become so addicted to—and so financially invested in—breakneck progress that it sometimes pretends that advancement is inevitable and there’s no science left to do. Science has the inconvenient property of sometimes stalling out. Silicon Valley may call A.I. companies “labs,” and some employees there “researchers,” but fundamentally it has an engineering culture that does whatever works. “It’s just so remarkable how little the machine-learning community bothers looking at, let alone respects, the history and cognitive science that precedes it,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s A.I. models owe their success to decades-old discoveries about the brain, but they are still deeply unlike brains. Which differences are incidental and which are fundamental? Every group of neuroscientists has its pet theory. These theories can be put to the test in a way that wasn’t possible before. Still, no one expects easy answers. The problems that continue to plague A.I. models “are solved by carefully identifying ways in which the models don’t behave as intelligently as we want them to and then addressing them,” Norman said. “That is still a human-scientist-in-the-loop process.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the nineties, billions of dollars poured into the Human Genome Project on the assumption that sequencing DNA might solve medicine’s most vexing problems: cancer, hereditary conditions, even aging. It was a time of bluster and confidence—the era of Dolly the cloned sheep and “Jurassic Park”—when biotech was ascendant and the commentariat reckoned with whether humans should be playing God. Biologists soon found that the reality was more complicated. We didn’t cure cancer or discover the causes of Alzheimer’s or autism. We learned that DNA tells just one part of the story of life. In fact, one could argue that biology got swept up in a kind of gene fever, fixating on DNA because we had the means to study and understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, nobody would claim that Francis Crick was wrong when, on the day in 1953 that he helped confirm the structure of DNA, he walked into a Cambridge pub talking about having discovered the secret of life. He and his colleagues did more to demystify life than almost anyone, ever. The decades following their discovery were among the most productive and exciting in the history of science. DNA became a household term; every high schooler learns about the double helix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With A.I., we once again find ourselves in a moment of bluster and confidence. Sam Altman talks about raising half a trillion dollars to build Stargate, a new cluster of A.I. data centers, in the U.S. People discuss the race for superintelligence with a gravitas and an urgency that can seem ungrounded, even silly. But I suspect the reason that the Amodeis and Altmans of the world are making messianic pronouncements is that they believe that the basic picture of intelligence has been worked out; the rest is just details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even some neuroscientists believe that a crucial threshold has been crossed. “I really think it could be the right model for cognition,” Uri Hasson, a colleague of Cohen’s, Norman’s, and Lake’s at Princeton, said of neural networks. This upsets him as much as it excites him. “I have the opposite worry of most people,” he said. “My worry is not that these models are similar to us. It’s that we are similar to these models.” If simple training techniques can enable a program to behave like a human, maybe humans aren’t as special as we thought. Could it also mean that A.I. will surpass us not only in knowledge but also in judgment, ingenuity, cunning—and, as a result, power? To my surprise, Hasson told me that he is “worried these days that we might succeed in understanding how the brain works. Pursuing this question may have been a colossal mistake for humanity.” He likened A.I. researchers to nuclear scientists in the nineteen-thirties: “This is the most interesting time in the life of these people. And, at the same time, they know that what they are working on has grave implications for humanity. But they cannot stop because of the curiosity to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite books by Hofstadter is a nerdy volume called “Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.” When I was in college, it electrified me. The premise was that a question such as “What is thinking?” was not merely philosophical but, rather, had a real answer. In 1995, when the book was published, Hofstadter and his research group could only gesture at what the answer might be. Thinking back on the book, I wondered whether Hofstadter would feel excited that A.I. researchers may have attained what he had yearned for: a mechanical account of the rudiments of thinking. When we spoke, however, he sounded profoundly disappointed—and frightened. Current A.I. research “confirms a lot of my ideas, but it also takes away from the beauty of what humanity is,” he told me. “When I was younger, much younger, I wanted to know what underlay creativity, the mechanisms of creativity. That was a holy grail for me. But now I want it to remain a mystery.” Perhaps the secrets of thinking are simpler than anyone expected—the kind of thing that a high schooler, or even a machine, could understand. ♦&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Lead image: Philip Goldstein) – In the early 1960s the New York City Fire Department was facing a host of problems. The world around them was growing ever taller, ever more compact, and ever more dangerous with respect to fire. There were times when the very infrastructure that was supposed to be supplying them the water to extinguish a blaze simply stopped flowing, there were other times that the equipment they had proved to be woefully insufficient to stop a fire that should have been controlled, resulting in massive blazes that ate up homes, businesses, lives, and millions upon millions of dollars. In April of 1963, a massive fire on Staten Island taxed the city’s fire service to the absolute breaking point while destroying millions and millions in property.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The day is still referred to as Black Saturday by the people who lived through it. Due to the lack of suitable water supplies, the fire was far larger than it should have been. There was a drought that year and many of the sources that the firemen were used to pulling water from had literally run dry. This began a series of events that led to the construction of the most powerful land based fire fighting truck ever created, the Mack Super Pumper System. It was actually five trucks that worked as a brigade to battle the worst flaming disasters that the city could throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From 1965 through the early 1980s, the Mack Super Pumper System responded to more than 2,200 calls with more than 900 firefighters serving to operate it in some capacity. The five trucks that made up the super pumper system were a massive, locomotive-engined central pumping truck, a tender truck full of hoses, manifolds, and other gear, and three satellite trucks that looked like standard fire engines but were not equipped with their own pumps. It cost the city of New York $875,000 when it was new and we’ll wager to say that it was probably the best money ever spent to keep Gotham safe. There’s never been anything else like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pumping unit –&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The keystone of the whole operation was the massive central pumping unit that could draw water from eight hydrants at once, drop lines into bodies of water, supply a mind-boggling number of lines with water simultaneously, and flow over 10,000 gallons per minute at low pressures if the situation called for it. When the pressure was ramped up to to 350psi, it could move 8,800 GPM. This was enough to supply the other satellite trucks as well as feed a massive water cannon on the tender truck that could heave water over 600ft. That’s right, nearly and eight of a mile in whatever direction you wanted it to go. How was this possible? It was possible because of innovations in diesel engine technology during WWII. The grunt for the Super Pumper system came from a Napier-Deltic diesel engine. This was an engine designed by the British during WWII as a lightweight, high speed means to propel their ships. Making 2,400 horsepower and even more prodigious torque numbers, the engine was “light” enough to be mounted in a trailer behind a tractor and carted around. The Napier-Deltic was used to power locomotives and other massive land craft as well for a while. The engine’s design is interesting in the fact that it had three crankshafts and was an opposed piston style engine meaning that the pistons travel at each other. With turbochargers and a two stroke design, it was as mighty a compact piston powered engine the world had ever known to that point. It was thirsty and noisy as well. When working at full song, the engine would consume 137 gallons of diesel fuel per hour and the noise was so deafening that firemen near the truck had to wear strong ear protection to prevent hearing damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mack was awarded the contract to build the truck in 1964 and by the end of the year, the unit was nearly ready to hit the streets of NYC. The tractor employed to drag the pumping unit around was a F715FSTP cab over that used a 255hp Mack END864 engine. The top speed of the whole rig was 42mph but since it was intended for responding to calls in the city, high mph was not as much a concern as maneuverability, and the ability to zip around at lower speeds happily. There were custom built PTOs to power the priming pump for the water pump and to to run an air compressor that needed 450psi to light off the pump engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The custom built trailer housed the engine and all of the stuff needed to keep it alive like the cooling system, fuel tanks, etc. At the rear of the trailer was the enormous six stage pump which was built by a company called DeLaval and that’s where the real magic happened. When the big Deltic was put to work turning that bad boy, fire, at least any on the first 60 stories of a building, didn’t stand a chance. The whole rig weighed in at 68,000lbs and for as much reading and research as we have done, there are no accounts of it ever faltering, failing, or leaving firefighters without the resources they needed to battle a fire. Often times we read about awesome machines like this and discover that they were unreliable or prone to fail but not this big guy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some pretty stunning facts about the truck and the pumper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 8,800 GPM it was throwing nearly 70,000lbs of water on a fire per minute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a fire in the Bronx, firemen laid 7,000ft of hose to get to a suitable water supply and the truck pumped as though it was dipping its feet into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1967 the Super Pumper responded to a fire at a postal annex in NYC and managed to supply water to the massive gun on the tender truck, its three satellite units, two tower ladder trucks, and a portable manifold with multiple hand lines all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hoses on the truck were pressure tested to 1,000psi of pressure but typically operated anywhere in the 350-800psi range depending on the situation. This is way higher (by several times!) what modern trucks use by our understanding. The hoses were a derivative of hoses developed by the Navy in WWII for high pressure applications and while incredibly heavy when compared to modern hoses, they were cutting edge at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The truck still exists, living at a museum in Michigan and standing as a great reminder that human beings are amazingly inventive and creative beings when forced to find solutions to problems that endanger lots of lives or lots of valuable property!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your computer modem screeches as it tries to connect to something called the internet. Maybe it works. Maybe you try again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time in history, you can exchange letters with someone across the world in seconds. Only 2000-something websites exist1, so you could theoretically visit them all over a weekend. Most websites are just text on gray backgrounds with the occasional pixelated image2. Loading times are brutal. A single image takes a minute, a 1-minute video could take hours. Most people do not trust putting their credit cards online. The advice everyone gives: don’t trust strangers on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People split into two camps very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optimists predict grand transformations. Some believe digital commerce will overtake physical retail within years. Others insist we’ll wander around in virtual reality worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I expect that within the next five years more than one in ten people will wear head-mounted computer displays while traveling in buses, trains, and planes.” - Nicholas Negroponte, MIT Professor, 1993&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pessimists call the internet a fad and a bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you told the average person in 1995 that within 25 years, we’d consume news from strangers on social media over newspapers, watch shows on-demand in place of cable TV, find romantic partners through apps more than through friends, and flip “don’t trust strangers on the internet” so completely that we’d let internet strangers pick us up in their personal vehicles and sleep in their spare bedrooms, most people would find that hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re in 1995 again. This time with Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And both sides of today’s debate are making similar mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One side warns that AI will eliminate entire professions and cause mass unemployment within a couple of years. The other claims that AI will create more jobs than it destroys. One camp dismisses AI as overhyped vaporware destined for a bubble burst, while the other predicts it will automate every knowledge task and reshape civilization within the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both are part right and part wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Employment Paradox: Why Automation’s Impact Depends On The Industry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Hinton, who some call the Father of AI, warned in 2016 that AI would trigger mass unemployment. “People should stop training radiologists now,” he declared, certain that AI would replace them within years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet as Deena Mousa, a researcher, shows in “The Algorithm Will See You Now,” AI hasn’t replaced radiologists, despite predictions. It is thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 2025, American diagnostic radiology residency programs offered a record 1,208 positions across all radiology specialties, a four percent increase from 2024, and the field’s vacancy rates are at all-time highs. In 2025, radiology was the second-highest-paid medical specialty in the country, with an average income of $520,000, over 48 percent higher than the average salary in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mousa identifies a few factors for why the prediction failed - real-world complexity, the job involves more than image recognition, and regulatory/insurance hurdles. Most critical she points is Jevons Paradox, which is the economic principle that a technological improvement in resource efficiency leads to an increase in the total consumption of that resource, rather than a decrease. Her argument is that as AI makes radiologists more productive, better diagnostics and faster turnaround at lower costs mean more people get scans. So employment doesn’t decrease. It increases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also the Tech world’s consensus. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella agrees, as does Box CEO Aaron Levie, who suggests:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The least understood yet most important concept in the world is Jevons Paradox. When we make a technology more efficient, demand goes well beyond the original level. AI is the perfect example of this—almost anything that AI is applied to will see more demand, not less.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re only half right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, as Andrej Karpathy, the computer scientist who coined the term vibe coding, points out, radiology is not the right job to look for initial job displacements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Radiology is too multi-faceted, too high risk, too regulated. When looking for jobs that will change a lot due to AI on shorter time scales, I’d look in other places - jobs that look like repetition of one rote task, each task being relatively independent, closed (not requiring too much context), short (in time), forgiving (the cost of mistake is low), and of course automatable giving current (and digital) capability. Even then, I’d expect to see AI adopted as a tool at first, where jobs change and refactor (e.g. more monitoring or supervising than manual doing, etc).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the tech consensus that we will see increased employment actually depends on the industry. Specifically, how much unfulfilled demand can be unlocked in that industry, and whether this unfulfilled demand growth outpaces continued automation and productivity improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand this better, look at what actually happened in three industries over a 200-year period from 1800 to 2000. In the paper Automation and jobs: when technology boosts employment, James Bessen, an economist, shows the employment, productivity, and demand data for textile, iron &amp;amp; steel, and motor vehicle industries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After automation, both textile and iron/steel workers saw employment increase for nearly a century before experiencing a steep decline. Vehicle manufacturing, by contrast, holds steady and hasn’t seen the same steep decline yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer why those two industries saw sharp declines but motor vehicle manufacturing did not, first look at the productivity of workers in all three industries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then look at the demand across those three industries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the graphs show is a consistent pattern (note: the productivity and demand graphs are logarithmic, meaning productivity and demand grew exponentially). Early on, a service or product is expensive because many workers are needed to produce it. Most people can’t afford it or use them sparingly. For example, in the early 1800s, most people could only afford a pair of pants or shirt. Then automation makes workers dramatically more productive. A textile worker in 1900 could produce fifty times more than one in 1800. This productivity explosion crashes prices, which creates massive new demand. Suddenly everyone can afford multiple outfits instead of just one or two. Employment and productivity both surge (note: employment growth masks internal segment displacement and wage changes. See footnote3)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once demand saturates, employment doesn’t further increase but holds steady at peak demand. But as automation continues and workers keep getting more productive, employment starts to decline. In textiles, mechanization enabled massive output growth but ultimately displaced workers once consumption plateaued while automation and productivity continued climbing. We probably don’t need infinite clothing. Similarly, patients will likely never need a million radiology reports, no matter how cheap they become and so radiologists will eventually hit a ceiling. We don’t need infinite food, clothing, tax returns, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motor vehicles, in Bessen’s graphs, tell a different story because demand remains far from saturated. Most people globally still don’t own cars. Automation hasn’t completely conquered manufacturing either (Tesla’s retreat from full manufacturing automation proves the current technical limits). When both demand and automation potential remain high, employment can sustain or even grow despite productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software presents an even more interesting question. How many apps do you need? What about software that generates applications on demand, that creates entire software ecosystems autonomously? Until now, handcrafted software was the constraint. Expensive software engineers and their labor costs limited what companies could afford to build. Automation changes this equation by making those engineers far more productive. Both consumer and enterprise software markets suggest significant unmet demand because businesses have consistently left projects unbuilt4. They couldn’t justify the development costs or had to allocate limited resources to their top priority projects. I saw this firsthand at Amazon. Thousands of ideas went unfunded not because they lacked business value, but because of the lack of engineering resources to build them. If AI can produce software at a fraction of the cost, that unleashes enormous latent demand. The key question then is if and when that demand will saturate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So to generalize, for each industry, employment hinges on a race between two forces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The magnitude and growth of unmet market demand, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether that demand growth outpaces productivity improvements from automation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different industries will experience different outcomes depending on who’s winning that demand and productivity race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Bubble: Irrational Exuberance Builds the Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second debate centers on whether this AI boom is a bubble waiting to burst.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dotcom boom of the 1990s saw a wave of companies adding “.com” to their name to ride the mania and watch their valuations soar. Infra companies poured billions into fiber optics and undersea cables - expensive projects only possible because people believed the hype5. All of this eventually burst in spectacular fashion in the dotcom crash in 2000-2001. Infrastructure companies like Cisco briefly became the most valuable in the world only to come tumbling down6. Pets.com served as the poster child of this exuberance raising $82.5 million in its IPO, spending millions on a Super Bowl ad only to collapse nine months later7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the dotcom bubble also got several things right. More importantly, it eventually bought us the physical infrastructure that made YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook possible. Sure, companies like Worldcom, NorthPoint, and Global Crossing making these investments went bankrupt, but they also laid the foundation for the future. Although the crash proved the skeptics right in the short term, it proved the optimists were directionally correct in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s AI boom shows similar exuberance. Consider the AI startup founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, which raised $2 billion at a $10 billion valuation, the largest seed round in history8. This despite having no product and declining to reveal what it’s building or how it will generate returns. Several AI wrappers have raised millions in seed funding with little to no moat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet some investments will outlast the hype and will likely help future AI companies even if this is a bubble. For example, the annual capital expenditures of Hyperscalers9 that have more than doubled since ChatGPT’s release - Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon are collectively spending almost half a trillion dollars on data centers, chips, and compute infrastructure. Regardless of which specific companies survive, this infrastructure being built now will create the foundation for our AI future - from inference capacity to the power generation needed to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The infrastructure investments may have long-term value, but are we already in bubble territory? Azeem Azhar, a tech analyst and investor, provides an excellent practical framework to answer the AI bubble question. He benchmarks today’s AI boom using five gauges: economic strain (investment as a share of GDP), industry strain (capex to revenue ratios), revenue growth trajectories (doubling time), valuation heat (price-to-earnings multiples), and funding quality (the resilience of capital sources). His analysis shows that AI remains in a demand-led boom rather than a bubble, but if two of the five gauges head into red, we will be in bubble territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The demand is real. After all OpenAI is one of the fastest-growing companies in history10. But that alone doesn’t prevent bubbles. OpenAI will likely be fine given its product-market fit, but many other AI companies face the same unit economics questions that plagued dotcom companies in the 1990s. Pets.com had millions of users too (a then large portion of internet users), but as the tech axiom goes, you can acquire infinite customers and generate infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85 cents11. So despite the demand, the pattern may rhyme with the 1990s. Expect overbuilding. Expect some spectacular failures. But also expect the infrastructure to outlast the hype cycle and enable things we can’t yet imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Predictably Unpredictable Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re early in the AI revolution. We’re at that metaphorical screeching modem phase of the internet era. Just as infrastructure companies poured billions into fiber optics, hyperscalers now pour billions into compute. Startups add “.ai” to their names like companies once added “.com” as they seek higher valuations. The hype will cycle through both euphoria and despair. Some predictions will look laughably wrong. Some that seem crazy will prove conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different industries will experience different outcomes. Unlike what the Jevons optimists suggest, demand for many things plateaus once human needs are met. Employment outcomes in any industry depend on the magnitude and growth of unmet market demand and whether that demand growth outpaces productivity improvements from automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost reduction will unlock market segments. Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor, (in)famously undervalued Uber assuming it would only capture a portion of the existing taxi market12. He missed that making rides dramatically cheaper would expand the market itself as people took Ubers to destinations they’d never have paid taxi prices to reach. AI will similarly enable products and services currently too expensive to build with human intelligence. A restaurant owner might use AI to create custom supply chain software that say at $100,000 with human developers would never have been built. A non-profit might deploy AI to contest a legal battle that was previously unaffordable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can predict change, but we can’t predict the details. No one in 1995 predicted we’d date strangers from the internet, ride in their ubers, or sleep in their airbnbs. Or that a job called influencers would become the most sought-after career among young people. Human creativity generates outcomes we can’t forecast with our current mental models. Expect new domains and industries to emerge. AI has already helped us decode more animal communication in the last five years than in the last fifty. Can we predict what jobs a technology that allows us to have full-blown conversations with them will unlock? A job that doesn’t exist today will likely be the most sought-after job in 2050. We can’t name it because it hasn’t been invented yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Job categories will transform. Even as the internet made some jobs obsolete, it also transformed others and created new categories. Expect the same with AI. Karpathy ends with a question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;About 6 months ago, I was also asked to vote if we will have less or more software engineers in 5 years. Exercise left for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer this question, go back to 1995 and ask the same question but with journalists. You might have predicted more journalists because the internet would create more demand by enabling you to reach the whole world. You’d be right for 10 or so years as employment in journalism grew until the early 2000s. But 30 years later, the number of newspapers and the number of journalists both have declined, even though more “journalism” happens than ever. Just not by people we call journalists. Bloggers, influencers, YouTubers, and newsletter writers do the work that traditional journalists used to do13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same pattern will play out with software engineers. We’ll see more people doing software engineering work and in a decade or so, what “software engineer” means will have transformed. Consider the restaurant owner from earlier who uses AI to create custom inventory software that is useful only for them. They won’t call themselves a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So just like in 1995, if the AI optimists today say that within 25 years, we’d prefer news from AI over social media influencers, watch AI-generated characters in place of human actors, find romantic partners through AI matchmakers more than through dating apps (or perhaps use AI romantic partners itself), and flip “don’t trust AI” so completely that we’d rely on AI for life-or-death decisions and trust it to raise our children, most people would find that hard to believe. Even with all the intelligence, both natural and artificial, no one can predict with certainty what our AI future will look like. Not the tech CEOs, not the AI researchers, and certainly not some random guy pontificating on the internet. But whether we get the details right or not, our AI future is loading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately 2,879 websites were established before 1995, expanding to 23,500 by June 1995. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_founded_before_1995&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historical data from the Industrial Revolution shows that even as aggregate textile employment grew, workers shifted between job types within the industry as some roles became redundant. And correspondingly, some jobs saw wages collapse while others saw increases. For example, domestic hand-loom weavers were displaced by power looms and saw their wages collapse, while self-acting mule spinners (a newly created role) and factory workers saw stable employment and steady compensation growth. Additionally, Britain’s deflationary period (1815-1850) saw food prices fall by half, meaning real purchasing power often rose even when nominal wages declined. Despite all this, the psychological reality was harsh. Even with falling prices, watching your paycheck shrink while neighbors lost jobs and debts grew harder to pay (lower wages but fixed obligations) created real instability regardless of aggregate statistics improvements. Also see Acemoglu &amp;amp; Johnson, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask any tech product leader about their roadmap planning, and they’ll all universally report far more worthwhile projects than resources to build them, forcing ruthless prioritization to decide what gets built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hyperscalers are large cloud computing companies like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon that operate massive data centers and provide the computing infrastructure necessary to train and run AI models at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Damodaran valued Uber at $6B, assuming a 10% market share of the then $100B taxi market. Uber’s market cap as of October 2025 is $190B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Job transformation doesn’t guarantee comparable compensation. Much of this new “journalism” or content creation happens for free or at rates far below what traditional news organizations paid, separating the work from stable employment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Friendly Tour of Process Memory on Linux&lt;/head&gt;- 24 mins&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Friendly Tour of Process Memory on Linux&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You run a program. It reads and writes addresses as if a giant, continuous slab of memory had been waiting there all along. It didn’t. Linux builds that illusion on the fly, one page at a time. This is a walk through what your process actually owns, what happens on the first touch of a byte, how protections and huge pages fit in, how to see the truth from &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;, and why modern kernels do a little extra dance to defend against Meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: This tour targets Linux on x86‑64, other architectures differ in details (page sizes, cache rules), but the ideas carry over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Intro&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture below is a quick introduction. It is a simple map you can keep in mind as you read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical RAM is the real memory. It is a bunch of frames scattered around. The virtual view is the clean line your program sees. It does not match the real layout. The page table is a list. It tells which spot on the virtual line points to which frame in RAM. Disk is extra space the system can use when RAM is full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is how it plays out. When you read or write, the CPU looks in the page table. If there is an entry it goes to that frame. If there is no entry you get a page fault. The system then fills a frame and adds the entry, or it stops you with an error. We will explain faults later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When RAM is tight the system makes room. It moves pages you have not used in a while to disk, or drops file pages it can load again. If you touch one of those later it brings it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainers appear throughout so anyone can follow along, regardless of background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;is a virtual filesystem the kernel builds in memory. It exposes process and kernel state as files. You can read them with normal tools like&lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The floor plan you never see&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the kernel, your process owns one object that represents its whole address space. Think of it as a floor plan. Each room on that plan is a virtual memory area (VMA) a contiguous range with the same permissions (read, write, execute) and the same kind of backing (anonymous memory or a file).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: VMA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A VMA is a continuous virtual address range with one set of rights and one kind of backing.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the plan sit the page tables that the hardware reads to translate your virtual addresses to real page frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page tables and PTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Page tables are lookup structures the CPU walks to translate addresses. A page table entry (PTE) maps one virtual page to one physical page and holds bits like present and writable.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All threads in the process share the same plan. When the scheduler runs you, the CPU is pointed at your page tables, so pointer dereferences don’t need a syscall once a mapping exists, the hardware does the translation on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You change the plan in three ways: &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; draws a room, &lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt; changes the sign on its door (R/W/X), and &lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt; tears it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;reserves a virtual range with given permissions and a backing source.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt;changes the permissions on an existing range.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;removes a mapping from the address space.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything else (creating pages, reading file data, swapping) happens lazily when you touch memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Hardware manages memory in fixed chunks called pages. On many x86‑64 machines a base page is 4 KiB. Bigger pages exist at 2 MiB and 1 GiB.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A quick glance at your own house&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run:&lt;code&gt;cat /proc/self/maps | sed -n '1,80p'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll see your main binary’s segments (code, data, bss), the heap, anonymous mappings (allocators use these for big chunks), shared libraries, and thread stacks near the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll typically also see two small regions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[vdso]&lt;/code&gt;: a tiny shared object the kernel maps in so a few calls like&lt;code&gt;gettimeofday&lt;/code&gt;can run without a kernel trap.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[vvar]&lt;/code&gt;: read‑only data those helpers use.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vdso&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;vvar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;vdso&lt;/code&gt;is code the kernel maps into your process to make some syscalls fast.&lt;code&gt;vvar&lt;/code&gt;holds data that code reads.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re why asking the time is fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, without the fog&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you call &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, you’re not “allocating memory” so much as drawing a promise on the floor plan. You say give me a range of addresses with these rights and back it by this file plus offset or by anonymous memory. Linux picks an address, makes sure it doesn’t collide, adjusts VMAs so each remains uniform, and records the promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: ASLR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Address Space Layout Randomization places mappings at randomized locations to make exploits harder.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: anonymous vs file mapping&lt;lb/&gt;Anonymous memory is not tied to a file and starts as zeros. File mappings mirror file contents.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does not allocate pages yet. That comes later at first touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two gotchas come up over and over:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;File mappings: &lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;must be page aligned or&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;returns&lt;code&gt;EINVAL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Mapping past end of file is allowed, but touching beyond the true end raises &lt;code&gt;SIGBUS&lt;/code&gt;. The VMA exists, the data does not.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;MAP_SHARED&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_SHARED&lt;/code&gt;means writes go back to the file and are visible to others that share it.&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt;means you see the file but writes go to private copy‑on‑write pages.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anonymous mappings start life as zeroes. File mappings mirror the file. If the file ends mid page the tail of that last page reads as zeros but still belongs to the file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED&lt;/code&gt; means exactly here and it overwrites anything already mapped at that address. Prefer &lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE&lt;/code&gt; to fail instead of clobbering. Without either flag your &lt;code&gt;addr&lt;/code&gt; is just a hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Ask for an exact address and fail if something is already there. Safer than overwriting.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The first touch&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine &lt;code&gt;*p = 42;&lt;/code&gt; to a fresh mapping. The CPU tries to translate the address. It finds no entry so it raises a page fault that includes the address and an error code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page fault&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A page fault is the CPU asking the kernel to handle a missing or illegal translation for an address.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kernel’s handler runs on your behalf and asks three questions in this order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Is the address inside any VMA&lt;lb/&gt;If not you are poking a hole in the plan →&lt;code&gt;SIGSEGV&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do the rights allow this access&lt;lb/&gt;Write to a read only page or execute from non exec →&lt;code&gt;SIGSEGV&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If it is valid but missing make it real&lt;lb/&gt;For an anonymous mapping the kernel allocates a zero filled physical page, wires a page table entry with your requested permissions, and returns to your instruction. For a file mapping it first checks the page cache. If the data is not in RAM it reads from storage, then installs the translation and retries your instruction. Your store lands. You keep going.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page cache&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The page cache is the kernel’s cache of file data in RAM. File mappings read and write through it.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: zero page&lt;lb/&gt;Some reads from fresh anonymous memory can be satisfied by a shared read only page of zeros. A private page is created on the first write.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People count these faults:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;A minor fault means the data was already in RAM and only the translation was missing.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A major fault means the kernel had to wait for I/O which is expensive.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: stack guard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;User stacks have a guard page. Touching just below the current stack can grow it. Touching far below looks like a bug and gets a&lt;code&gt;SIGSEGV&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This same lazy first touch explains how memory is shared after &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; and how &lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt; works. The next section shows that path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Copy on write with &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why this is here. We just talked about first touch. The same rule explains why pages do not copy on &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; and why &lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt; does not change the file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; does not duplicate pages. The child points at the same physical pages as the parent. The kernel flips those pages to read only for both. The first write hits a copy on write fault. The kernel allocates a new page, copies the bytes, updates the writer’s page table entry to the new page with write permission, and returns. Reads still share the original page. That is why RSS stays flat after &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; until you write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: RSS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Resident Set Size is how many pages of this process are currently in RAM. Tiny explainer: copy on write&lt;lb/&gt;Share the same page for reads. Make a private copy only when a write happens.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt; uses the same idea. You read file data through the page cache. When you write, the kernel gives you a private page. The file stays unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things you will also run into:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt;then&lt;code&gt;execve&lt;/code&gt;. The child replaces its whole address space soon after. That avoids most CoW work.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;vfork&lt;/code&gt;. The child runs in the parent’s address space until it calls&lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;_exit&lt;/code&gt;. The parent waits. Do not touch memory in the child.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;CLONE_VM&lt;/code&gt;. This makes a thread. One address space. No copy.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_SHARED&lt;/code&gt;. Writes go to the shared page and to the file or shmem. No CoW.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MADV_DONTFORK&lt;/code&gt;. Leave this mapping out of the child.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MADV_WIPEONFORK&lt;/code&gt;. The child sees zeros for this mapping.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Transparent huge pages. Breaking CoW on a huge page may split it first. Small extra cost.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Changing rights, and the little pause you feel&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why you care. JITs and loaders flip a region from writable to executable after codegen which is W^X. That flip is not free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: W^X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Write xor Execute is a policy. A page is never writable and executable at the same time.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mprotect(addr, len, prot)&lt;/code&gt; changes permissions. Internally the kernel may split VMAs so each remains uniform, edits the page table entries for the range, and then does one more necessary thing. It invalidates old translations from the CPU’s small cache of address translations which is the TLB. That invalidation is the small pause you sometimes feel when a JIT flips RW to RX or back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: TLB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The Translation Lookaside Buffer caches recent translations so the CPU does not walk page tables every time.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most systems enforce W^X. A page should not be writable and executable at the same time. JITs keep to that by flipping after codegen or by keeping two virtual mappings of the same memory so no single mapping is both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember there are two layers of permission checks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Filesystem or mount policy like &lt;code&gt;noexec&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Page permissions like &lt;code&gt;PROT_EXEC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either layer can block execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Seeing what’s really mapped&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For everyday questions the friendly view is enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/maps&lt;/code&gt;shapes: addresses, rights, file names&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/smaps&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;smaps_rollup&lt;/code&gt;add per region accounting like how much is resident which is RSS, private vs shared, and whether huge pages were used like&lt;code&gt;AnonHugePages&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;FilePmdMapped&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you need truth at the per page level Linux exposes sharper tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/pagemap&lt;/code&gt; has one 64 bit entry per virtual page. It tells you whether a page is present, swapped, soft dirty, exclusively mapped with caveats for huge pages, whether it is write protected via userfaultfd, or part of a guard region. It can also reveal the page frame number which is PFN but modern kernels hide PFNs from unprivileged users. You need the right capability or root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: PFN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Page Frame Number is the physical page index used inside the kernel. Tiny explainer: userfaultfd&lt;lb/&gt;A file descriptor that lets a userspace thread handle faults and write protect events for a range.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/kpagecount&lt;/code&gt; is indexed by PFN and tells you how many mappings point at a given physical page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/kpageflags&lt;/code&gt; is also indexed by PFN and tells you what kind of page it is and what is happening to it like anonymous or file backed, part of a transparent huge page, in the LRU, dirty, under writeback, a page table page, or the shared zero page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Common wrinkles&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sparse files. To tell hole vs data, combine &lt;code&gt;mincore()&lt;/code&gt;which says resident or not with&lt;code&gt;lseek(..., SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE)&lt;/code&gt;on the backing file.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shared memory and swap. Shared and shmem pages may be non present at the PTE level while still logically allocated. Expect swap entries and non present PTEs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Privileges. Modern kernels restrict PFN and some flag visibility to privileged users for security.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mincore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;mincore&lt;/code&gt;tells you which pages of a mapping are in RAM.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;code&gt;SEEK_DATA&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;SEEK_HOLE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;File offsets that let you skip to the next data chunk or the next hole in a sparse file.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: soft dirty vs written&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Soft dirty marks pages dirtied by userland but it can get lost across swaps or VMA merges. Newer kernels offer an ioctl named&lt;code&gt;PAGEMAP_SCAN&lt;/code&gt;that scans a range for pages written since last write protect and can in the same step write protect them again. It pairs with userfaultfd write protect to give fast and race free userspace dirty tracking for snapshotting and live migration.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When your page suddenly gets bigger&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your CPU would rather cover more ground with fewer entries in its TLB. Linux can help by backing hot memory with bigger pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: THP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Transparent Huge Pages automatically try to use larger pages for performance when safe.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparent Huge Pages do this automatically for anonymous memory and shmem or tmpfs. A fault can be satisfied with a 2 MiB page instead of 512 small ones. A background thread named khugepaged can also collapse adjacent base pages into a huge page when it is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;khugepaged&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A kernel thread that scans and merges adjacent small pages into huge pages when conditions are right.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern kernels add multi size THP which is mTHP on some architectures. Groups of base pages like 16 KiB or 64 KiB reduce fault count and TLB pressure without always jumping to 2 MiB. They are still PTE mapped but behave as larger folios inside the VM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: mTHP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Multi size THP allows variable order large folios so you get some of the benefit without a full 2 MiB page.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can ask for THP in a region with &lt;code&gt;madvise(..., MADV_HUGEPAGE)&lt;/code&gt; or opt out with &lt;code&gt;MADV_NOHUGEPAGE&lt;/code&gt;. System wide behavior lives under &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/&lt;/code&gt; with per size controls. &lt;code&gt;enabled&lt;/code&gt; can be &lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;madvise&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;inherit&lt;/code&gt;. Shmem or tmpfs have their own knobs like a &lt;code&gt;huge=&lt;/code&gt; mount option with &lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;advise&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;within_size&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to tell if it worked. In &lt;code&gt;/proc/self/smaps&lt;/code&gt; the lines for a region include &lt;code&gt;AnonHugePages&lt;/code&gt; for anonymous THP and &lt;code&gt;FilePmdMapped&lt;/code&gt; for file or shmem huge mappings. System wide &lt;code&gt;/proc/meminfo&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code&gt;AnonHugePages&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ShmemPmdMapped&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ShmemHugePages&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;/proc/vmstat&lt;/code&gt; keeps a diary of THP events allocated on fault, fell back, split, swapped as a whole, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controls plain map:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Top level: &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled&lt;/code&gt;which is&lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;madvise&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Defrag effort: &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag&lt;/code&gt;tunes how hard the kernel tries on the fault path vs deferring to khugepaged&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shmem or tmpfs: &lt;code&gt;huge=always|within_size|advise|never&lt;/code&gt;plus shmem specific knobs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern kernels may also create variable order large folios that are bigger than 4 KiB but PTE mapped not full 2 MiB PMD. This reduces fault count and TLB pressure without always jumping to 2 MiB. Behavior differs by kernel and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One trade off. Assembling a huge page may require compaction which moves other pages to free a contiguous chunk and this can add a small pause. If first touch latency matters more than steady state speed the defrag knob lets you temper how hard the kernel tries which pushes work to khugepaged instead of doing it inline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: THP vs hugetlbfs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;THP is automatic and pageable. Explicit huge pages from&lt;code&gt;MAP_HUGETLB&lt;/code&gt;or hugetlbfs are quota managed and non swap.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dirty‑tracking in userspace, without racing the kernel&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to copy only the pages an application modified since your last snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Give yourself the ability to catch write protect faults with userfaultfd in write protect mode.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;PAGEMAP_SCAN&lt;/code&gt;over your range with the category written since last write protect. Ask the kernel to write protect matching pages and to return compact ranges of what it found.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Copy those ranges. When the app later writes to one of them userfaultfd wakes your thread. Log the dirtied page, clear write protect, and let it proceed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This avoids walking every PTE and avoids the classic race where a page is dirtied while you were looking. It is also fast because scan plus write protect happens as one atomic operation inside the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PAGEMAP_SCAN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;An ioctl that scans a virtual range for pages with properties like written since last protect and can also apply write protect in the same step.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The TLB, and why &lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt; costs a little&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Translation Lookaside Buffer remembers recent translations so the CPU does not walk page tables on every access. If Linux changes a mapping or its permissions it must make sure stale entries are not used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On x86 there are two broad ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Precise invalidation. Invalidate one page at a time with &lt;code&gt;INVLPG&lt;/code&gt;. Good for small changes. A single invalidation on a huge page mapping drops the whole 2 MiB entry.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Broader flushes. Drop many or all entries for example by reloading the page table root register. Fewer instructions now and more misses later while refilling.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is better depends on how big a change you made, whether you are changing small or huge pages, and the microarchitecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: PCID&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Process Context Identifiers tag TLB entries so switching page tables does not flush everything.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: INVPCID&lt;lb/&gt;Allows targeted invalidation of TLB entries for a given tag without switching to it.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a debug knob on some x86 builds named &lt;code&gt;tlb_single_page_flush_ceiling&lt;/code&gt; that nudges when the kernel switches from per page invalidations to a broad flush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;INVLPG&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A privileged instruction that invalidates TLB entries for the page containing a given address in the current address space tag.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Meltdown, and why the kernel sometimes switches maps on entry&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 2018 brought Meltdown. Speculative execution plus a cache side channel could leak data across the user and kernel boundary. Even if a user mode load from a kernel address would fault, the CPU might speculatively execute it and touch data that leaves a measurable cache trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux’s defense on x86‑64 is Page Table Isolation which is PTI. Keep two views and switch between them on entry and exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: CR3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;CR3 holds the current page table root and on x86 switching it changes the active address space.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: PTI&lt;lb/&gt;PTI keeps a reduced userspace view without normal kernel data mapped and a full kernel view used while in the kernel.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost. More page table switches, different TLB sharing behavior, and a small memory bump for extra top level tables and the per CPU entry area. With PCID Linux keeps separate TLB tags for the two views to reduce flushes. Some systems allow opting out with &lt;code&gt;nopti&lt;/code&gt; when acceptable. Default is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: what Meltdown reads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Permissions never turn off. The architectural access still faults. The leak is in transient speculation which leaves a timing trace.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the kernel changes mappings safely&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Linux edits page tables the order is deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Handle cache rules first on architectures that need it.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modify page tables by adding, removing, or changing PTEs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Invalidate the TLB so the CPU forgets stale translations.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood are functions that match the granularity of the change like flush an address space, flush a range, or flush a single page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a parallel story for kernel only mappings made with &lt;code&gt;vmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vmalloc&lt;/code&gt;. Before I/O the kernel flushes the vmap range so the physical page sees the latest bytes. After I/O it invalidates the vmap range so speculative reads do not go stale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vmap&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;vmalloc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;APIs that create kernel virtual mappings to non contiguous physical pages for use inside the kernel.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On x86 you rarely think about the instruction cache because it is coherent with data stores. On others, copying code into executable memory requires an explicit instruction cache flush before running it. The VM has hooks like &lt;code&gt;copy_to_user_page&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flush_icache_range&lt;/code&gt; where architectures do this housekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: icache flush&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Some CPUs need an instruction cache sync after writing new code so execution sees the new bytes.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A tiny x86 aside: stacks and calls, without the haze&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 64 bit mode registers wear an R. &lt;code&gt;RIP&lt;/code&gt; is the instruction pointer, &lt;code&gt;RSP&lt;/code&gt; is the stack, &lt;code&gt;RBP&lt;/code&gt; is the frame. The stack grows down. &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; decrements &lt;code&gt;RSP&lt;/code&gt; and stores. &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; loads then increments. &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; pushes the return address and jumps. &lt;code&gt;RET&lt;/code&gt; pops it into &lt;code&gt;RIP&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Linux the System V AMD64 ABI passes the first arguments in registers which are &lt;code&gt;RDI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RSI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RDX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RCX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;R8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;R9&lt;/code&gt; and returns values in &lt;code&gt;RAX&lt;/code&gt;. Large objects go by pointer. Your stack must be readable and writable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: System V AMD64 ABI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The calling convention for 64 bit Unix like systems on x86‑64 that defines where arguments and return values go.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;User code runs in ring 3. The kernel runs in ring 0. Crossings like syscalls, interrupts, and exceptions go through CPU defined gates. In 64 bit mode Linux uses a flat segmentation model and relies on paging for isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: rings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Rings are CPU privilege levels. Ring 3 is user mode. Ring 0 is kernel mode.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny note for ARM64 readers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The ideas like stack growth and user vs kernel separation are similar. Register names, calling conventions, and syscall entry differ.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When things go sideways (and what that usually means)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;EINVAL&lt;/code&gt;often a misaligned file&lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;which must be page aligned or an impossible flag combo&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;ENOMEM&lt;/code&gt;you may be out of virtual space or VMA count or you hit strict overcommit&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Store to a file mapping → &lt;code&gt;SIGBUS&lt;/code&gt;you walked past EOF.

Prefer&lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE&lt;/code&gt;to fail instead of overwrite&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it is mysterious, look. Start friendly with &lt;code&gt;smaps_rollup&lt;/code&gt; for the big picture and &lt;code&gt;maps&lt;/code&gt; for shapes. Drop to &lt;code&gt;pagemap&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;kpage*&lt;/code&gt; files only when you truly need per page truth and expect to need privileges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A small checklist to keep nearby&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Need memory now. &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;anonymous with&lt;code&gt;PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Generating code.

Touching beyond real EOF is&lt;code&gt;SIGBUS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lots of major faults. Nudge the kernel with &lt;code&gt;MADV_WILLNEED&lt;/code&gt;or touch earlier. Watch page cache and storage&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Where did memory go. Start with &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/smaps_rollup&lt;/code&gt;then&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/maps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Forking big processes. Expect CoW. RSS grows as you write. Consider &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt;in the child for heavy work&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Latency sensitive. Consider THP or mTHP where it helps. &lt;code&gt;mlock&lt;/code&gt;hot sets. Watch your TLB behavior&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback is extremely welcomed!

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You can't cURL a Border&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An error fare to Iceland pops up. It's cheap enough to feel like a typo and most likely will be gone in minutes. I'm moderately obsessed with ways to travel on budget, so I keep an eye on these.&lt;lb/&gt; Before I click Buy, I need to know (fast!) if it actually works for me: would I need a visa, are there any odd passport requirements, can I quickly sort out the driving permit, would it affect my Schengen 90/180 window, break UK presence tests or accidentally prevent a tax residency I am chasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It isn’t one check, it’s a stack of small unfriendly ones, and takes around 20 minutes to process. Some bits are fun, like hunting for a seat upgrade, but mostly it’s counting midnights and expiry dates so a cheap weekend doesn’t become an expensive lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been doing this dance for a decade now. In 2015 I made a spreadsheet for a US visa application that wanted ten years of travel history, down to the day. The spreadsheet grew: UK work visa, Indefinite Leave to Remain and citizenship applications, Canadian work permits. Any government form that asked "where have you been?" got its answer from the same battered CSV. It worked well enough, in the sense that I was never detained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also made me think that this was a solvable problem I was solving badly. I built a ledger to answer “where was I on 15 March 2023?” Instead, I ran simulations to check, “if I book this, what breaks later?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only question is whether the computer can answer all of faster than I do, and leave December, the next border control, and the end of the tax year blissfully uneventful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Does this trip compile? ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That twenty-minute panic before buying a flight comes from one basic problem: none of the systems that judge you will tell you your state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schengen is running one check. The UK is running another. Tax residency is running a third. Your passport is running its own quiet clock in the background. None of them explain themselves, and none of them agree on what “a day” even is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schengen cares about presence across rolling windows. The UK counts how many midnights you were physically in the country in a tax year that, for historical reasons [1], starts on 6 April out of all options. Some countries track how many days you’ve spent in certain places and change the medical paperwork they expect from you once you cross a threshold. Meanwhile your passport might fail you with its expiry date, validity rules that may apply on arrival or departure depending on routing, and a finite number of blank facing pages that some countries require.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of that is easily exposed. The officer at the desk can see it but you can’t. That's parsing the State—both kinds. The government's view of you, and the state machine that tracks it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The bureaucratic edge cases ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rules aren't just complex—they're occasionally specific in ways that make you regret leaving the house in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To apply for British citizenship, you need to prove you were physically in the UK on your application date but five years ago. Not approximately five years, not that week—that exact day when you press "submit" on the form minus five years. Miss it by 24 hours and your application is reject after months of waiting, and you have to pay a hefty fee to re-apply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transiting through a UK airport? Leaving the terminal doesn't count as presence unless you do something "unrelated to your travel"—buy a sausage roll at Greggs, see a play in West End, meet a friend. The guidance doesn't even specify a minimum spend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Morocco runs on UTC+1 most of the year but switches to UTC during Ramadan to shorten the fasting day. Which means "days spent in Morocco" depends on your timezone database version and whether you remembered to update it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be alright with a single source of truth, but all these facts are scattered across (semi)official websites and PDFs, and you're supposed to figure it out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the job isn't "log trips" (I already did that for ten years in a spreadsheet). The job is: given what I've already done and what I'm about to do, does this plan quietly break anything, and if so, where, and by how much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"You're at 56 days because Amsterdam contributed 12, Prague 3, Barcelona 10, Iceland would add a month, and February doesn't count anymore" is something I can trust, argue with, or fix. "You're fine" isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's where this stops being a spreadsheet and starts being a linter. Apparently I want the compiler warning before I press Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Counting the right midnight ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I want a compiler warning I trust, the compiler has to agree with the officer about what a day is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past five years I've been working on an app for people with epilepsy, managing timezones, medication reminders, and edge cases. We juggled multiple sources of truth and multiple storage styles (some records in UTC, some in local time with timezones stored separately—historical reasons, obviously).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, I tried to learn from that: facts are stored as instants, reasoning happens in local days of the jurisdiction that cares.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take this routing: depart Dublin morning of November the 17th, brief Newark layover, a longer one in Mexico City, 23-hour Heathrow stop, then Tenerife. Ask five immigration systems "how many tax residency days?" and you get five answers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ireland: zero (under 30 days/year threshold).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;US: zero (foreign-to-foreign transit under 24 hours).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mexico: two (you cross midnight twice).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UK: zero (even though you cross midnight once), unless you went landside for non-travel reasons, then one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Schengen: one (entry day counts, exit day will count too, even if both are only for 15 minutes).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each stop has same or similar conditions, but different state machines are asking different questions. I pin the timezone database version that produced each result, and when rules or clocks shift, I recompute so I could show both answers if needed. Yesterday should stay reproducible even when tomorrow disagrees.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parsing the State ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, the linter is meant to answer the same question in various disguises: "what happens if I do this?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can I book Christmas in the Alps with three summer weekends planned in Europe? Does it matter if I leave UK before the tax year ends? What passport should I travel on? Does anything expire between booking and boarding?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every question has the same shape: simulate forward, find what breaks, decide if you care. The goal isn't to convince border officers—it's to not make mistakes they'd catch. Trips get assembled from whatever I can verify later: geotagged photos, background location, manual entries. A resolver turns that into "present on this local day" and keeps track of why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't hardcode rules, I ship interpretations instead: each jurisdiction has a small versioned blob that says what counts, how the window is measured, where that reading came from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paperwork gets the same treatment because documents are state machines too. A passport isn’t just means of identity; it has constraints and timers. Some requirements, like six months validity are legacy and usually exist to keep deportations possible without issuing emergency documents, but still need to be checked. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I buy anything the linter should tell me that I don't have the correct flavour of IDP (and man, getting those in Scotland since they delegated it from Post Offices to corner shops is tough), that a Dubai connection flips a “valid on arrival” buffer into “invalid on departure”. Quiet warnings, early enough to change dates or renew the right booklet, and clear enough that I won't have to improvise at a counter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the world changes—new examples, revised guidance, a delayed system finally launches—I don’t rewrite history. I version the assumption, keep both answers recorded, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keeping all those rules up-to-date is hard, so rather than maintaining rules for every country, I parse a few databases, then let users configure their own tracking goals. A user emailed about Cyprus's fast-tracked tax residency scheme; another pointed out I'd missed a few countries entirely. The app gets better as people use it, which feels more honest than pretending to be a global authority on 195 countries' immigration rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making things public ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is local by default. Calculations happen on-device, and if you're in airplane mode, it still works. Network is always the bottleneck, and I'm the person who spent a weekend reverse-engineering gym entry to save 44 seconds. I'm not adding server round-trips when you're standing at a gate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being local also means no liability. Personal immigration history is exactly the kind of data governments might want. Keeping it off my servers means nobody can demand I hand it over. Some friends asked about cloud sync: I keep saying no. Not because sync is hard—it is, though surely Claude Code can do that for me [4]—but because the moment you add a server you add retention policies, jurisdiction questions, and a magnet for legal demands. If you want it on another device, export a file and move it yourself like the ancestors did it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first version just counted Schengen days, then I added the UK's midnight arithmetic because I needed it for my own calculations. Then documents with their expiry rules because I was tired of manually looking them up. Then the what-if layer because adding and deleting trips to see impact felt like manually diffing state. Then visa requirements and IDP rules: none of this was planned, it accumulated from use, the same way my fermentation tracker grew from "can I eat this?" to HACCP compliance documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I shipped it because keeping it private felt unfinished, and because I'd like fewer people spending twenty minutes researching whether a £62 return flight will cause problems six months later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Iceland error fare? I bought it. The app told me I wouldn't need an IDP, that the trip wouldn't push me over any Schengen threshold, that I'd leave with 34 days of margin in my 90/180 window, and—importantly—that booking it would mean I'd stop being a UK tax resident given my upcoming Canada move. Useful things to know before clicking purchase. The officer at Keflavík looked at his screen, agreed with his systems, and waved me through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I called the app Residency and you can get it here. No subscriptions, costs less than an airport martini, and you'll likely regret it less a few hours later.[5]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can't &lt;code&gt;cURL&lt;/code&gt; a border. But you can track your own state carefully enough that when the governments know the answer, so do you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on problems where rules are complex and official documentation is &lt;del&gt;garbage&lt;/del&gt; contradictory? I build systems that handle state when the state won't tell you your state. work@drobinin.com&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Until 1752, England’s New Year began on 25 March, aka Lady Day. The calendar reform shaved 11 days off, nudging the tax year to 5 April, and skipping a leap day in 1800 pushed it to 6 April. Two centuries later it stays there probably because changing it would be expensive and annoying. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Apparently time zones shift all the time for a variety of reasons, from political to religious. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I couldn't find any legit reasons for keeping the "six-month rule" around but it seems like it's still occasionally checked, sometimes even during boarding. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These stunts are performed by trained professionals, don't try this at home. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I have nothing against airport bars, but hear me out: vermouth should be kept in the fridge at all times, and glasses need to be chilled. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Photograph courtesy of Bud Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After eight glorious weeks of freedom, I got rehired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First thing I did was walk over to the machine shop to look for my F-150. The oil stain was there but the truck wasn’t. It wasn’t in the rock lot where the bulldozers parked either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who would have stooped so low as to co-opt that piece of shit? It had no heat and no air-conditioning. The radio bubbled static. Door handles were missing. Floorboards, fenders, and frame all rusted and rotted. It certainly hadn’t been what could be called roadworthy. And, my God, the smell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went into the machine shop. One of the welders lifted his hood and told me the bad news—they’d had to move the truck for a rebar delivery and the engine on that old thing finally blew, so the truck got dragged to the scrapyard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a dusty corner, I saw a pile of salvaged tools from the truck. I took some wrenches and my tape measure but didn’t see what I was really looking for—my Truck Desk®. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I caught a ride out to the unit with the foreman and the rest of the crew. Our goal for the day was to unbolt components from a heat exchanger and fly them off with a crane. Once the exchanger was apart and inspected, we’d begin our real repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The morning went well. The mornings always go well. Everybody knows what they’re doing. We’re professionals, equals. Same pay. Same benefits. All working together toward retirement. We look out for each other. Whoever has the hardest task in this crew today could be the foreman tomorrow, and vice versa. Nobody wants to be the boss, so our bosses are the best kind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first break we packed into our truck and drove shoulder-to-shoulder back to the trailer compound for coffee. During the five-minute drive, I couldn’t help but think how good I’d had it when I had the luxury of using that piece of shit F-150.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See, the truck nobody else wanted had been my office. I’d built a portable desk inside it. My truck desk, I called it. A couple of planks screwed together, our union sticker slapped on, the whole deal sealed with shellac. I’d built the desk so it slid into the bottom of the steering wheel and sat across the armrests. I used to hang back at the job and sneak in some creative work while the rest of the crew went to break. My desk—which I’d taken far too long to build and perfect through many prototypes—had been stowed behind the driver’s seat when the truck was hauled off by the wrecker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back at the break trailer, I took my old seat and joined in on the jokes, insults, tall tales. That trailer was, to me, the best place for storytelling in the world—but, as always, it was too loud, too raucous, too fun to do any writing or reading, which is all I ever want to do on break. At lunch, I retreated into the relative quiet of the machine shop. I sat down by the drill press and took out my cell phone and started writing. Just like I used to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For nearly two decades I’ve worked off and on at this petrochemical plant as a mechanic and welder. The union dispatched me here: When it gets slow, I get laid off; when work picks up, I boomerang back. And the whole time, I’ve written stories and parts of my novels during breaks—fifteen minutes for coffee and then half an hour for lunch. I’ve also made use of the heaven-sent delays brought on by lightning, severe rainstorms, evacuations, permitting problems, equipment issues, and so on. I’m thankful for each and every delay that happens on this construction site, and, believe me, there are many.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most artists I know are like this. Finding time to make art while working another job, or taking care of loved ones. They improvise. They get better. They get worse. They get better again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really it mostly comes down to that first thing: finding time. When I talk to people who want to find more time, I repeat something an old-timer said to me early on: “You’ve gotta make your own conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does that mean? Well. Is it raining? You can either stand out in the rain and get wet, or you can find a coil of tie-wire and hang up tarps for a hooch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s another expression I like, which goes: “Let your wallet be your guide.” I try to remember that every time I feel the urge to quit my job and never return.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So ever since cell phones got smart, I’ve sat somewhere quiet, semi-on-the-clock, texting myself poems, paragraphs that became stories and novels, and things about my life, or I should say just life, like this thing you’re reading right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing on my cell phone, pecking away, was good enough for many years, but then after a rightfully humbling decade of manual labor, I started having irrational fantasies about convenience and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course I have a desk in my apartment, but I couldn’t help myself. Somehow I’d gotten seduced by the prospect of attaining my very own cubicle amid this massive junkyard full of toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day I walked into the payroll trailer where the secretaries and site manager sat. There wasn’t an explicit sign that said NO CONTRACTORS ALLOWED, but it was an unspoken rule. The trailer had a few unused old cubicles tucked to the side. I sat down in one and happily pecked away with my thumbs. Every break for a week I went in and worked on my writing. After a few days I started to feel like I should hang pictures of my mom and dad and my wife inside it. But I didn’t dare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then things really heated up. I brought in a Bluetooth keyboard and wrote a whole story that day on my breaks. There was no going back. My heart soared. I thought I should adopt a brown dog with a bandanna around his neck just so I could thumbtack his picture to the cubicle wall. I hadn’t interacted with any of the office staff, but they’d seen me. They’d followed my oily bootprints down the hallway and begun to leer. Who is this diesel-stinking contractor? He’s probably the one who’s been eating Janelle’s Oreos. He raided the mango-kiwi yogurt from the fridge. He glommed all the sporks. I knew my cubicle dreams were over the morning I found the site manager waiting in “my” cubicle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What are you doing here?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all my years working at that place, I’d never seen the site manager out on the site. I’m not sure he knew what it was or where it was. You went to him to order tools; he was the one who said no. I’d only ever seen him at a urinal or buying bacon and eggs off the lunch truck. But if I had ever seen him out on the site, it would have never occurred to me to ask him what he was doing there. He was wearing a blue polo shirt and khakis, and I was in his world—and he was asking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Office work,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What kind, exactly?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can you explain literary fiction to a site manager?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Little bit of everything,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started writing in the machine shop again. It wasn’t the same. Once I’d been infected by the cubicle virus, there was no going back. Out of scrap lumber I gathered from various dumpsters, I built a proper desk for myself in the northeast corner of the shop. That desk was a huge leap forward in possibility and productivity. In the evenings, if I wrote something by hand or on my typewriter at home, I could now use my time at work to retype it at my shop desk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shop desk was not ideal. Some days I arrived to find someone had disassembled a small motor on top of it, gaskets and hardware spread out on newspaper. Other times I found pneumatic guns taken apart, or electrical devices with wiring splayed in a colorful tangle, or—fair enough—important blueprints laid out the entire length of the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right around this time I first saw the F-150. One of the workers had abandoned it by the shop. I put a battery in. That lasted one shift. Then I took an alternator out of another junk truck and, lo and behold, I had my own four wheels. The fan belt screamed. The engine smoked. The brakes worked when they wanted to. It was mine that whole dangerous year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, one day, my luck changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A crate full of chain falls got delivered. It was a glorious crate, made of sanded spruce. I unscrewed some of the planking and built my first Truck Desk prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was made of three boards cut at twenty-four inches. Light and compact. Sealed with shellac. It slid into the bottom of the steering wheel, one side supported by a curved rebar I welded into a nut that fit exactly in a recess on the driver’s door. The center console supported the other side of the desk. I kept it stored behind the seat. Whenever break time came and the crew drove back to the trailer compound, I stayed parked on the unit and got at least ten extra minutes to write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that I had my Truck Desk, that vehicle was my very own rolling cubicle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having that truck reminded me of when I lived on 173rd Street in New York City. Back then I used to drive around endlessly looking for street parking. I would see men and women sitting in their cars. They weren’t leaving, though; they were reading a book or a magazine, smoking cigarettes, playing Sudoku, scribbling love letters. They were the wisest men and women in the entire city, using their vehicles as a kind of office down on the street, a sanctuary where they could do their real work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the F-150 was scrapped, I never got a replacement truck. I never found that first Truck Desk either, even when I called the scrapyard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I did do, though, was go over to the carpenter’s side of the shop and cut a scaffold plank at twenty-nine inches. This simple plank fits across the armrests of whatever Chevy or Ford pickup the crew has that day. This dramatic redesign of Truck Desk into Truck Plank® took all of ten seconds. I didn’t bother with the sticker or shellac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The years on the job have rolled on. Now editors send me Word documents with comments and questions and tracked changes. I bring my backpack to work with my laptop inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every morning, when I find out what crew I’m in, I bring that plank with me. I stick it on the dashboard and climb into the driver’s seat. I drive us all out to the job and at break time I take them to the trailer. I clean my hands with pumice wipes and sit alone in whoever’s truck it is that day, pulling the plank off the dashboard and setting it across the armrests. Within a minute or so, I’ve got the laptop out and I’m working. If somebody from the crew is still in the back seat, bandanna over their eyes, snoozing, I do my best to keep extra quiet. And if they begin to snore, I don’t let that bother me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Just saw the CEO of Substack celebrating traffic from X/Twitter shooting up thinking they stopped suppressing tweets with links[0]. Actually, this traffic is because now any time you open a tweet with a link, the in-app webview loads in the background, and displays when you press the link.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I run an ecom store that gets a lot of its customers from Twitter. I was also shocked to see my traffic double or triple overnight and thought the algorithm had blessed me and my business. Soon realized what was actually happening. Thought other traffic-monitors might appreciate this explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Nikita Bier is pretending they never suppressed tweets with links to begin with, offering the alternative explanation: "a common complaint is that posts with links tend to get lower reach. This is because the web browser covers the post and people forget to Like or Reply. So X doesn't get a clear signal whether the content is any good"[1]. A bit of a rewriting of history since Elon and his mom both tweeted about how it wasn't fair to use his platform to promote other links/platforms, even banning people who shared profiles of other social networks (including Paul Graham for a period). They suppressed all links shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A great blog post from 2013 describes using bloom filters to build a space-efficient full text search index for small numbers of documents. The algorithm is simple: Per document, create a bloom filter of all its words. To query, simply check each document's bloom filter for the query terms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a query time complexity of O(number-of-documents), we can forget about using this on big corpuses, right? In this blog post I propose a way of scaling the technique to large document corpuses (e.g. the web) and discuss why that is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: There is a nice implementation of this exact algorithm that is still used in the wild. But let's get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why even try this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bloom filter index's big selling point is its small size. It allows static websites with dozens of pages to ship a full text search index to the client that is as small as a small image. An equivalent inverted index, which is the traditional textbook approach for keyword-based full text search, would be multiple times bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But index size is not only relevant on small blog websites. If we could scale this technique to larger document corpuses and achive similar space savings, that would be huge!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main thing that seems to stand in our way is query performance. Instead of always checking every document's bloom filter, we will try to construct an index that only checks a small subset of filters, but still finds all matching documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some Ideas that don't work at all&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, I brainstormed a bunch of ideas for how to improve the bloom filter based index. I will quickly go over two of them, because identifying and discarding ideas that will not work is an important part of science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sort the filters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we sort the filters by some metric, for example by the most to least significant bits, then we can use a binary search algorithm or something like that, right? - Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can construct a simple counter example to show that this does not work. Here the query is matched by the first and the last filter in a sorted list of filters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tree of filters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plain sorting does not work, but what if we structure our big set of filters into a tree? Imagine it sort of like this, but much bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At each branch node, we construct an aggregate filter that encodes all documents that are reachable from the branch. Aggregate filters are constructed by a simple bitwise or of the other filters like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we get a query, we first check it against the top level branch filters. If a filter does not match e.g. the filter for document 6-10, we can discard that entire branch of the tree for this query.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally we would like to search as few branches of the tree as possible to improve performance. How many branches we do need to search, depends heavily on the partitioning of the documents. Intuitively, we can think of it like this: branch A should contain all documents that contain the words "dog", "cat", "bird". Branch B should contain documents with "car", "bus", "plane". The fewer branches each word is contained in the better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here comes the problem: What if there is a document that says "I took my cat on the bus today"?&lt;lb/&gt; This breaks our assumtion above, and suddenly for the query "bus" we need to search both branches. You can imagine this happening for almost every word in the dicionary across all branches, because language is complex and lets us say so many different things in many different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or in other words: Text documents are high-dimensional.&lt;lb/&gt; I recommend reading about the curse of dimensionality for an intuition of what issues this implies. Here it means that it is basically impossible to cluster text documents into disjunct subsets without significant overlap. For our seach index that means that even when using this tree, we would still need to search almost every document for every query.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inverted Index of Bloom Filters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem with our previous tree-based idea is that there is so much overlap between text documents. But I know one book that only contains every work exactly once: The dictionary. We can construct a search tree of the entire dictionary, again based on bloom filters. Each leaf represents a set of words. At each leaf we keep a list of pointers to every document's filter that contains one of those words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe not so incidentally, this looks a lot like an inverted index. And it works! For any query term we can walk the tree to the leaf that contains the query term and then we match only against the filters at that leaf. Instead of a hash table, as in the inverted index, our index uses a tree for the dictionary, but fundamentally it does a similar thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big difference is that the tree can be smaller than the hash table. Remember, size is the main reason to attempt this at all. Not only is there no empty space in a tree, but we also encode all the words in our bloom filters instead of storing them outright. Modern bloom filters (actually called Xor filters) require about ten bits per element [1], much less than the 8 bits per character required to store a full word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an aside, bloom filters are indeed already used in full text search for large-ish datasets, but in the form of skip-indexes. In a skip index, a bloom filter is used to quickly check if a large chunk of data contains a value (e.g. a word) at all. That way, a database can avoid reading chunks of data that do not contain any records for a given query. Until very recently this technique was used by the Clickhouse OLAP system for full text search [2]. It has been superseeded by a proper inverted index in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why all of this is still a bad idea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did it! We have a working idea for a bloom filter based search index that works for large document corpuses. The query time complexity is not as good as for an inverted index, but it is logarithmic with the number of documents. That is good enough if you ask me. So why do I write that it is still a bad idea?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's think about what allows the bloom filter based index to be small again. Instead of storing the entire dictionary in our index, we use bloom filters that require about ten bits per word. Ten bits per word. Ten bits per every word. Not unique word. Every word in our document corpus (except duplicates in the same document). To make our math exceedingly simple, let's say the english dictionary has about 500 Thousand unique words and every document contains 1000 distinct words. At ten bits per entry for a bloom filter, that makes each document's filter about 1.25kb. Assume that words are on average ten characters long, then the dictionary will require 5mb for the text alone. We can assume another 4mb for the inverted index's hash table to get a lower bound of 9mb for the inverted index. Both indexes require similar amounts of space for document ids and pointers, so relative to the inverted index, our bloom filter index grows by 1.25kb per document. Divide 9mb by 1.25kb and you find out that at only 7200 documents the inverted index becomes more space efficient than the bloom filter index. Of course the real numbers will be different and we are ignoring some things here, but the trend will stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is going on here is that while an inverted index must store every word in the dictionary exactly once, sharing the space when a word is reused, bloom filters do not share space amongst each other. Every document's bloom filter must encode all words in the document from scratch. If a word is contained in thousands of documents, that requires much more space than simply storing the word in plain text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you have a small number of documents relative to the size of your dictionary, bloom filters can indeed achieve a much smaller full text search index than is possible traditionally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bloom filters are space efficient when compressing a large dictionary into a small number of filters. As more filters share the same dictionary, this efficiency decreases. Intuitively this is because bloom filters cannot share information amongst each other. Each filter must encode its entire dictionary from scratch. An inverted index does not do this. It only stores the dictionary once and shares it for all documents, so it gets more space efficient with the number of documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More generally, there is no synergy between bloom filters. Each filter on its own is efficient, but as a whole system, a different approach might be more efficient. We can transfer this insight to other problem domains as well. For example, imagine a content moderation system on a social media platform that allows blocking individual accounts. If we have one global blocklist on our platform, a bloom filter can be an efficient (though maybe not ideal) implementation of this. But allow every user to create their own blocklist and a different design will be more scaleable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Is a Manifold?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standing in the middle of a field, we can easily forget that we live on a round planet. We’re so small in comparison to the Earth that from our point of view, it looks flat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world is full of such shapes — ones that look flat to an ant living on them, even though they might have a more complicated global structure. Mathematicians call these shapes manifolds. Introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-19th century, manifolds transformed how mathematicians think about space. It was no longer just a physical setting for other mathematical objects, but rather an abstract, well-defined object worth studying in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new perspective allowed mathematicians to rigorously explore higher-dimensional spaces — leading to the birth of modern topology, a field dedicated to the study of mathematical spaces like manifolds. Manifolds have also come to occupy a central role in fields such as geometry, dynamical systems, data analysis and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, they give mathematicians a common vocabulary for solving all sorts of problems. They’re as fundamental to mathematics as the alphabet is to language. “If I know Cyrillic, do I know Russian?” said Fabrizio Bianchi, a mathematician at the University of Pisa in Italy. “No. But try to learn Russian without learning Cyrillic.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what are manifolds, and what kind of vocabulary do they provide?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ideas Taking Shape&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For millennia, geometry meant the study of objects in Euclidean space, the flat space we see around us. “Until the 1800s, ‘space’ meant ‘physical space,’” said José Ferreirós, a philosopher of science at the University of Seville in Spain — the analogue of a line in one dimension, or a flat plane in two dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Euclidean space, things behave as expected: The shortest distance between any two points is a straight line. A triangle’s angles add up to 180 degrees. The tools of calculus are reliable and well defined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But by the early 19th century, some mathematicians had started exploring other kinds of geometric spaces — ones that aren’t flat but rather curved like a sphere or saddle. In these spaces, parallel lines might eventually intersect. A triangle’s angles might add up to more or less than 180 degrees. And doing calculus can become a lot less straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mathematical community struggled to accept (or even understand) this shift in geometric thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But some mathematicians wanted to push these ideas even further. One of them was Bernhard Riemann, a shy young man who had originally planned to study theology — his father was a pastor — before being drawn to mathematics. In 1849, he decided to pursue his doctorate under the tutelage of Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had been studying the intrinsic properties of curves and surfaces, independent of the space surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1854, Riemann was required to deliver a lecture to secure a teaching position at the University of Göttingen. His assigned topic: the foundations of geometry. On June 10, despite a fear of public speaking, he described a new theory in which he generalized Gauss’ ideas about the geometry of surfaces to an arbitrary number of dimensions (and even to infinite dimensions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gauss was immediately impressed with the lecture, which involved not just math but also philosophy and physics. But most mathematicians found Riemann’s ideas too vague and abstract to be of much use. “Many scientists and philosophers were saying, ‘This is nonsense,’” Ferreirós said. And so, for decades, the work was largely ignored. Riemann’s lecture didn’t appear in print until 1868, two years after his death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But by the end of the 19th century, mathematical greats like Henri Poincaré had recognized the importance of Riemann’s ideas. And in 1915, Albert Einstein used them in his general theory of relativity, bringing them out of the realm of philosophical abstraction and into the real world. By the middle of the 20th century, they had become a mathematical staple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Riemann had introduced a concept that could encompass all possible geometries, in any number of dimensions. A concept that would change how mathematicians view space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A manifold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Charted Territory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term “manifold” comes from Riemann’s Mannigfaltigkeit, which is German for “variety” or “multiplicity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A manifold is a space that looks Euclidean when you zoom in on any one of its points. For instance, a circle is a one-dimensional manifold. Zoom in anywhere on it, and it will look like a straight line. An ant living on the circle will never know that it’s actually round. But zoom in on a figure eight, right at the point where it crosses itself, and it will never look like a straight line. The ant will realize at that intersection point that it’s not in a Euclidean space. A figure eight is therefore not a manifold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, in two dimensions, the surface of the Earth is a manifold; zoom in far enough anywhere on it, and it’ll look like a flat 2D plane. But the surface of a double cone — a shape consisting of two cones connected at their tips — is not a manifold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manifolds address a problem that mathematicians would otherwise have to deal with: A shape’s properties can change depending on the nature and dimension of the space it lives in (and how it sits in that space). For instance, lay a piece of string on a table, and connect its ends without lifting it. You’ll get a simple loop. Now hold the string in the air and tie its ends together. By considering the string in three dimensions, you can pass it over and under itself before you connect the ends, creating all sorts of knots beyond the simple loop. They all represent the same one-dimensional manifold — the looped string — but they have different properties when considered in two versus three dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians avoid such ambiguities by focusing on the manifold’s intrinsic properties. The defining property of manifolds — that at any point, they look Euclidean — is immensely helpful on that front. Because it’s possible to think about any small patch of the manifold in terms of Euclidean space, mathematicians can use traditional calculus techniques to, say, compute its area or volume, or describe movement on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do this, mathematicians divide a given manifold into several overlapping patches and represent each with a “chart” — a set of some number of coordinates (equal to the manifold’s dimension) that tell you where you are on the manifold. Crucially, you also need to write down rules that describe how the coordinates of overlapping charts relate to one another. The collection of all these charts is called an atlas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then use this atlas — whose charts translate smaller regions of your potentially complicated manifold into familiar Euclidean space — to measure and explore the manifold one patch at a time. If you want to understand how a function behaves on a manifold, or get a sense of its global structure, you can break the problem up into pieces, solve each piece on a different chart, in Euclidean space, and then stitch together the results from all the charts in the atlas to get the full answer you’re seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, this approach is ubiquitous throughout math and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Manifold Uses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manifolds are crucial to our understanding of the universe, for one. In his general theory of relativity, Einstein described space-time as a four-dimensional manifold, and gravity as that manifold’s curvature. And the three-dimensional space we see around us is also a manifold — one that, as manifolds do, appears Euclidean to those of us living within it, even though we’re still trying to figure out its global shape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in cases where manifolds don’t seem to be present, mathematicians and physicists try to rewrite their problems in the language of manifolds to make use of their helpful properties. “So much of physics comes down to understanding geometry,” said Jonathan Sorce, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University. “And often in surprising ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider a double pendulum, which consists of one pendulum hanging from the end of another. Small changes in the double pendulum’s initial conditions lead it to carve out very different trajectories through space, making its behavior hard to predict and understand. But if you represent the configuration of the pendulum with just two angles (one describing the position of each of its arms), then the space of all possible configurations looks like a doughnut, or torus — a manifold. Each point on this torus represents one possible state of the pendulum; paths on the torus represent the trajectories the pendulum might follow through space. This allows researchers to translate their physical questions about the pendulum into geometric ones, making them more intuitive and easier to solve. This is also how they study the movements of fluids, robots, quantum particles and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, mathematicians often view the solutions to complicated algebraic equations as a manifold to better understand their properties. And they analyze high-dimensional datasets — such as those recording the activity of thousands of neurons in the brain — by looking at how those data points might sit on a lower-dimensional manifold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Asking how scientists use manifolds is akin to asking how they use numbers, Sorce said. “They are at the foundation of everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google Cloud suspended customer's account three times, for three different reasons&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experience leads company boss to decide 'I cannot rely on having a Google account for production use cases'&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founder of a service that manages SSL certificates says Google Cloud has suspended his account three times, without good reason, and recommended not using the G-Cloud for serious workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Monday post, Andrew Ayer, founder of SSLMate, explains that his company uses Google Cloud for “testing and experimentation,” but mostly “to enable integrations with our customers' Google Cloud accounts so that we can publish certificate validation DNS records and discover domain names to monitor on their behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Google Cloud blunder sinks Australian fund for a week&lt;/head&gt;READ MORE&lt;p&gt;“We create a service account for each customer under our Google Cloud project, and ask the customer to authorize this service account to access Cloud DNS and Cloud Domains,” Ayer wrote. “When SSLMate needs to access a customer's Google Cloud account, it impersonates the corresponding service account.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayer said he developed this system based on a suggestion in Google Cloud’s own documentation on how to use cloud APIs. He says it “works really well” and is “both very easy for the customer to configure, and secure: there are no long-lived credentials or confused deputy vulnerabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time it broke was in May 2024, when Ayer tried to log in and saw a message stating he had used Google Cloud in a way that violated the company’s policies. His post explains the “super frustrating” effort required to restore access, as Google asked him to provide information that was only accessible if he logged in – while the web giant prevented him from logging in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayer managed to partially restore access, but was then told Google had again restricted his account – this time for a different reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google later restored access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was never told why our account was suspended or what could be done to prevent it from happening again,” he wrote, adding that Google never sent emails notifying him of the suspension. He therefore wrote a health check to warn him if SSLMate’s customer integrations failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Google yanks Gemma after US senator says model ‘hallucinated’ her committing crimes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Google parent company spending like a drunken sailor as capex triples over 2 years&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Google says reports of a Gmail breach have been greatly exaggerated&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Google unmasks itself as mystery hyperscaler behind yet another UK datacenter&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, in late October, that health check failed because all customer integrations were down as Google had again flagged them as violating its policies. This time, restoration was swift, helped by the fact Ayer had access to information he knew Google support would require to act on his complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, Google suspended SSLMate’s account again. Ayer says Google offered a new reason for its actions: A terms of service violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He appealed and two days later received “an automated email stating that SSLMate's access to Google Cloud was now completely suspended.” He shared his story on social media, and Google restored his services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gets weirder, because the suspensions didn’t impact all of SSLMate’s customer integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot rely on having a Google account for production use cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incredibly, we have one lucky customer whose integration has continued to work during every suspension, even though it uses a service account in the same suspended project as all the other customer integrations,” Ayer wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He now thinks SSLMate needs to ditch Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, I cannot rely on having a Google account for production use cases,” he wrote. “Google has built a complex, unreliable system in which some or all of the following can be suspended: an entire Google account, a Google Cloud Platform account, or individual Google Cloud projects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His post outlines a potential workaround for his Google problem by using OpenID Connect (OIDC), but feels the web giant has made that fix “unnecessarily difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayer is frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I find this state of affairs unacceptable, because it's really, really important to move away from long-lived credentials and Google ought to be doing everything possible to encourage more secure alternatives,” he wrote. “Sadly, SSLMate's current solution of provider-created service accounts is susceptible to arbitrary account suspensions, and OIDC is hampered by an unnecessarily complicated setup process.” ®&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;On this day in 1988, the Morris worm infected 10% of the Internet within 24 hours — worm slithered out and sparked a new era in cybersecurity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Internet contracted worms a year before the World Wide Web was even a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week in 1988, Cornell graduate student Robert Tappan Morris unleashed his eponymous worm upon the Internet. The wave of infections grew to 10% of the entire Internet within 24 hours, causing astronomically expensive damage for the time. However, the pioneering Morris worm malware wasn’t made with malice, says an FBI retrospective on the “programming error.” It was designed to gauge the size of the Internet, resulting in a classic case of unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Morris worm dissection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Known to be something of a prankster, Morris must have felt some foreboding about releasing his ‘innocent’ program into the wild. Evidence of this comes from his release method. “He released it by hacking into an MIT computer from his Cornell terminal in Ithaca, New York,” according to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Morris worm was written in C and targeted BSD UNIX systems, like VAX and Sun-3 machines. Specifically, the FBI writes, it “exploited a backdoor in the Internet’s electronic mail system and a bug in the ‘finger’ program that identified network users.” In contrast to computer viruses, the worm Morris had devised had no need of a host program, but could self-replicate and spread autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the Morris worm wasn’t written to cause damage to files. Due to those unintended consequences, though, it precipitated massive slowdowns, and messaging delays and system crashes were common symptoms. It became a computer news sensation in the worst possible way. Just to get rid of the worm in a timely fashion, some institutions ended up wiping complete systems and unplugging networks for as long as a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the Morris worm's casualties were prestigious institutions such as Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, NASA, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Whodunit?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts worked hard to find a fix, and while they did so, the question of who was behind the worm came to the fore. Understandably, whoever created and unleashed this worm needed to feel some consequences, and thus, the FBI was brought in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently, Morris sought to anonymously explain and apologize for the worm, but an inadvertent slip of his initials by a friend landed Morris in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FBI interviews and computer file analysis would subsequently confirm Morris was the culprit. He was indicted under the rather freshly inked Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. After a court appearance for his misdemeanors in 1989, Morris ended up not with jail time, but with a fine, probation, and 400 hours of community service to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Computer worms have been around longer than the World Wide Web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in November 1988, the Internet bore little resemblance to what it is today. For example, the World Wide Web (WWW) wasn’t even a thing. Though the WWW would soon form the core experience for the first tide of surfers in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, the Internet’s backbone was the NSFNET, the recent successor to ARPANET. Its purpose was mostly to expand the prior backbone’s reach beyond military and defense institutions, and it more broadly embraced academia. While we are here, it is worth mentioning that NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, and succeeded by the commercial Internet, which emerged in the 1990s off the back of private ISPs and commercial backbones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, when we talk about 10% of the Internet being paralyzed by the Morris Worm, contemporary estimates are that about 6,000 of the approximately 60,000 connected systems were infected and impacted. Moreover, when we highlighted the potentially massive costs of this first worm propagating, estimates range from $100,000 to millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computer worms have remained a scary phenomenon in recent times. For example, we reported on the first-generation AI worm, the Morris II generative AI worm, last year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Server DRAM prices surge up to 50% as AI-induced memory shortage hits hyperscaler supply — U.S. and Chinese customers only getting 70% order fulfillment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. and China buyers now see just 70% order fulfillment, as AI demand drives DDR5 shortages and PC parts follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DRAM supply chain is choking, and server memory is taking the first hit. According to DigiTimes, major U.S. and Chinese hyperscalers are now receiving just 70% of the server DRAM they order. That’s despite agreeing to contract price increases of up to 50% for Q4, well above the 30% hike many buyers had budgeted for earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally, AI sits at the core of all this. While it’s HBM that gets the headlines, demand for conventional DDR5 RDIMMs is also outpacing supply, particularly at advanced nodes where Samsung and SK hynix have diverted capacity toward parts bound for AI acceleration. Samsung’s recent pricing adjustments confirm the reprioritization, with the company having raised server SSD prices by up to 35% and RDIMM contract rates by as much as 50%, citing sustained demand from enterprise and cloud customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s left is a market where even the largest buyers can’t secure enough memory. Spot prices have surged since late September, and several top-tier suppliers are reportedly refusing to quote for October allocations. DDR5 16 GB modules that traded at $7 to $8 last month are now hovering around $13, with availability tightening further into November. Module makers are bracing for out-of-stock situations by the end of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of the market fares worse. Channel players and smaller OEMs are seeing order fulfillment rates closer to 35% to 40%. With hyperscalers locking in fixed allocations, lower-priority customers are pushed to the spot market or told to wait until capacity opens up in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Micron warned of this in its most recent earnings call, telling investors that DRAM is a “tight industry” and that bit supply growth will lag demand through the end of next year. TrendForce also flagged a potential quote freeze across certain modules, as suppliers shift to day-to-day pricing in China and avoid locking themselves into bad deals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is causing retail DDR5 prices to creep upward, with no sign of stabilization before year’s end. DDR4, meanwhile, is in slow decline.
