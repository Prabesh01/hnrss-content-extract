  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used Apple Configurator to turn my iPhone into a dumb phone. I can only access the apps and websites I want to use, and it’s feeling great!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to when I started I’m saving about 2 hours of screen time a day. If I kept this up for a month I promised to write a post about this setup. It’s now two months so here’s my post. What follows is a backstory, observations, and a how-to-guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get straight to the how-to-guide, click here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s common to rack up 4 hours or more of screen time a day on your phone. Here’s one way to see the cost of that: every 20 years, you lose 5 years of your waking time looking at your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what had me dreaming about the 2000s and old Nokia phones. But I couldn’t just go back to Nokia. My iPhone gave me Google Maps, Spotify, Uber and Waymo, Kindle and Audible, ChatGPT and Claude, Whatsapp, Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s real utility to iPhones. If only access to utilities didn’t mean I’d also have access to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I often regretted my time on Twitter and Instagram. It would interrupt my flow states at work and detract from quality time with the people I loved. Even alone time suffered: instead of solitude I found myself checking for notifications. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried and failed to fix this problem three times. Let me enumerate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried self-control but I found myself outmatched. On the surface the solution feels simple: why not just stop using distracting apps? For me using self-control here was like a hunter-gatherer using a club in open battle with a nuclear society. Social media companies spent centuries of human effort figuring out ways to get me to check my phone. If I wanted to win, I would need to use guerrilla methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried Screen Time but it was too easy to ignore. Apple comes with Screen Time. You can set limits, but I found them useless. Once a limit runs out all you need to unlock your distracting app is to press a button. Do this a few times and you no longer notice the button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried switching phones, but couldn’t let go of the long-tail of iPhone apps. There are lots of interesting dumb phones out there. There’s some with e-ink screens that are really cool. But they only have a few apps. There was always some app that I missed. Even with recent Android-based dumbphones, there were still apps that were only available on the iPhone (I am looking at you Things 3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If only I could keep my iPhone, but choose just the apps and the websites that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s where I discovered Apple Configurator. Apple Configurator lets organizations deploy specific restrictions onto iPhones. This is what lets Apple Stores restrict the iPhones on display, so you can’t change their wallpaper to something humorous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configurator is meant for businesses, but nothing stops us from using it personally. And it’s free too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found three advantages to using Configurator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is that there is real friction to making changes. In order to adjust restrictions, you have to physically connect your iPhone to your laptop and open up a kludgy piece of software. This is cumbersome enough that if you have enough willpower to go through with it, you’ll be level-headed enough to not want too. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second is that you can actually disable the App Store! This is a marvelous win. Having an App Store in your home screen is like being dieter with a pastry shop in your kitchen. It’s not a good idea. So no more App Store. And combine that with content filters for websites, and you can really lock down your phone. When you are at your weakest, there’s effectively no way to hack around the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the final win, it’s still an iPhone. This means you can make a dumbphone that fits your needs exactly. There are some apps that sound distracting on the surface, that I just needed plain and simple. For example, my startup uses Discord to talk to users; I want to have it. I want the GitHub app. I want Things3 and Waymo. I want to access specific websites. I can set it all up so my phone is exactly the utility I need it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re getting excited, let me prepare you with two cons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is that you have to factory reset your iPhone. You can only set up Apple Configurator with a completely reset phone. This means the initial setup is annoying and will take you a few hours. But perhaps this a good thing too. If you go through this trouble, you’ll be even more motivated to stick with your choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second is that getting the right setup takes a few weeks, and you may need to rely on others. When you start out you may forget an app or two (or a lot more). For example, I went to my gym the day after I set my restrictions, only to remember that they have a special iPhone to check in. You’ll have lots of little frictions like this. As you do, you’ll improve your configuration so this happens less. It’ll get better but there will still be a long-tail. Maybe you’re at a restaurant and they need you to open a website for example. You may end up having to bug some people around you for their phone. It can be annoying but I haven’t found this to be too troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, it’s 2 months in. Here’s my experience so far:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels great. My phone feels like a utility. I think this is the same kind of change in feeling I would have had if I shifted from eating junk food to healthy food. My phone used to have this gravity: like invariably my attention would shift towards it. Now it just feels like a very useful rock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found ChatGPT and Claude critically useful. Whenever I need some information, I can just ask my LLM, and it can give me a distraction free summary. It helps the long-tail of weird situations too: for example if someone asks me to take a look at a website, I can ask my LLM to scrape it and summarize the details for me. It’s pretty hard to get distracted this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in the the last 2 months I have not felt the desire to remove the restrictions. This wasn’t the case with any previous setup I tried. I think it’s because the friction feels just right. I feel like I can control exactly how my phone should work; there’s just a day or two delay. The delay keeps me level-headed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far the only real unsolved issue I have are related to “semi-important” apps. Consider email. I still need to have access to email, and I want to have notifications enabled so I don’t miss something truly important. But 90% of the emails I get aren’t important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not sure what the solution is to these kind of apps. Maybe I can find a special mail app, that only shows you important emails. If I had something like this I think I would just be over the moon with this setup. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to spend about 4 hours a day on my phone. I’m now down to about 2 hours a day. Looking at the stats, it’s 1 hour of reasonably productive apps, mixed with communication apps (my family lives in a different country, so I make long calls). Overall I don’t regret this time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to do this yourself, it’s going to take a 2-hour initial commitment, and about 2 weeks of tweaks to get everything set up just right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first 2 hours, you will factory reset your phone, and set up Apple Configurator. As those two weeks progress, you’ll tweak your restrictions so you have just the apps and the websites you actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s get into those first 2 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to reset your iPhone. Go to Settings → General → Transfer or Reset iPhone → Erase all content and settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first, and the scariest step. Do it, and you are on the journey 🫡&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now head on over to the Apple and install Apple Configurator. Open the app and click ‘Get Started’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can then prepare your device for configurator. Connect your iPhone to your laptop. You should see it show up in Configurator. Once you do, Right click and click “Prepare”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select “Manual Configuration”, with “Supervise devices” like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can skip “Sign in to Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager”. Just press Next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now enter an “Organization”. Since this is just for yourself, you are an organization of one : ). I use my name:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Configure iOS Setup Assistant”, select “Don’t show any of these steps”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click “Prepare”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aand you’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your phone is now ready for Configurator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we start adding restrictions, let’s set your phone up. Go through Apple’s setup, and make sure you do not restore your iPhone from an iCloud backup. This will undo the supervision stuff we just did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you set things up, go ahead and install all the apps that you’ll need. As a way to jog your memory, here are the apps that I ended up installing:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Click ‘File’ → ‘New Profile’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll make three changes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under ‘General’: For ‘Security’ and ‘Automatically Remove Profile’, set ‘Never’:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Head on over to ‘Content Filter’, and click ‘Configure’. For ‘Filter Type’, select “Specific Websites only”:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;‘Restrictions’ are where we will disable the App Store. Click on ‘Restrictions’ → ‘Configure’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep everything as it is, just uncheck ‘Allow Installing Apps’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that, save your profile. Once we install this profile on your phone…you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s install this profile to your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right click your phone on Configurator, hit ‘Add’ → ‘Profiles’, pick your profile, and you’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you load your phone, you should no longer see an App Store!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a while you may realize you need to install some new apps. When you want to do that, connect your phone, ‘Right click’ → ‘Remove’ → ‘Profile’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you remove your profile, you’re back to a restrictionless world. Make all the changes you need, and then add it back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with that, you have an iPhone dumbphone! I hope it’s as useful for you as it has been for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you follow the instructions and have any issues or changes to make, please send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Microsoft joins World Nuclear Association as it doubles down on small modular reactors and fusion energy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear energy is stepping into big tech’s future electricity strategies&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microsoft is chasing carbon-free energy while data demand keeps rising&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The World Nuclear Association gains unprecedented visibility through Microsoft’s membership&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small modular reactors are being framed as digital infrastructure’s next foundation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has officially joined the World Nuclear Association (WNA), making it the first global technology company of its scale to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement comes at a time when the nuclear industry is attempting to position itself as a necessary partner for both climate targets and the electricity needs of a rapidly expanding digital economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, the move signals a deeper commitment to technologies like small modular reactors and fusion energy as part of its long-term carbon-free ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Balancing climate goals with electricity demand&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electricity consumption tied to data centers is expected to grow sharply in the next decade, putting pressure on utilities and energy-intensive industries alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s decision to align with the World Nuclear Association reflects this trend, as while the company already invests heavily in renewable power sources, nuclear energy offers continuous, high-capacity output that wind and solar cannot always provide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The WNA describes Microsoft’s membership as a "game-changing moment," but such claims will likely face scrutiny given the slow pace of nuclear deployment globally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's membership with the Association is a game-changing moment for our industry," said World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"When one of the world's most innovative technology companies recognizes nuclear energy as essential to its carbon-negative future, it sends a powerful signal to markets, policymakers, and industry leaders worldwide. This partnership will accelerate nuclear deployment at the scale needed to meet both climate goals and the growth in energy demand from data centers."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already signed long-term agreements designed to secure reliable energy supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most notable is a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy, intended to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center, the former Three Mile Island Unit 1 facility in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, the company struck one of the earliest commercial deals with fusion energy company Helion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of its World Nuclear Association membership, Microsoft is expected to work on areas like advanced nuclear technologies, regulatory efficiency, and supply chain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small modular reactors and next-generation systems, including potential fusion breakthroughs, are central to this collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advocates argue that streamlined licensing and stronger global supply chains are critical if nuclear power is to play a larger role in meeting energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, the challenges of cost, construction delays, and political opposition remain major barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s Energy Technology team, led by Dr. Melissa Lott, will take a leading role in shaping how the company participates in the Association’s initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the World Nuclear Association, securing a member like Microsoft brings both visibility and legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, it offers a chance to hedge its energy bets in an uncertain market, but whether this partnership proves transformative depends on the ability of nuclear technologies to deliver results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Nuclear energy isn't just part of the technology sector’s energy strategy, it's essential to it," said León. "Microsoft joining the Association allows greater collaboration between one of the major energy users and the nuclear industry to address the regulatory, technical, and financial challenges to accelerate nuclear deployment. The global nuclear industry isn’t just generating electricity, it’s energizing technology."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Articles /&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Liquid Glass in the Browser: Refraction with CSS and SVG&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple introduced the Liquid Glass effect during WWDC 2025 in June—a stunning UI effect that makes interface elements appear to be made of curved, refractive glass. This article is a hands‑on exploration of how to recreate a similar effect on the web using CSS, SVG displacement maps, and physics-based refraction calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of chasing pixel‑perfect parity, we’ll approximate Liquid Glass, recreating the core refraction and a specular highlight, as a focused proof‑of‑concept you can extend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll build up the effect from first principles, starting with how light bends when passing through different materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome‑only demo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interactive demo at the end currently works in Chrome only (due to SVG filters as backdrop‑filter).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can still read the article and interact with the inline simulations in other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Understanding Refraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refraction is what happens when light changes direction as it passes from one material to another (like from air into glass). This bending occurs because light travels at different speeds through different materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relationship between the incoming and outgoing light angles is described by Snell–Descartes law:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the above interactive diagram, you can see that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When , the light ray passes straight through without bending.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When , the ray bends toward the normal (the imaginary line perpendicular to the surface).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When , the ray bends away from the normal, and depending on the angle of incidence, it may bend so much that it reflects back into the original medium instead of passing through.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is called Total Internal Reflection&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When incident ray is orthogonal to the surface, it passes straight through regardless of refractive indices.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Limitations in this project&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep things focused we avoid complex branches of behavior by constraining the scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ambient medium has (air).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use materials with , and prefer (glass).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only one refraction event (ignore any later exit / second refraction).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Incident rays are always orthogonal to the background plane (no perspective).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Objects are 2D shapes parallel to the background (no perspective).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No gap between objects and background plane (only one refraction).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Circle shapes only in this article:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Extending to other shapes requires preliminary calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Circles let us form rounded rectangles by stretching the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under these assumptions every ray we manipulate has a well-defined refracted direction via Snell's Law, and we simplify a lot our calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Creating the Glass Surface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create our glass effect, we need to define the shape of our virtual glass surface. Think of this like describing the cross-section of a lens or curved glass panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Surface Function&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our glass surface is described by a mathematical function that defines how thick the glass is at any point from its edge to the end of the bezel. This surface function takes a value between (at the outer edge) and (end of bezel, start of flat surface) and returns the height of the glass at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the height we can calculate the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the incoming ray and the normal to the surface at that point. The normal is simply the derivative of the height function at that point, rotated by degrees:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Equations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this article, we will use four different height functions to demonstrate the effect of the surface shape on the refraction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple circular arc → a spherical dome. Easier than the squircle, but the transition to the flat interior is harsher, producing sharper refraction edges—more noticeable when the shape is stretched away from a true circle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uses the Squircle Apple favors: a softer flat→curve transition that keeps refraction gradients smooth even when stretched into rectangles—no harsh interior edges. It also makes the bezel appear optically thinner than its physical size because the flatter outer zones bend light less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concave surface is the complement of the convex function, creating a bowl-like depression. This surface causes light rays to diverge outward, displacing them beyond the glass boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could make the surface function more complex by adding more parameters, but these four already give a good idea of how the surface shape affects the refraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let's see these surface functions in action through interactive ray tracing simulations. The following visualization demonstrates how light rays behave differently as they pass through each surface type, helping us understand the practical implications of our mathematical choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the simulation, we can see that concave surfaces push rays outside the glass; convex surfaces keep them inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to avoid outside displacement because it requires sampling background beyond the object. Apple’s Liquid Glass appears to favor convex profiles (except for the Switch component, covered later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The background arrow indicates displacement—how far a ray lands compared to where it would have landed without glass. Color encodes magnitude (longer → more purple).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a look at symmetry: rays at the same distance from the border share the same displacement magnitude on each side. Compute once, reuse around the bezel/object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Displacement Vector Field&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that calculated the displacement at a distance from border, let's calculate the displacement vector field for the entire glass surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vector field describes at every position on the glass surface how much the light ray is displaced from its original position, and in which direction. In a circle, this displacement is always orthogonal to the border.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Pre-calculating the displacement magnitude&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because we saw that this displacement magnitude is symmetric around the bezel, we can pre-calculate it for a range of distances from the border, on a single radius.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows us to calculate everything in two dimensions once (x and z axis), on one "half-slice" of the object, and we will the rotate these pre-calculated displacements around the z-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual number of samples we need to do on a radius is of 127 ray simulations, and is determined by the constraints of the SVG Displacement Map resolution. (See next section.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Normalizing vectors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the above diagram, the arrows are all scaled down for visibility, so they do not overlap. This is normalization, and is also useful from a technical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use these vectors in a displacement map, we need to normalize them. Normalization means scaling the vectors so that their maximum magnitude is , which allows us to represent them in a fixed range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we calculate the maximum displacement magnitude in our pre-calculated array:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we divide each vector's magnitude by this maximum:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We store &lt;code&gt;maximumDisplacement&lt;/code&gt; as we will need it to re-scale the displacement map back to the actual magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#SVG Displacement Map&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we need to translate our mathematical refraction calculations into something the browser can actually render. We'll use SVG displacement maps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A displacement map is simply an image where each pixel's color tells the browser how far it should find the actual pixel value from its current position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SVG's &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;feDisplacementMap /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; encodes these pixels in a 32 bit RGBA image, where each channel represents a different axis of displacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's up to the user to define which channel corresponds to which axis, but it is important to understand the constraint: Because each channel is 8 bits, the displacement is limited to a range of -128 to 127 pixels in each direction. (256 values possible in total). 128 is the neutral value, meaning no displacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SVG filters can only use images as displacement maps, so we need to convert our displacement vector field into an image format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;feDisplacementMap /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; uses the red channel for the X axis and the green channel for the Y axis. The blue and alpha channels are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Red (X) and Green (Y) channels are 8‑bit values (0–255). Interpreted without any extra scaling, they map linearly to a normalized displacement in [−1, 1], with 128 as the neutral value (no displacement):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt; attribute of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;feDisplacementMap /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; multiplies this normalized amount:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because our vectors are normalized using the maximum possible displacement (in pixels) as the unit, we can reuse that maximum directly as the filter’s &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also animate &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt; to fade the effect in/out—no need to recompute the map (useful for artistic control even if not physically exact).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Vector to Red-Green values&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To convert our displacement vector field into a displacement map, we need to convert each vector into a color value. The red channel will represent the X component of the vector, and the green channel will represent the Y component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We currently have polar coordinates (angle and magnitude) for each vector, so we need to convert them to Cartesian coordinates (X and Y) before mapping them to the red and green channels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because we normalised our vectors already, &lt;code&gt;magnitude&lt;/code&gt; here is between 0 and 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From here, we just remap the values to the range of 0 to 255 for the red and green channels:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After converting every vector in the map to color value, we get an image that can be used as a displacement map in the SVG filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Playground&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This playground applies the SVG displacement filter to a simple scene and lets you tweak surface shape, bezel width, glass thickness, and effect scale. Watch how these inputs change the refraction field, the generated displacement map, and the final rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Surface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Controls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Radius Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Displacement Map&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Radius Displacements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Preview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Specular Highlight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final piece of our Liquid Glass effect is the specular highlight—those bright, shiny edges you see on real glass objects when light hits them at certain angles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way Apple implements it seems to be a simple rim light effect, where the highlight appears around the edges of the glass object, and its intensity varies based on the angle of the surface normal relative to a fixed light direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Combining Refraction and Specular Highlight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the final SVG filter, we combine both the displacement map for refraction and the specular highlight effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both are loaded as separate &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;feImage /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements, and then combined using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;feBlend /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to overlay the highlight on top of the refracted image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this part is actually the most "creative" part of the effect, and it's just by tweaking the number of filters, and their parameters, that you can get a variety of different looks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#SVG Filter as &lt;code&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the part where cross-browser compatibility ends. Only Chrome currently supports using SVG filters as &lt;code&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/code&gt;, which is essential for applying the Liquid Glass effect to UI components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: The backdrop-filter dimensions does not adjust automatically to the element size, so you need to ensure that your filter images fit the size of your elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have all the pieces in place, we can create components that use this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Bringing It All Together: Real UI Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our refraction math and displacement maps working, let's see how this translates to actual UI components you might use in an application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome‑specific demo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome allows using SVG filters as &lt;code&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/code&gt;, which
isn’t part of the CSS spec.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above, we used regular &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; so it’s viewable in
Safari/Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next components use &lt;code&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/code&gt;, so they’re
Chrome‑only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal won't be to create real components for production, but just to get a taste of how the effect looks in different UI elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Magnifying Glass&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This component actually uses two displacement maps: one for the refraction on the sides, and one for the zooming, which has a stronger refraction effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also plays with shadows and scaling to create a more dynamic, interactive effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Liquid Glass—Precision Lens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drag the capsule to bend the page. This lens is a compact SVG displacement rig that refracts whatever sits beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The field comes from a rounded bezel profile; pixels are pushed along its gradient, then topped with a subtle specular bloom for depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sweep across strong edges—high contrast makes the bend snap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Searchbox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Switch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This uses a lip bezel, which makes the surface convex on the outside and concave in the middle. This makes the center slider zoomed out, while the edges refract the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Slider&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slider allows you to see the current level through the glass, while the sides refract the background. It uses a convex bezel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Music Player&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This fake music player UI tries to mimic the look of Apple Music’s Liquid Glass panels, using a convex bezel and a subtle specular highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It relies on the iTunes Search API to fetch album art and song details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This prototype distills Apple’s Liquid Glass into real‑time refraction plus a simple highlight. It’s flexible, but still Chrome‑bound—only Chromium exposes SVG filters as &lt;code&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/code&gt;. That said, it’s already viable inside Chromium‑based runtimes like Electron, elsewhere you could fake a softer fallback with layered blur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treat this strictly as experimental. Dynamic shape/size changes are currently costly because nearly every tweak (besides animating &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;filter /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; props, like &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt;) forces a full displacement map rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code needs a cleanup pass and perf work before any possible open‑source release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my first post—I'd genuinely love any feedback, ideas, critiques, or suggestions. If it sparked a thought or you know someone who'd enjoy this kind of deep‑dive, feel free to pass it along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Strong Eventual Consistency - The Big Idea behind CRDTs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRDTs. Data structures that can be replicated across multiple nodes, edited independently, merged back together, and it all just works. But collaborative document editing and multiplayer TODO lists are just the tip of the iceberg - I believe the big application is distributed databases, and for that we need to talk about consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRDTs are a tool for Strong Eventual Consistency. Let's start with the definition of normal Eventual Consistency1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Eventual Delivery&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;An update delivered to one node will eventually reaches all nodes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Eventual Convergence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will eventually have the same state.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) replaces Eventual Convergence with Strong Convergence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Strong Convergence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will have the same state.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spot the difference! In SEC two replicas have the same state as soon as the updates are processed, not eventually. If multiple nodes are updated independently, there will be conflicts - this is inevitable. What SEC guarantees is that these conflicts are solved automatically and deterministically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has massive implications. SEC means low latency, because nodes don't need to coordinate to handle reads and writes. It means incredible fault tolerance - every single node in the system bar one could simultaneously crash, and reads and writes could still happen normally. And it means nodes still function properly if they're offline or split from the network for arbitrary time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong Eventual Consistency is Eventual Consistency that works. If you're doing local first, or low latency geo-replicated systems - accept no substitute. This is the context I think we should see CRDTs in - building blocks of Strongly Eventually Consistent systems. CRDTs as application state as one thing, CRDTs as entire databases are quite another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phishing NPM package authors continues, unsurprisingly. The stakes are not high enough to switch from phishing to anything more advanced (like https://xkcd.com/538/) but seeing article blurbs say "Supply chain Attack" next to "These packages generally receive 2-3 billion downloads per week." might finally be enough to make an impression, one hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a detailed analysis of the attack, there's plenty of that already. If you're looking for one, visit our friends at https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, let's look at how you could have a compromised dependency like that get into your app and be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the compromised packages was &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; and I'll use that as an example going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if an app uses &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; in the browser, it will override &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;window.ethereum.request&lt;/code&gt; and whenever it finds a transaction being sent, it'll replace the target address with one of the malware author's addresses that looks most alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won't go into this either, but you can take a look at the summary of "donations" some other friends linked to here: https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/61fbc095-f19b-479d-a037-5469aba332ab&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty low impact for an attack this big. Some of it seems to be people mocking the malware author with worthless transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say we have an app. The app allows the user to send a meaningless transaction to themselves. Don't expect it to make sense. It also uses &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; because otherwise we'd have nothing to demo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const isArrayish = require("is-arrayish");

const button = document.createElement("button");
button.textContent = "Send ETH Transaction";
document.body.appendChild(button);

button.addEventListener("click", async () =&amp;gt; {
  const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
    method: "eth_requestAccounts",
  });
  if (!isArrayish(accounts)) {
    throw new Error("Accounts response must be array-like");
  }
  const myAddr = accounts[0];

  const txHash = await window.ethereum.request({
    method: "eth_sendTransaction",
    params: [
      {
        value: "0x5af3107a4000",
        from: myAddr,
        to: myAddr,
      },
    ],
  });
  console.log("Transaction sent:", txHash);
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now after you update &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; to 0.3.3 and rebuild the project, you might notice a slight difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your project was set up with LavaMoat, you'd be using a policy to decide which package is allowed access to what. More about policies in the guide&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With LavaMoat, all &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; can do is fail:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;TypeError: Cannot define property fetch, object is not extensible
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BTW, If the malware was written a little better to avoid detection and fail silently, the functionality of the app would be fully restored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To protect the project, @lavamoat/webpack was used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, what it does is: it puts modules from every dependency in a separate lexical global context that we call &lt;code&gt;Compartment&lt;/code&gt; and only allows access to globals that the policy lists. I also controls which packages can import which other packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the project dependency gets updated to contain malicious code, the policy will not allow it to access any globals or imports it didn't use before.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By EDFL, the achievable reliability is bounded by:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus the hallucination risk (error) is bounded by &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For target hallucination rate &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Bits-to-Trust: &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\mathrm{B2T} = \mathrm{KL}(\mathrm{Ber}(1-h^*) | \mathrm{Ber}(q_{\text{lo}}))$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Information Sufficiency Ratio: &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\mathrm{ISR} = \bar{\Delta}/\mathrm{B2T}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; ANSWER iff &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\mathrm{ISR}\ge 1$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;and&lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{\Delta} \ge \mathrm{B2T} + \text{margin}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;(default&lt;code&gt;margin≈0.2&lt;/code&gt;nats)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why two priors? The gate uses worst-case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;math-renderer&gt;$q_{\text{lo}}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;for strict SLA compliance. The RoH bound uses average&lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{q}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;per EDFL theory. This dual approach ensures conservative safety while providing realistic risk bounds.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The toolkit exhibits different behaviors across query types, which is mathematically consistent with the framework:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observation: May abstain despite apparent simplicity&lt;lb/&gt; Explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Models often attempt answers even with masked numbers (pattern recognition)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This yields low information lift &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{\Delta} \approx 0$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;between full prompt and skeletons&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Despite potentially low EDFL risk bound, worst-case prior gate triggers abstention (ISR &amp;lt; 1)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observation: Generally answered with confidence&lt;lb/&gt; Explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Masking entities/dates substantially reduces answer propensity in skeletons&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restoring these yields large &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{\Delta}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;that clears B2T threshold&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System answers with tight EDFL risk bound&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a bug but a feature: The framework prioritizes safety through worst-case guarantees while providing realistic average-case bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Switch Event Measurement&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Use Correct/Incorrect instead of Answer/Refuse for factual QA&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Skeletons without key information rarely yield correct results → large &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{\Delta}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enhance Skeleton Weakening&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Implement mask-aware decision head that refuses on redaction tokens&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Ensures skeletons have strictly lower "Answer" mass than full prompt&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Calibration Adjustments&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Relax &lt;math-renderer&gt;$h^*$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;slightly (e.g., 0.10 instead of 0.05) for higher answer rates&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Reduce margin for less conservative gating&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Increase sampling (&lt;math-renderer&gt;$n=7-10$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;) for stability&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relax &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Provide Evidence&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Adding compact, relevant evidence increases &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{\Delta}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;while preserving bounds&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adding compact, relevant evidence increases &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prompt contains a field like &lt;code&gt;Evidence:&lt;/code&gt;(or JSON keys)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Skeletons erase the evidence content but preserve structure and roles; then permute blocks deterministically (seeded)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decision head: "Answer only if the provided evidence is sufficient; otherwise refuse."&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Weaponizing Ads: How Governments Use Google Ads and Facebook Ads to Wage Propaganda Wars&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2024, the head of the UN’s Gaza aid agency made a disturbing discovery: when people searched for his organization on Google, the top result wasn’t the agency’s own site — it was a paid ad placed by the Israeli government. The ad mimicked a UN website but actually linked to an Israeli government page accusing the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) of supporting terroists (wired.com). “The spread of misinformation &amp;amp; disinformation continues to be used as a weapon in the war in Gaza,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini warned, calling for investigations and stricter regulation of online propaganda (aljazeera.com). His alarm highlights a troubling new reality: digital advertising platforms have become battlefields for influence, where governments and political groups pay to sway public opinion in wars and crises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional propaganda , think radio broadcasts, posters, state TV, has now gone high-tech. Platforms like Google Ads and Facebook (Meta) Ads allow paries to target specific audiences with tailored messages at massive scale. In theory, these companies have policies against hate speech or blatant lies. In practice, recent case studies show that sophisticated misinformation campaigns can exploit loopholes and lax enforcement, reaching millions of people with government-funded narratives. From the Israel–Palestine conflict to Russian and domestic political meddling, paid ads are being weaponized to promote war efforts, demonize opponents, and even undermine institutions like the UN. This article examines how it’s happening, why the platforms permit it, and what ethical and policy questions arise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Digital Propaganda via Paid Ads: A New Front in Information Warfare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paid advertising on Google and Facebook has become a potent tool for political persuasion or manipulation. Unlike organic social media posts (which rely on shares or algorithms), ads can guarantee visibility: if you pay, you reach your target. And the targeting can be extremely granular. Google Ads lets advertisers bid on search keywords or place banner/video ads on websites and YouTube, often filtered by geography or audience interests. Facebook/Meta’s ad system enables micro-targeting by demographics, location, and user interests, while requiring a “paid for by” disclaimer on political ads for transparency. In theory, this gives legitimate political campaigns a way to reach supporters , but it equally gives propagandists a direct channel to the eyeballs of a chosen populace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers note that this capacity can be abused by partisan or state actors to “manipulate or distract citizens with misinformation and government propaganda,” posing serious challenges to democracy (academic.oup.com). A notorious early example was Russia’s Internet Research Agency, which in 2016 created hundreds of fake Facebook accounts and purchased at least $100,000 worth of divisive ads to influence the U.S. election (abcnews.go.com). Many of those ads didn’t mention candidates directly; instead they amplified polarizing messages on issues like immigration and race to inflame social tensions. At the time, Facebook admitted that most of these propaganda ads “did not violate any company policies or laws,” underscoring how unprepared the platform’s rules were (abcnews.go.com). The incident sparked global awareness that paid media ads could be used as a propaganda weapon , and led to new transparency measures like Facebook’s Ads Library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, increased transparency hasn’t prevented the tactic from evolving. Recent conflicts show governments openly turning to ad campaigns as part of their information warfare strategy. Paid ads can be launched rapidly, scaled globally, and tailored to undermine an opponent or shape public perception of a war. Crucially, they also allow a state to influence foreign publics, beyond its own borders, often skirting the line of platform policies and international norms. The sections below explore a timely case study and the broader implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Case Study: Israel’s Paid Propaganda Campaign in the Gaza War&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the clearest illustrations of war propaganda via paid ads is the Israeli government’s online advertising blitz during the 2023–2025 Gaza war. Israel has long engaged in hasbara (Hebrew for “explanation”), a term for state public relations efforts or propaganda (smex.org). But since the war in Gaza, Israel’s use of digital ads has intensified to unprecedented levels (smex.org).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Targeting the UN: Google Ads to Discredit Humanitarians&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In mid-January 2024, staff at UNRWA USA (a U.S.-based fundraising affiliate of the UN agency) noticed something strange: Google searches for “UNRWA” were yielding an ad that looked like it was from UNRWA, but actually led to an Israeli government site (wired.com). Upon investigation, they discovered a months-long Google Ads campaign by the Israeli Government Advertising Agency to discredit UNRWA (wired.com). The Israeli ads, which were clearly labeled as such in Google’s transparency data, appeared on searches for over 300 related keywords, from “UNRWA” to “Gaza aid”, effectively hijacking traffic from people seeking the UN agency (wired.com). The content of the ads and the landing pages was unmistakably propagandistic: the Israeli site alleged that UNRWA was “inseparable from Hamas” and even employed terrorists (wired.com). One ad bluntly asked, “Paychecks for terrorists or humanitarian aid?”, suggesting money given to UNRWA would fund armed militants (abc.net.au).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aim of this campaign was clear: to cut off support and donations to the UN’s relief agency in Gaza. It came at a critical time, as UNRWA was providing life-saving food, water, and medical care to Palestinians under siege. UNRWA’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, blasted Israel’s actions as a “deliberate disinformation campaign” to “dismantle the agency”, warning that smearing a humanitarian organization not only hurts its reputation but “puts the lives of our colleagues on the frontline at serious risk” (abc.net.au). In essence, Israeli authorities were using Google’s advertising system to undermine a UN institution in the middle of a humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s response was relatively hands-off. When UNRWA representatives appealed to Google to stop what they saw as a dangerous misinformation campaign, the company did not immediately take down the ads (wired.com). A Google spokesperson defended that any government may run ads on Google as long as they adhere to our policies, and stated that Google enforces those rules “consistently and without bias” (wired.com). In other words, because the Israeli ads did not overtly violate Google’s ad policies, they were allowed to run. Notably, Google’s ad policies do prohibit misrepresentation, but they do not have a blanket ban on misinformation unless it relates to specific sensitive areas like election integrity (gomixte.com). As Wired reported, Google generally permits questionable claims in ads “unless it undermines participation or trust in an electoral process” (gomixte.com). This loophole meant that propaganda undermining a humanitarian agency , while arguably unethical , wasn’t against the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result: Israel’s anti-UNRWA ads often outcompeted the agency’s own Google ads. From May through July 2024, in head-to-head bidding, the Israeli ads won the top slot 44% of the time (versus UNRWA USA’s ads showing 34% of the time) (wired.com). UNRWA’s team had to spend tens of thousands of donor dollars trying to outbid Israel for visibility (wired.com). This “insidious” campaign, as UNRWA called it, exposed countless Americans and others to one-sided allegations just as they were searching for facts about Gaza relief (wired.com). “I want the public to know what’s happening,” said UNRWA USA director Mara Kronenfeld, “especially at a time when civilian lives are under attack in Gaza” (wired.com).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By late 2024, news investigations across the world had caught on. ABC News in Australia found that those same Israeli ads linking UNRWA to Hamas were appearing on major Australian news sites, served via Google’s display network (abc.net.au). The ads featured a masked militant wearing both the Hamas emblem and an UNRWA headband, visually equating the UN agency with a terror group (abc.net.au). Captions like “UNRWA has alternatives, it must be replaced” were shown next to news articles (abc.net.au). ABC confirmed at least eight such ad variants were targeted specifically at Australian audiences (in English) and noted the campaign ran in multiple languages including German, Italian, French, and Spanish (abc.net.au). This truly was a global propaganda ad campaign, orchestrated by a government via Google’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UNRWA officials, upon learning of the global ads, reiterated that these tactics were “a wider disinformation campaign” by Israel to cripple the agency (abc.net.au). Despite criticism from UN allies (Australia’s Foreign Minister called Israel’s actions “reprehensible” and urged them to stop undermining UNRWA (abc.net.au), the Israeli government showed no signs of relenting. It even escalated measures offline, banning UNRWA operations in Israel, as the online ad offensive continued (abc.net.au)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A coordinated ad push against the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alongside the UNRWA campaign, the Israeli Government Advertising Agency has also targeted the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), an EU-based human-rights nonprofit founded in 2024 to pursue accountability for alleged war crimes in Gaza and named in honor of five-year-old Hind Rajab, whose death became emblematic of the conflict (Hind Rajab Foundation). In Google’s Ads Transparency Center, the agency’s account shows creatives such as “Hind Rajab Foundation — HRF’s disturbing reality” that click through to a government microsite titled “Unmasking the Hind Rajab Foundation,” which portrays HRF as a pseudo-legal front with “extremist” ties (Ads Transparency Center, 2025; Government of Israel). Reporting on Israel’s recent $45 million placement with Google further notes that several ads explicitly link to this “Unmasking” report, indicating a coordinated effort to discredit HRF across search and display (Drop Site News). For context, HRF’s public materials frame the organization as a legal accountability initiative, while the story of Hind Rajab has gained global visibility through Kaouther Ben Hania’s Venice-premiering film The Voice of Hind Rajab, backed by high-profile producers including Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, and Jonathan Glazer, which has amplified awareness of the case well beyond activist circles (Reuters).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flooding Social Media with War Narratives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The attack on UNRWA was just one facet of Israel’s broader digital PR war. Israeli agencies and allied groups pumped out hundreds of ads across Google/YouTube, Facebook/Instagram, and even children’s gaming apps to influence public opinion about the Gaza conflict. David Saranga, head of the Israeli Foreign Ministry’s digital bureau, confirmed that “the footage is part of a larger advocacy drive” in which the ministry spent $15 million on internet ads in just the first few weeks after October 7, 2023 (smex.org). Those ads often contained graphic and emotional imagery, for example, violent scenes and frightened Israeli families, even appearing as pop-ups in kids’ online games, where they left children “shocked and disturbed” (smex.org). Reuters journalists observed some of these graphic video ads playing in European video games used by children, raising serious questions about appropriateness and consent (business-humanrights.org).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Meta’s platforms (Facebook and Instagram), pro-Israel advertising also spiked dramatically. One effort led by a group calling itself “Facts for Peace” spent over $370,000 on Facebook/Instagram ads in a single month (November 2023) to push viral videos framing all support for Palestine as support for Hamas (business-humanrights.org). These ads, which amassed over 21 million views, were crafted to equate the Palestinian cause with barbaric violence. Despite the obviously misleading and inflammatory nature of such content, it spread widely: it was even promoted by right-wing influencers like Ben Shapiro and shared by official Israeli government social media (e.g. the Israeli embassy in Chile) (business-humanrights.org). Meta’s Ad Library showed 213 ads from Facts for Peace, of which only 3 were taken down for policy violations (business-humanrights.org). Meta told investigators that the campaign did not technically break their rules on transparency, since the ads carried a “Paid for by Facts for Peace” disclaimer and the page was authorized for political advertising. However, nowhere did the group disclose its true funding sources or organizers. (Journalists later linked it to a U.S. billionaire funding pro-Israel messaging (business-humanrights.org.) This case shows how easy it is for a new, opaque group to launch a massive political ad campaign and reach millions before anyone can fully scrutinize it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Israeli government entities themselves also ran extensive campaigns on social media. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched at least 75 distinct ads on YouTube alone in the first months of the war (smex.org). Some of these ads featured what observers called incitement to violence. In one video ad, a menacing message declared: “Israel will take every measure necessary to protect our citizens against these barbaric terrorists,” which borders on a call to collective violence (smex.org). YouTube’s political ads policy forbids content that “encourages others to commit violent acts,” yet this ad apparently slipped through (smex.org). On X (formerly Twitter), the Israeli government and military accounts also placed promoted posts with graphic images (e.g. charred buildings and victims), urging support for their military actions (smex.org). Such ads would seem to violate X’s pre-existing ban on state-affiliated media buying ads (a policy originally aimed at propaganda from outlets like Russia’s RT). Nonetheless, these promotions ran, and some critics questioned if Elon Musk’s open support for Israel influenced X’s lax enforcement (smex.org).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By early 2025, reports revealed that Israel had even formalized a multi-million dollar contract with Google to sustain its global propaganda offensive. According to investigative reporting by Drop Site News (and cited by outlets like TRT World), the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office signed a $45 million, six-month deal with Google in June 2025 to run a worldwide advertising blitz downplaying the humanitarian crisis in Gaza (trtworld.com). The campaign kicked off just after Israeli authorities imposed a siege cutting off food, fuel, and medicine to Gaza in March 2025, and as officials worried about “the public relations fallout”. Leaked documents described Google as a “key entity” in Netanyahu’s PR strategy (trtworld.com). Sure enough, soon after, YouTube and display ads proclaiming “there is food in Gaza. Any other claim is a lie” flooded the internet, with one such video, produced by Israel’s Foreign Ministry, racking up over 6 million views via paid promotion (trtworld.com). In effect, Google was being directly paid to broadcast the message that reports of starvation in Gaza were false, despite widespread documentation of severe hunger by the UN and NGOs. Israeli propaganda officials openly characterized these efforts as “hasbara” — literally “propaganda” — in internal communications (trtworld.com). Alongside Google, Israel spent another $3 million on ads on X (Twitter) and $2.1 million on other ad networks to bolster its narrative (trtworld.com).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The impact of Israel’s ad campaign is hard to quantify, but it undoubtedly reached broad swathes of the global public with the government’s perspective. By framing its military operations as justified self-defense and its critics (even humanitarian agencies) as terrorist sympathizers, Israel’s paid ads sought to shore up international support and neutralize opposition. Given that Israel’s security and billions in military aid depend on Western public opinion (smex.org), this digital influence strategy was a logical extension of the war itself. However, it came at the cost of injecting misinformation and extreme bias into the information ecosystem, potentially skewing public perceptions and policy debates. As we’ll see next, this case also exposes worrying gaps in platform policies and ethical oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Policy Gaps, Double Standards, and Ethical Dilemmas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of paid ads for propaganda raises a blunt question: Are Google and Meta actually enforcing their own rules when it comes to wartime disinformation? The evidence from the above case suggests significant gaps and inconsistencies. Despite formal policies against harmful or misleading content, both companies’ systems enabled, and profited from, campaigns that arguably violate the spirit, if not the letter, of those rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Google’s laissez-faire approach to misinformation: Google’s advertising policies forbid certain categories of content (hate speech, explicit incitement to violence, etc.) and ban misrepresenting who you are. But they do not outright ban false or misleading claims in ads except in narrow contexts like election integrity or COVID-19 info (gomixte.com). This is why blatant propaganda, e.g. accusing a UN agency of abetting terror with scant evidence, can pass muster on Google Ads. Google relied on users or affected parties to report problematic ads, and stated it would “take swift action” if actual policy violations were found (wired.com). But in practice, Google did not pro-actively vet the truth of Israeli government claims. The company was, after all, in a business relationship with Israel (not to mention the formal $45M deal) and may have been reluctant to police a powerful client’s messaging beyond basic checks. This hands-off stance highlights a moral gray area: allowing a paying customer to spread potentially dangerous misinformation because it doesn’t fit neatly into a prohibited category. It suggests that platform policy enforcement can be very literal and reactive, leaving ethical judgment by the wayside.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta’s inconsistent enforcement and transparency issues: Facebook/Meta, on paper, has more expansive rules for political ads. They require identity verification for political advertisers and mandate a “Paid for by [Name]” disclosure on each ad. Certain types of violent or hateful content are disallowed even in ads. In the Israel–Gaza context, however, these rules were enforced unevenly. Meta’s own Ads Library data shows a bias: when ads violated policies (e.g. contained hate speech or graphic violence), pro-Palestinian ads were taken down faster and more frequently than pro-Israeli ads (smex.org). SMEX’s analysis of thousands of ads found that Israeli war-cheerleading ads often remained live longer despite breaking rules, whereas ads calling for Gaza humanitarian aid got removed with stricter urgency (smex.org). For example, the “Facts for Peace” videos that implied all Palestinian supporters endorse terror arguably constituted hateful generalization, yet most stayed up until their paid run ended. Meanwhile, at least one civil society test in late 2023 found that Facebook approved ads containing explicit hate speech calling for violence against Palestinians, indicating failures in the automated moderation system (business-humanrights.org). Meta responded that it prioritizes transparency — pointing to the existence of the Ad Library — but researchers found the library frustratingly opaque. Some ads that clearly ran were missing from public search, and crucial data like why an ad was removed or who exactly was targeted were absent (smex.org). Meta shut down useful tools like CrowdTangle (which helped monitor content virality) in 2024, hampering independent oversight (smex.org). All of this suggests that Meta’s professed neutrality masks a deeply flawed system, where enforcement can be influenced by political sensitivities or errors, and where the company’s profit motive in selling ads may conflict with taking decisive action against harmful content.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Double standards for different conflicts: A striking contrast can be seen in how platforms treated Russian state propaganda versus Israeli state propaganda. During Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western tech firms took an unusually hard line against Russia’s online influence operations. Meta banned Russian state media outlets from running ads or monetizing content on its platform and demoted their posts (smex.org). It also aggressively labeled or removed Russian disinformation about the war, under heavy pressure from governments and public opinion. Google similarly demonetized Russian state-affiliated channels (like RT) and limited their reach. These steps were lauded as Big Tech taking a stand against wartime disinformation. Yet, when it came to Israel, engaging in similar behavior, the response was far more lenient. No blanket bans or demonetization were applied to Israeli state entities pushing propaganda, even though some of their content arguably violated the same principles (for instance, denying documented human suffering in Gaza, or using dehumanizing language about “barbaric terrorists” broadly). Observers have pointed out this double standard, noting that platforms seemed willing to bend rules or look the other way for a U.S.-aligned government (smex.org). This inconsistency not only undermines the credibility of platform policies but also raises geopolitical questions: are ethical standards being applied universally, or only when convenient?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Violations of international norms: Beyond platform rules, there’s an argument that some of these ad campaigns tread on international ethical standards or even laws. For example, deliberately spreading false information to obstruct humanitarian aid (as Israel’s anti-UNRWA ads aimed to do) could be seen as running counter to International Humanitarian Law, which seeks to protect aid efforts and civilians during conflict. Incitement to violence against a population is outlawed under the Genocide Convention and other treaties — and while social media ads we’ve discussed stop short of explicit incitement, they foment hatred and misunderstanding that can fuel violence. The UN Secretary-General and other officials have repeatedly condemned the weaponization of disinformation in conflict settings, calling it “destructive” and urging tech companies to clamp down (wired.com) (aljazeera.com). Allowing a state to pay to propagate one-sided or false narratives undermining a UN agency could be seen as abetting an attack on that international institution’s integrity. These are largely uncharted waters, there’s no clear international law for “information warfare”, but the ethical condemnation is growing. As Lazzarini implored, such campaigns “should stop and be investigated”, and social media firms must do more to combat disinformation and hate speech in war (aljazeera.com).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All these issues point back to the central dilemma: What responsibility do the tech giants have when their advertising tools are used to spread propaganda or inflame conflicts? If they act as neutral carriers, they risk facilitating harm; if they intervene, they become arbiters of truth in explosive political situations. The next section looks at how Google, Meta, and others have responded, or failed to respond, and what more could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Responsibility of Tech Companies in Wartime Propaganda&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Major tech companies often insist they are platforms, not publishers, they provide the space, but aren’t responsible for every message that advertisers choose to push. However, the extreme examples we’ve explored put that claim to the test. When a company is paid millions to disseminate content that may be false or harmful, can it really wash its hands of accountability? Here are some considerations and responses from the companies and experts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Official stances and defenses: Google’s official line, as noted, is that it applies its ad policies equally to all, including governments, and will remove ads that violate those policies (wired.com). Implicit in that statement is that Google does not see itself as the arbiter of factual truth in ads, unless a lie crosses certain predefined lines, Google will host it for a paying client. Meta, for its part, touts the transparency of its system. A Meta spokesperson, responding to concerns about the “Facts for Peace” campaign, emphasized that the ads were “clearly labeled with a ‘paid by’ disclaimer” and publicly archived in the Ads Library, implying that this level of transparency exceeds that of TV or print political ads (business-humanrights.org). Meta also points out that it has an Ad Standards enforcement team and that ads violating policies (when caught) are taken down and documented. In practice, as we saw, that enforcement can lag or falter — but the company’s message is that shining light on ads is the solution, rather than heavy-handed censorship.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Profit vs. principle: Critics argue that a big reason these platforms struggle to self-regulate is that they make money from every ad impression. When conflict-related content goes viral, ad spending surges. A joint analysis by CalMatters and The Markup found that after war broke out in Gaza on Oct 7, 2023, Meta saw a major increase in ad revenue related to the conflict (calmatters.org). In October 2023 alone, an estimated $3.1 million was spent on Facebook ads about the Israel–Gaza war, a huge spike compared to previous months (calmatters.org). This includes not just state propaganda but also ads for fundraising, merchandise, and advocacy around the crisis. The point is that war and political violence can become lucrative business for social media companies, something Meta’s own employees have acknowledged internally (Facebook famously admitted that outrage and misinformation drive engagement, which in turn drives ad revenue (calmatters.org). This profit motive can create a perverse disincentive to crack down on borderline content. While $3 million is a drop in the bucket of Meta’s $100+ billion annual revenue, it’s still revenue. And for Google, a $45 million contract from Israel’s government is significant. The companies risk accusations of “conflict profiteering” if they appear to take money to propagate one side’s propaganda. This has led to calls for them to refuse or refund ad buys that clearly aim to deceive or stoke conflict, though such moves remain rare.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Calls for stronger policies: Human rights organizations and digital rights groups are urging the platforms to develop special policies for ads in conflict zones or on politically sensitive issues. For instance, SMEX and others have suggested that in the context of an armed conflict, platforms should implement tailored rules to prevent the spread of hate speech and misinformation via ads, given the real-world stakes (smex.org). Concretely, this could mean temporarily banning state-run or state-funded advertising in active conflict situations, or at least subjecting them to human review and fact-checking. It could also mean disallowing ads that target foreign populations with war propaganda, treating it akin to foreign election interference. Another idea floated by experts is a “circuit breaker” approach: if a sudden war or crisis erupts, platforms might pause all political and issue-based ads in the affected regions until they can ramp up oversight. (Notably, Meta has recently decided to halt all political, electoral, and social issue ads in the entire EU starting in 2025, in response to new regulations (about.fb.com). This broad-brush ban is a compliance move for Europe, but it shows that turning off political ads is technically feasible when mandated.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transparency and researcher access: Many observers argue that if companies won’t ban propaganda ads outright, they should at least empower watchdogs to track and expose them. This means improving their ad transparency tools. Meta’s shutting down of CrowdTangle and the limitations of the Ads Library have drawn heavy criticism (smex.orgsmex.org). Experts like Sam Jeffers of Who Targets Me advocate for more robust disclosures — for example, revealing detailed targeting parameters of political ads (so we know who governments are trying to influence) and keeping archives of removed ads including why they were removed (business-humanrights.org) (smex.org). There are also calls for independent audits of platform algorithms and ad delivery, to see if certain viewpoints are getting amplified unfairly. Ultimately, greater transparency can help civil society and journalists “police” the propaganda if the platforms themselves are slow to do so.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regulatory pressure and international standards: Governments and international bodies are starting to weigh in. The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) and upcoming regulations on political advertising put legal requirements on big platforms to prevent misuse. For example, the DSA requires rapid removal of illegal content (which could include illegal hate speech or incitement in ads) and hefty fines for non-compliance. The EU is also pushing for strict transparency on political ads and even contemplating banning microtargeting for political messages. These rules, though EU-specific, often end up being adopted globally by platforms for simplicity’s sake. Outside of Europe, the lack of regulation has been evident, which is why UN officials like Lazzarini are directly calling for “more regulations for companies… to combat disinformation and hate speech” online (aljazeera.com). We may see moves in the UN or other international forums to establish norms against certain propaganda techniques. In the long run, if self-regulation fails, tech companies might face binding rules prohibiting them from accepting money for ads that undermine peace and truth, a challenging rule to draft, but an increasingly pertinent conversation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The era of governments weaponizing Google and Facebook ads is upon us, raising thorny questions about truth, free speech, and corporate responsibility in the digital age. The case of Israel’s advertising blitz in the Gaza war demonstrates how easily paid platforms can be turned into tools of war propaganda, blasting millions with biased or false narratives at the click of a button. It also shows the real harms at stake: humanitarian aid blocked, democratic institutions undermined, and public discourse polluted. And Israel is not alone, from superpowers to militant groups, many actors have tested the boundaries of online ads to sway hearts and minds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the platforms, this is a moment of reckoning. Can Google and Meta continue to say “we’re just the middleman” while cashing checks for propaganda campaigns? Critics argue that neutrality is not neutral when it enables deception and violence. Yet, deciding where to draw the line is complex. Mistakes or overreach in moderation could themselves be seen as partisan interference. The tightrope between allowing robust political advocacy and preventing harmful propaganda is a difficult one to walk, especially under global scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is clear is that doing nothing is no longer tenable. Sunlight and accountability are the minimum: users deserve to know who is behind the political ads they see and to have confidence that egregious lies or incitements won’t be promoted by the world’s most powerful information platforms. Moving forward, it will likely require a mix of solutions , improved self-governance by tech firms, independent oversight, and smart regulation, to ensure that the tools of modern advertising are not abused to foment conflict or erode democracy. As the saying goes, “In war, truth is the first casualty.” In our digital world, we must decide how much we are willing to let paid algorithms hasten that casualty, or whether we can find ways to uphold truth even amid the fog of online war.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;PRESS RELEASES&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;New Mexico is first state in nation to offer universal child care&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SANTA FE — Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and the New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department announced a historic milestone on Monday: New Mexico will become the first state in the nation to guarantee no-cost universal child care starting Nov. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This groundbreaking new initiative will make child care available to all New Mexicans, regardless of income, by removing income eligibility requirements from the state’s child care assistance program and continuing the waiver of family copayments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation, and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” said Lujan Grisham. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This announcement fulfills the promise made by the governor and the New Mexico Legislature when they created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019. Since then, New Mexico has expanded access to no-cost child care to families with incomes at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, reducing financial strain on tens of thousands of families.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Monday’s announcement universal child care will be extended to every family in the state, regardless of income. This amounts to an average annual family savings of $12,000 per child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“New Mexico is creating the conditions for better outcomes in health, learning, and well-being,” said Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics, public health and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and director of the Center for Healthier Children, Families, and Communities. “Its approach is rooted in data, driven by communities, and becoming a model for the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“By prioritizing public investments in early childhood educators, families, and children, New Mexico continues to lead the way in building a sustainable, affordable, and quality child care and early learning system that helps its communities and economy thrive,” said Michelle Kang, president and CEO of the National Association of the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). “Achieving universal child care will make a huge difference for the state’s children, families, businesses, and educators—and for all of us, by showing that it can be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Families who receive child care assistance report greater financial stability, more time to focus on their children, and the ability to choose higher-quality care settings. Now, every family in New Mexico will have the same opportunity. New Mexico is also taking decisive action to build the supply of infant and toddler care statewide:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Establishing a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to construct, expand, and renovate child care facilities, with an additional $20 million requested in the Fiscal Year 2027 budget.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Targeting growth to focus on care for infants, toddlers, low-income families, and children with special needs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Partnering with employers and school districts to expand child care options for working families.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Launching a statewide campaign to recruit licensed and registered home providers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To support providers, reimbursement rates will rise to reflect the true cost of care.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programs that commit to paying entry-level staff a minimum of $18 per hour and offer 10 hours of care per day, five days a week, will receive an incentive rate. New Mexico estimates an additional 5,000 early childhood professionals are needed to fully achieve a universal system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Early childhood care and education is a public good,” said ECECD Sec. Elizabeth Groginsky. “By providing universal access and improving pay for our early childhood workforce, we are easing financial pressure on families, strengthening our economy, and helping every child learn in safe, nurturing environments. This is the kind of investment that builds equity today and prosperity for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With universal child care, New Mexico is leading the nation by showing that what is best for children and families is also the smartest investment for long-term prosperity—building a stronger future for every community in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A novel DRAM memory cell with two IGZO-based transistors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bit cell of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), the main memory within traditional compute architectures, is conceptually very simple. It consists of one capacitor (1C) and one silicon (Si)-based transistor (1T). While the capacitor’s role is to store a charge, the transistor is used to access the capacitor, either to read how much charge is stored or to store a new charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, bit cell density scaling allowed the industry to introduce subsequent generations of DRAM technology and cope with the growing demand for DRAM. But since about 2015, DRAM memory technology has struggled to keep pace with the performance improvement of the processor’s logic part: scaling, cost, and power efficiency issues form the building blocks of a rising ‘memory wall’. The large capacitor constrains scalability and 3D integration of the 1T1C bit cell, the ultimate path towards high-density DRAM. In addition, as the access transistor gets smaller, it provides an increasingly large leakage path for the capacitor’s charge to drain away. This lowers the data retention time and requires DRAM cells to be refreshed more frequently – impacting the power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020, imec reported a novel DRAM bit cell concept that can solve these two issues in one go: a bit cell made up of two thin-film transistors (2T, one for read, one for write) and no capacitor (0C) [1]. The conduction channel of the thin-film transistors is composed of an oxide semiconductor, such as indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO). Due to its wide bandgap, IGZO-based transistors have an extremely low off current, benefitting the memory’s retention time, refresh rate, and power consumption. The longer retention time also relaxes the requirement for the storage capacitance, allowing the parasitic capacitance of the read transistor to take over the role of the storage element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, fabricating an IGZO 2T0C bit cell is simpler and more cost-effective than traditional cells. Other than Si, IGZO material can be deposited at relatively low temperatures, making it compatible with back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing. This opens doors to new DRAM architectures. First, it allows the DRAM periphery – the logic transistors that enable the full functionality of the DRAM chip – to be moved under the DRAM memory array instead of residing next to it. This reduces the footprint of the DRAM memory chip and makes connections between the array and periphery more efficient. In this configuration, the 2T0C DRAM bit cells are integrated into the peri’s BEOL, which is allowed by the properties of the IGZO material.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the novel bit cell paves the way for stacked configurations, providing an additional increase in density. Either ‘2D’ or ‘true 3D’ stacking can be envisioned. With 2D stacking, several layers with ‘planar’ DRAM memory arrays are stacked on top of each other. With 3D stacking, the transistors that make up the 2T0C bit cell are stacked and monolithically integrated into vertically aligned plugs inspired by 3D NAND technology. The ability to deposit IGZO conformally in these high-aspect-ratio plugs, enabled by the technique of atomic layer deposition (ALD), is a key enabler of this 3D structure. These stacked configurations will help tear down the memory wall, allowing DRAM memories to continue playing a crucial role in data-intensive applications such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Implementing the two transistors on different levels (stacked 2T0C) has an additional benefit. A low-off-current oxide semiconductor channel is only fundamental in the write transistor to ensure long retention. For the read transistor, on current is the critical parameter, as it drives the read time, and high-mobility channel materials can be considered. The two transistors can thus be optimized separately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First ‘conceptual’ demonstration of an IGZO 2T0C DRAM bit cell&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After pioneering the concept, imec provided the first experimental demonstration of a functional 2T0C DRAM cell at the 2020 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) [1]. Thanks to a low (extracted) off current of 3x10-19A/µm, these first 2T0C DRAM cells exhibited a retention time &amp;gt;400s, about 1,000 times longer than typical DRAM refresh times. The results were obtained after scaling and optimizing IGZO-based thin-film transistors processed on 300mm wafers. Optimizations were directed towards suppressing the impact of oxygen and hydrogen defects, one of the main challenges for developing good-performing IGZO-based transistors. Optimized transistors with a 45nm gate length were then integrated into a 2T0C DRAM bit cell architecture, where the parasitic capacitance of the read transistor served as the storage element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you want regular updates on imec’s semiconductor research?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Improving performance through bit cell engineering: an overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, imec started to explore the knobs that allow the boosting of 2T0C DRAM density and improve performance and reliability metrics such as off current, data retention, endurance, on current, and threshold voltage (stability). In 2021 at IEDM, imec researchers presented a much-improved IGZO-based 2T0C DRAM bit cell with &amp;gt;1000s retention time and practically unlimited endurance (&amp;gt;1011 read and write cycles) with &amp;lt;10ns write time [2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These breakthrough results followed an optimization of the IGZO transistor’s material stack and integration scheme: a gate-last approach with buried oxygen tunnel and self-aligned contacts combined with a scaled gate dielectric (Al2O3) thickness. Implementing the buried oxide tunnel in combination with an anneal in an O2 ambient reduced the oxygen-vacancy concentration in the IGZO channel, benefitting on and off currents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This IGZO-DRAM technology set the stage for more aggressive DRAM scaling. The gate length of the IGZO transistor was scaled down to 14nm while still preserving &amp;gt;100s retention. The researchers also showed a variant of the 2T0C DRAM cell with much reduced IGZO layer thickness (5nm). This eliminated the need for an oxygen tunnel and O2 anneal step, leading to a simplified process flow. Imec also demonstrated functional transistors with conformally deposited thin IGZO channels (5nm, through ALD), a stepping stone towards 3D DRAM integration. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More recently, imec used the reactive ion etch (RIE) technique instead of the commonly used ion beam etch (IBE) for patterning the active module of the 2T0C transistor. RIE allows for patterning at tiny dimensions (sub-100nm) with limited damage, further reducing area consumption. Moreover, using these transistors in 2T0C DRAM bit cells led to a much-improved retention time of &amp;gt;4.5 hours, thanks to an effective suppression of extrinsic leakage paths on the sidewalls of the transistor [3].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The potential of imec’s disruptive DRAM concept triggered interest from universities, research institutes, and companies worldwide. Several research groups started investigating other bit cell configurations, transistor performance ‘boosters,’ and alternative oxide semiconductor materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, IMECAS (Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences), publishing about 2T0C IGZO DRAM since 2021, demonstrated an alternative 2T0C configuration to benefit multibit operation [4]. Later, they were the first to show transistors with a vertically integrated IGZO channel. The ability to monolithically stack the ‘vertical’ read and write transistors enables area-efficient 4F2 2D DRAM cell configurations (F being the minimum feature size for a given technology node) [5]. Macronix also implemented a 3D 2T0C bit cell with gate-around (GA) and channel-all-around (CAA) IGZO FETs [6]. Peking University optimized IGZO transistors based on material stack engineering, which enhanced 2T0C DRAM cell performance [7].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thin-film transistors with oxide semiconductor channel materials other than IGZO are also being considered. One promising material is W-doped indium oxide (IWO), as showcased by Notre Dame University [8]. Stanford University initially considered indium-tin-oxide (ITO) for 2T0C implementation [9]. In 2024, in collaboration with TSMC, they also used IWO to build an n-type thin-film transistor. In addition, they were the first to combine the IWO n-type transistor with a p-type transistor also made of an oxide semiconductor (tin-oxide (SnO) in this case) for improved performance and reduction of coupling effects [10]. Most oxide semiconductor transistors are inherently n-type, which is why 2T0C DRAM bit cells usually implement two n-type transistors, for reading and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The path to industry-viable IGZO-based 3D DRAM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2T0C IGZO-DRAM has recently been added to the long-term DRAM technology roadmap, according to a 2024 report of Yole Intelligence. The technology is envisioned as one of the possible approaches toward a much-desired 3D DRAM. Moreover, the demand for AI on edge devices is expected to surge in the coming years, generating the need for high-density embedded DRAM (eDRAM). The capacitor-less IGZO-DRAM technology is a very attractive candidate for this application. Building on its pioneering activities, imec started developing BEOL-compatible eDRAM implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, one key concern has made the memory industry hesitant to adopt IGZO-based DRAM technology: reliability. The n-type IGZO transistors mainly degrade because of the positive bias temperature instability (PBTI), which is manifested as an undesirable shift of the device threshold voltage and a decrease in the drain current. Worrisome is the hydrogen-related contribution to PBTI, a problem less familiar to the chip industry. Through the years, imec has made considerable progress in assessing, understanding, and modeling reliability failure, paving the way to building reliable IGZO transistors with a target lifetime of five years [11,12].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Go Blog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A new experimental Go API for JSON&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a simple data interchange format. Almost 15 years ago, we wrote about support for JSON in Go, which introduced the ability to serialize and deserialize Go types to and from JSON data. Since then, JSON has become the most popular data format used on the Internet. It is widely read and written by Go programs, and encoding/json now ranks as the 5th most imported Go package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, packages evolve with the needs of their users, and &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt; is no exception. This blog post is about Go 1.25’s new
experimental &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/v2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/jsontext&lt;/code&gt; packages,
which bring long-awaited improvements and fixes.
This post argues for a new major API version,
provides an overview of the new packages,
and explains how you can make use of it.
The experimental packages are not visible by default and
may undergo future API changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Problems with &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt; has held up well.
The idea of marshaling and unmarshaling arbitrary Go types
with some default representation in JSON, combined with the ability to
customize the representation, has proven to be highly flexible.
However, in the years since its introduction,
various users have identified numerous shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Behavior flaws&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are various behavioral flaws in &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Imprecise handling of JSON syntax: Over the years, JSON has seen increased standardization in order for programs to properly communicate. Generally, decoders have become stricter at rejecting ambiguous inputs, to reduce the chance that two implementations will have different (successful) interpretations of a particular JSON value.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;currently accepts invalid UTF-8, whereas the latest Internet Standard (RFC 8259) requires valid UTF-8. The default behavior should report an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8, instead of introducing silent data corruption, which may cause problems downstream.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;currently accepts objects with duplicate member names. RFC 8259 does not specify how to handle duplicate names, so an implementation is free to choose an arbitrary value, merge the values, discard the values, or report an error. The presence of a duplicate name results in a JSON value without a universally agreed upon meaning. This could be exploited by attackers in security applications and has been exploited before (as in CVE-2017-12635). The default behavior should err on the side of safety and reject duplicate names.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaking nilness of slices and maps: JSON is often used to communicate with programs using JSON implementations that do not allow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;to be unmarshaled into a data type expected to be a JSON array or object. Since&lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;marshals a nil slice or map as a JSON&lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, this may lead to errors when unmarshaling by other implementations. A survey indicated that most Go users prefer that nil slices and maps are marshaled as an empty JSON array or object by default.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Case-insensitive unmarshaling: When unmarshaling, a JSON object member name is resolved to a Go struct field name using a case-insensitive match. This is a surprising default, a potential security vulnerability, and a performance limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inconsistent calling of methods: Due to an implementation detail,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt;methods declared on a pointer receiver are inconsistently called by&lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;. While regarded as a bug, this cannot be fixed as too many applications depend on the current behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;API deficiencies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The API of &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt; can be tricky or restrictive:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to correctly unmarshal from an&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;io.Reader&lt;/code&gt;. Users often write&lt;code&gt;json.NewDecoder(r).Decode(v)&lt;/code&gt;, which fails to reject trailing junk at the end of the input.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Options can be set on the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Encoder&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Decoder&lt;/code&gt;types, but cannot be used with the&lt;code&gt;Marshal&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Unmarshal&lt;/code&gt;functions. Similarly, types implementing the&lt;code&gt;Marshaler&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Unmarshaler&lt;/code&gt;interfaces cannot make use of the options and there is no way to plumb options down the call stack. For example, the&lt;code&gt;Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields&lt;/code&gt;option loses its effect when calling a custom&lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt;method.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Compact&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Indent&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;HTMLEscape&lt;/code&gt;functions write to a&lt;code&gt;bytes.Buffer&lt;/code&gt;instead of something more flexible like a&lt;code&gt;[]byte&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;io.Writer&lt;/code&gt;. This limits the usability of those functions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Performance limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setting aside internal implementation details, the public API commits it to certain performance limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;MarshalJSON: The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt;interface method forces the implementation to allocate the returned&lt;code&gt;[]byte&lt;/code&gt;. Also, the semantics require that&lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;verify that the result is valid JSON and also to reformat it to match the specified indentation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;UnmarshalJSON: The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt;interface method requires that a complete JSON value be provided (without any trailing data). This forces&lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;to parse the JSON value to be unmarshaled in its entirety to determine where it ends before it can call&lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt;. Afterwards, the&lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt;method itself must parse the provided JSON value again.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of streaming: Even though the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Encoder&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Decoder&lt;/code&gt;types operate on an&lt;code&gt;io.Writer&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;io.Reader&lt;/code&gt;, they buffer the entire JSON value in memory. The&lt;code&gt;Decoder.Token&lt;/code&gt;method for reading individual tokens is allocation-heavy and there is no corresponding API for writing tokens.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the implementation of a &lt;code&gt;MarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt; method
recursively calls the &lt;code&gt;Marshal&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Unmarshal&lt;/code&gt; function,
then the performance becomes quadratic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Trying to fix &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt; directly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introducing a new, incompatible major version of a package is a heavy consideration. If possible, we should try to fix the existing package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it is relatively easy to add new features, it is difficult to change existing features. Unfortunately, these problems are inherent consequences of the existing API, making them practically impossible to fix within the Go 1 compatibility promise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could in principle declare separate names, such as &lt;code&gt;MarshalV2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;UnmarshalV2&lt;/code&gt;,
but that is tantamount to creating a parallel namespace within the same package.
This leads us to &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/v2&lt;/code&gt; (henceforth called &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;),
where we can make these changes within a seperate &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; namespace
in contrast to &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt; (henceforth called &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Planning for &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/v2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The planning for a new major version of &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt; spanned years.
In late 2020, spurred on by the inability to fix issues in the current package,
Daniel Martí (one of the maintainers of &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;) first drafted his
thoughts on what a hypothetical &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; package should look like.
Separately, after previous work on the Go API for Protocol Buffers,
Joe Tsai was disapppointed that the &lt;code&gt;protojson&lt;/code&gt; package
needed to use a custom JSON implementation because &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt; was
neither capable of adhering to the stricter JSON standard that the
Protocol Buffer specification required,
nor of efficiently serializing JSON in a streaming manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Believing a brighter future for JSON was both beneficial and achievable, Daniel and Joe joined forces to brainstorm on &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; and
started to build a prototype
(with the initial code being a polished version of the JSON serialization logic from the Go protobuf module).
Over time, a few others (Roger Peppe, Chris Hines, Johan Brandhorst-Satzkorn, and Damien Neil)
joined the effort by providing design review, code review, and regression testing.
Many of the early discussions are publicly available in our
recorded meetings and
meeting notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work has been public since the beginning, and we increasingly involved the wider Go community, first with a GopherCon talk and discussion posted in late 2023, formal proposal posted in early 2025, and most recently adopting &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/v2&lt;/code&gt; as a Go experiment
(available in Go 1.25) for wider-scale testing by all Go users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; effort has been going on for 5 years,
incorporating feedback from many contributors and also gaining valuable
empirical experience from use in production settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that it’s largely been developed and promoted by people not employed by Google, demonstrating that the Go project is a collaborative endeavor with a thriving global community dedicated to improving the Go ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building on &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/jsontext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before discussing the &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; API, we first introduce the experimental
&lt;code&gt;encoding/json/jsontext&lt;/code&gt; package
that lays the foundation for future improvements to JSON in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JSON serialization in Go can be broken down into two primary components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;syntactic functionality that is concerned with processing JSON based on its grammar, and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;semantic functionality that defines the relationship between JSON values and Go values.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use the terms “encode” and “decode” to describe syntactic functionality and the terms “marshal” and “unmarshal” to describe semantic functionality. We aim to provide a clear distinction between functionality that is purely concerned with encoding versus that of marshaling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This diagram provides an overview of this separation. Purple blocks represent types, while blue blocks represent functions or methods. The direction of the arrows approximately represents the flow of data. The bottom half of the diagram, implemented by the &lt;code&gt;jsontext&lt;/code&gt; package,
contains functionality that is only concerned with syntax,
while the upper half, implemented by the &lt;code&gt;json/v2&lt;/code&gt; package,
contains functionality that assigns semantic meaning to syntactic data
handled by the bottom half.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic API of &lt;code&gt;jsontext&lt;/code&gt; is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;package jsontext

type Encoder struct { ... }
func NewEncoder(io.Writer, ...Options) *Encoder
func (*Encoder) WriteValue(Value) error
func (*Encoder) WriteToken(Token) error

type Decoder struct { ... }
func NewDecoder(io.Reader, ...Options) *Decoder
func (*Decoder) ReadValue() (Value, error)
func (*Decoder) ReadToken() (Token, error)

type Kind byte
type Value []byte
func (Value) Kind() Kind
type Token struct { ... }
func (Token) Kind() Kind
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;jsontext&lt;/code&gt; package provides functionality for interacting with JSON
at a syntactic level and derives its name from
RFC 8259, section 2
where the grammar for JSON data is literally called &lt;code&gt;JSON-text&lt;/code&gt;.
Since it only interacts with JSON at a syntactic level,
it does not depend on Go reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Encoder&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;Decoder&lt;/code&gt;
provide support for encoding and decoding JSON values and tokens.
The constructors
accept variadic options
that affect the particular behavior of encoding and decoding.
Unlike the &lt;code&gt;Encoder&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Decoder&lt;/code&gt; types declared in &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;,
the new types in &lt;code&gt;jsontext&lt;/code&gt; avoid muddling the distinction between syntax and
semantics and operate in a truly streaming manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A JSON value is a complete unit of data and is represented in Go as a named &lt;code&gt;[]byte&lt;/code&gt;.
It is identical to &lt;code&gt;RawMessage&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;.
A JSON value is syntactically composed of one or more JSON tokens.
A JSON token is represented in Go as the opaque &lt;code&gt;Token&lt;/code&gt; type
with constructors and accessor methods.
It is analogous to &lt;code&gt;Token&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;
but is designed represent arbitrary JSON tokens without allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To resolve the fundamental performance problems with the &lt;code&gt;MarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt; interface methods,
we need an efficient way of encoding and decoding JSON
as a streaming sequence of tokens and values.
In &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;, we introduce the &lt;code&gt;MarshalJSONTo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSONFrom&lt;/code&gt; interface methods
that operate on an &lt;code&gt;Encoder&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Decoder&lt;/code&gt;, allowing the methods’ implementations
to process JSON in a purely streaming manner. Thus, the &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; package need not
be responsible for validating or formatting a JSON value returned by &lt;code&gt;MarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt;,
nor would it need to be responsible for determining the boundaries of a JSON value
provided to &lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt;. These responsibilities belong to the &lt;code&gt;Encoder&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Decoder&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introducing &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/v2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on the &lt;code&gt;jsontext&lt;/code&gt; package, we now introduce the experimental
&lt;code&gt;encoding/json/v2&lt;/code&gt; package.
It is designed to fix the aforementioned problems,
while remaining familiar to users of the &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; package.
Our goal is that usages of &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; will operate mostly the same if directly migrated to &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, we will primarily cover the high-level API of &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;.
For examples on how to use it, we encourage readers to
study the examples in the &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; package or
read Anton Zhiyanov’s blog covering the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic API of &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;package json

func Marshal(in any, opts ...Options) (out []byte, err error)
func MarshalWrite(out io.Writer, in any, opts ...Options) error
func MarshalEncode(out *jsontext.Encoder, in any, opts ...Options) error

func Unmarshal(in []byte, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalRead(in io.Reader, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalDecode(in *jsontext.Decoder, out any, opts ...Options) error
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Marshal&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;Unmarshal&lt;/code&gt; functions
have a signature similar to &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;, but accept options to configure their behavior.
The &lt;code&gt;MarshalWrite&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;UnmarshalRead&lt;/code&gt; functions
directly operate on an &lt;code&gt;io.Writer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;io.Reader&lt;/code&gt;,
avoiding the need to temporarily construct an &lt;code&gt;Encoder&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Decoder&lt;/code&gt;
just to write or read from such types.
The &lt;code&gt;MarshalEncode&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;UnmarshalDecode&lt;/code&gt; functions
operate on a &lt;code&gt;jsontext.Encoder&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jsontext.Decoder&lt;/code&gt; and
is actually the underlying implementation of the previously mentioned functions.
Unlike &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;, options are a first-class argument to each of the marshal and unmarshal functions,
greatly extending the flexibility and configurability of &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;.
There are several options available
in &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; which are not covered by this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Type-specified customization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; allows types to define their own JSON representation
by satisfying particular interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type Marshaler interface {
    MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
}
type MarshalerTo interface {
    MarshalJSONTo(*jsontext.Encoder) error
}

type Unmarshaler interface {
    UnmarshalJSON([]byte) error
}
type UnmarshalerFrom interface {
    UnmarshalJSONFrom(*jsontext.Decoder) error
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Marshaler&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;Unmarshaler&lt;/code&gt; interfaces
are identical to those in &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;.
The new &lt;code&gt;MarshalerTo&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;UnmarshalerFrom&lt;/code&gt; interfaces
allow a type to represent itself as JSON using a &lt;code&gt;jsontext.Encoder&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;jsontext.Decoder&lt;/code&gt;.
This allows options to be forwarded down the call stack, since options
can be retrieved via the &lt;code&gt;Options&lt;/code&gt; accessor method on the &lt;code&gt;Encoder&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Decoder&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the &lt;code&gt;OrderedObject&lt;/code&gt; example
for how to implement a custom type that maintains the ordering of JSON object members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Caller-specified customization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;, the caller of &lt;code&gt;Marshal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Unmarshal&lt;/code&gt; can also specify
a custom JSON representation for any arbitrary type,
where caller-specified functions take precedence over type-defined methods
or the default representation for a particular type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;func WithMarshalers(*Marshalers) Options

type Marshalers struct { ... }
func MarshalFunc[T any](fn func(T) ([]byte, error)) *Marshalers
func MarshalToFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Encoder, T) error) *Marshalers

func WithUnmarshalers(*Unmarshalers) Options

type Unmarshalers struct { ... }
func UnmarshalFunc[T any](fn func([]byte, T) error) *Unmarshalers
func UnmarshalFromFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Decoder, T) error) *Unmarshalers
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MarshalFunc&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;MarshalToFunc&lt;/code&gt;
construct a custom marshaler that can be passed to a &lt;code&gt;Marshal&lt;/code&gt; call
using &lt;code&gt;WithMarshalers&lt;/code&gt; to override the marshaling of particular types.
Similarly,
&lt;code&gt;UnmarshalFunc&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;UnmarshalFromFunc&lt;/code&gt;
support similar customization for &lt;code&gt;Unmarshal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ProtoJSON&lt;/code&gt; example
demonstrates how this feature allows serialization of all
&lt;code&gt;proto.Message&lt;/code&gt; types
to be handled by the &lt;code&gt;protojson&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Behavior differences&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; aims to behave mostly the same as &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;,
its behavior has changed in some ways
to address problems in &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;, most notably:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;reports an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;reports an error if a JSON object contains a duplicate name.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;marshals a nil Go slice or Go map as an empty JSON array or JSON object, respectively.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;unmarshals a JSON object into a Go struct using a case-sensitive match from the JSON member name to the Go field name.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;redefines the&lt;code&gt;omitempty&lt;/code&gt;tag option to omit a field if it would have encoded as an “empty” JSON value (which are&lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;""&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;reports an error when trying to serialize a&lt;code&gt;time.Duration&lt;/code&gt;, which currently has no default representation, but provides options to let the caller decide.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most behavior changes, there is a struct tag option or caller-specified option that can configure the behavior to operate under &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; semantics,
or even other caller-determined behavior.
See “Migrating to v2” for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Performance optimizations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Marshal&lt;/code&gt; performance of &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; is roughly at parity with &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;.
Sometimes it is slightly faster, but other times it is slightly slower.
The &lt;code&gt;Unmarshal&lt;/code&gt; performance of &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; is significantly faster than &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;,
with benchmarks demonstrating improvements of up to 10x.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to obtain greater performance gains, existing implementations of &lt;code&gt;Marshaler&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;Unmarshaler&lt;/code&gt; should
migrate to also implement
&lt;code&gt;MarshalerTo&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;UnmarshalerFrom&lt;/code&gt;,
so that they can benefit from processing JSON in a purely streaming manner.
For example, recursive parsing of OpenAPI specifications in &lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSON&lt;/code&gt; methods
significantly hurt performance in a particular service of Kubernetes
(see kubernetes/kube-openapi#315),
while switching to &lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSONFrom&lt;/code&gt; improved performance by orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information, see the &lt;code&gt;go-json-experiment/jsonbench&lt;/code&gt;
repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Retroactively improving &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to avoid two separate JSON implementations in the Go standard library, so it is critical that, under the hood, &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; is implemented in terms of &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several benefits to this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gradual migration: The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Marshal&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Unmarshal&lt;/code&gt;functions in&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;represent a set of default behaviors that operate according to&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;semantics. Options can be specified that configure&lt;code&gt;Marshal&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;Unmarshal&lt;/code&gt;to operate with entirely&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;, mostly&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;with a some&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;, a mix of&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;, mostly&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;with some&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;, or entirely&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;semantics. This allows for gradual migration between the default behaviors of the two versions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feature inheritance: As backward-compatible features are added to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;, they will inherently be made available in&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;. For example,&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;adds support for several new struct tag options such as&lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;and also support for the&lt;code&gt;MarshalJSONTo&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;UnmarshalJSONFrom&lt;/code&gt;interface methods, which are both more performant and flexible. When&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;is implemented in terms of&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;, it will inherit support for these features.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced maintenance: Maintenance of a widely used package demands significant effort. By having&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;use the same implementation, the maintenance burden is reduced. In general, a single change will fix bugs, improve performance, or add functionality to both versions. There is no need to backport a&lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt;change with an equivalent&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;change.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While select parts of &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; may be deprecated over time (supposing &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; graduates from being an experiment),
the package as a whole will never be deprecated.
Migrating to &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; will be encouraged, but not required.
The Go project will not drop support for &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experimenting with &lt;code&gt;jsonv2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The newer API in the &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/jsontext&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/v2&lt;/code&gt; packages are not visible by default.
To use them, build your code with &lt;code&gt;GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2&lt;/code&gt; set in your environment or with the &lt;code&gt;goexperiment.jsonv2&lt;/code&gt; build tag.
The nature of an experiment is that the API is unstable and may change in the future.
Though the API is unstable, the implementation is of a high quality and
has been successfully used in production by several major projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; is implemented in terms of &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; means that the underlying implementation of &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;
is completely different when building under the &lt;code&gt;jsonv2&lt;/code&gt; experiment.
Without changing any code, you should be able to run your tests
under &lt;code&gt;jsonv2&lt;/code&gt; and theoretically nothing new should fail:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go test ./...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The re-implementation of &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; in terms of &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; aims to provide identical behavior
within the bounds of the Go 1 compatibility promise,
though some differences might be observable such as the exact wording of error messages.
We encourage you to run your tests under &lt;code&gt;jsonv2&lt;/code&gt; and
report any regressions on the issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Becoming an experiment in Go 1.25 is a significant milestone on the road to formally adopting &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/jsontext&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;encoding/json/v2&lt;/code&gt; into the standard library.
However, the purpose of the &lt;code&gt;jsonv2&lt;/code&gt; experiment is to gain broader experience.
Your feedback will determine our next steps, and the outcome of this experiment,
which may result in anything from abandonment of the effort, to adoption as stable packages of Go 1.26.
Please share your experience on go.dev/issue/71497, and help determine the future of Go.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We include Bazel BUILD files for most components, but not a top-level BUILD or WORKSPACE file. We plan to add a more complete build and test system in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We invite the community to submit GitHub issues and pull requests for suggestions on improving the recommendation algorithm. We are working on tools to manage these suggestions and sync changes to our internal repository. Any security concerns or issues should be routed to our official bug bounty program through HackerOne. We hope to benefit from the collective intelligence and expertise of the global community in helping us identify issues and suggest improvements, ultimately leading to a better X.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here at Huntress, we love exposing adversary tradecraft, and we also love when threat actors make blunders. So imagine our delight when a threat actor installed Huntress onto their operating machine—after finding us via one of our advertising campaigns and starting a trial— giving us a sprawling inside look at how they’re using AI to build workflows, searching for tools like Evilginx, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all know that security products are often downloaded by attackers for “evaluation,” but often we can only guess as to how they decided to target a particular technology, or the actions taken while trying out such software. We recently had the pleasure of getting a front seat view into what one attacker did, simply because they installed our agent and let us collect information directly from them. Here, we will cover this strange tale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like most good stories, this one starts in the middle and works its way back and forth. Let’s start with how this person of interest got our attention. One of the tricks of the trade to get people interested in your products is through advertising. As such, we run ads to help lead potential customers to our products. An adverse effect here might be garnering some “unwanted” attention as well. Such is the setting for the beginning of this adventure: it all started with a nicely placed Google ad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The attacker tripped across our ad while researching another security solution. We confirmed this is how they found us by examining their Google Chrome browser history. An example of how this may have appeared to them in the moment may be seen in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It appears that the attacker became interested in Huntress while simultaneously trying out Bitdefender. After hitting our comparison page, they could hardly contain themselves and started a trial immediately. We are able to follow their journey through their Chrome history, as seen in Figure 2 below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that threat actors may install security products for research purposes or even for legitimate use—and in fact, the adversary was interested in other security products in addition to Bitdefender and Huntress. We found evidence that they had bought a Malwarebytes subscription (including the Malwarebytes browser guard extension).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We knew this was an adversary, rather than a legitimate user, based on several telling clues. The standout red flag was that the unique machine name used by the individual was the same as one that we had tracked in several incidents prior to them installing the agent. Further investigation revealed other clues, such as the threat actor’s browser history, which appeared to show them trying to actively target organizations, craft phishing messages, find and access running instances of Evilginx, and more. We also have our suspicions that the operating machine where Huntress was installed is being used as a jump box by multiple threat actors—but we don’t have solid evidence to draw firm conclusions at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huntress analysts went to work evaluating the outstanding indicators of compromise found on the adversary’s host and how they related to data found within authentications to identities at Huntress. Retroactive hunts disclosed a further 20 identities which were compromised; many of which had been accessed by the adversary prior to Huntress’ deployment against the identity, whose activity was limited to refreshing session tokens to maintain access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, analysis of the adversary’s primary operating infrastructure, hosted on Autonomous System (AS) “12651980 CANADA INC.” (now known as VIRTUO) disclosed a pattern of access of over 2471 unique identities spanning the last two weeks– many of which were preemptively caught by additional detection capabilities such as malicious mail rule creation, or session token theft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intelligence gathered by the above has resulted in detections of high confidence against the adversary’s infrastructure; and equipped our systems and analysts to respond to these incidents in significantly less time and with extreme confidence in malice, eliminating adversarial attempts to evade our detections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, we were able to see the threat actor’s specific day-to-day activities—from their methodologies to the specific types of organizations (and even individuals) they were interested in. We also saw them begin to tinker with tools and search for tutorials, attempting to learn more. For instance, after installing the Huntress agent, the threat actor took steps to better understand Autoruns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Figure 4: The threat actor attempting to better understand Autoruns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, over the course of three months we saw an evolution in terms of how the threat actor refined their processes, incorporated AI into their workflows, and targeted different organizations and vertical markets, as outlined in Figure 5 below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 5: An overview of some of the threat actor’s activities that we saw over the months&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are some of the specific methodologies that we saw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chrome browser history gave a first-hand look at how the adversary is using AI tools to increase the operational efficiency of their workflows. While there have previously been many reports on how cybercriminals are using AI (based on indicators in phishing messages or landing page content), this is the first time that we have a close-up view of a threat actor embedding AI into their operations in order to automate—and speed up—their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On May 25, the threat actor signed up for Make.com, which is legitimate workflow automation software, before researching the platform’s Telegram Bot integration feature as a way to launch automated processes (as seen in Figure 6 below). The threat actor then poked around several FAQ sites to better understand how Telegram Bot APIs work and how to set up webhooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, the threat actor started to get a better grasp of how they could use Make.com for specific workflows, and their browser history shows them starting to rely more heavily on the platform. By the time June 29 rolled around, the threat actor had fully developed their workflow with Make. As seen in Figure 8, the threat actor would first identify the organization of interest (typically after receiving a “tip” from Telegram) before using Google Translate to translate or craft messages related to these organizations. While we don’t have detailed insight into how the threat actor was using Make for these specific workflows, we can see that it was part of the process to automate specific functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 8: Threat actor starts to rely on automated workflows&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The threat actor also appeared to be interested in other AI tools to help with data generation and writing. We saw multiple Google searches for “free ai no signup” and for “csv generator ai.” We also saw the threat actor using Toolbaz AI, which is a writing assistant; the CSV spreadsheet generator feature of DocsBot AI, which is an AI chatbot tool; and the AI data generator feature of Explo AI, which is an embedded analytics tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We saw evidence of the threat actor searching for running instances of the Evilginx man-in-the-middle attack framework using Censys, and then attempting to access those instances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to Evilginx, we also found evidence of multiple installed tools on the threat actor’s system—or, in some cases, an interest in tools based on the threat actor browser history. These tools included recon and attack tool GraphSpy, open source tool Bloodhound, the TeamFiltration framework used for enumeration and exfiltration, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chrome browser history also revealed visits by the threat actor to multiple residential proxy webpages, including LunaProxy and Nstbrowser (which bills itself as an anti-detect browser and supports the use of residential proxies). The threat actor visited the pricing plan page for LunaProxy, researched specific products, and looked up quick start guides throughout May, June, and July. Residential proxy services have become increasingly popular with threat actors as a way to route their traffic through residential IP addresses, allowing them to obscure malicious activity, like avoiding suspicious login alerts while using compromised credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chrome browser history entries also gave us a close view of the attacker’s reconnaissance methods. The threat actor spent a lot of time researching companies across different sectors, from specific banks to “top real estate companies in the US” (also looking up “real estate agents in California”).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The threat actor didn’t just search for individual companies—they also looked at all parts of the ecosystem surrounding organizations of interest, from their customer bases to associated third-party companies across the supply chain. For example, the threat actor appeared to start targeting software companies in early July, searching for these types of companies via Google Search and using database marketing tools like ReadyContacts and InfoClutch to scope out how many customers they had and their market share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The threat actor also used the BuiltWith platform, which lets users identify and analyze the technology stacks used by websites. On July 8, browser entries show the attacker conducting an extensive level of research on a prominent ecommerce vendor for managing payments and subscriptions, including a list of its customers, contacts, and market share. The threat actor then used BuiltWith to search for the websites relying on that vendor, before navigating to the BuiltWith sign up page, presumably to access that list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The threat actor conducted a fair amount of research into tools used to scrape Telegram group data, including looking at scraper tools like Apify, the Axiom Chrome extension, and the RapidAPI platform (Figure 13).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The threat actor used Google Translate extensively, and Chrome browser shows them first visiting bank websites, and then using the translation platform, likely to assist in crafting phishing-related messages, as seen in Figure 14.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The attacker often used urlscan to get information about various websites. Tips appear to have come in via Telegram using the getUpdates method.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were several entries in the browser history that showed use of Google Translate to translate messages from Portuguese to English alongside browsing banks in Brazil, then evidence of crafting messages later on in their history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also saw the threat actor express interest in STYX Market, a dark web forum that’s been around since 2023, and was recently called a “rising star for stealer logs, stolen creds, and laundering services” by researchers. After doing some initial research on STYX—as well as other Telegram chat groups and channels—they decided to check out the site for themselves, registering for an account before perusing the catalog of VoIP accounts, stealer logs, SIM cards, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rarely do you ever get the chance to actually shoulder surf a real threat actor. We had such an opportunity when they installed our agent. It starts out mundane enough. We don’t know what they must have dreamed about after ending their shift at 2am UTC the previous night, but as mentioned earlier, you can see them start a trial, download the agent, and install it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most interesting activity for the start of their day on July 9, 2025 was browsing to urlscan.io to inspect login.incipientcroop[.]com. Shortly after, they logged into Make.com and began working on a project called Voltage_Office356bot (notice the typo).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is evidence that the threat actor had access to cookie data for two different individuals, and accessed them via Notepad++. They proceeded to open the first file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\Telegram &lt;lb/&gt;Desktop\Cookies_[victim1]@[redacted1][.].com.json&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then they started looking around to see what they can find, with a Google search for “email osint”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, they opened the second cookie file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\Telegram &lt;lb/&gt;Desktop\Cookies_[victim2]@[redacted2][.].com.json&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They then started up Nstbrowser.exe and LunaProxy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Program Files\Nstbrowser\Nstbrowser.exe&lt;lb/&gt;C:\Program Files (x86)\LunaProxy_cata\socks5\LunaProxyDivert.exe SOCK5 [snip]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They browsed to an article titled Say Hello to your new cache flow by Synacktiv covering WHFB and Entra ID, followed by a Google search for “whfb prt”, which landed them on the website of a well-known researcher, Dirk-Jan Mollema.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They checked their IP address after this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Windows\system32\curl.exe ipinfo[.]io&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then checked their IP address again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Windows\system32\curl.exe ipinfo[.]io&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They then tried to use a tool called ROADtools Token eXchange (roadtx):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\roadtx.exe prtauth -r msgraph -c msteams&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then erroneously tried to run the same tool (as an executable) via Python:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\roadtx.exe prtauth -r msgraph -c msteams&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then ran it again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\roadtx.exe describe&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then tried to run it again, erroneously, using Python:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\roadtx.exe describe&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They seemed to be having trouble. At this point they browsed to Dirk-jan Mollema’s post on Phishing for Microsoft Entra primary refresh tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While there, they gained some new inspiration, and discovered a handy little script that could make their life easier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point they went back to their Voltage_Office356bot project before running this new script they’ve downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They started trying to run the Python script:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe main.py -f roadtx.prt --wfb&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They checked the usage again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe main.py --wfb&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe main.py -h&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, they started to run it against the original victim whose cookie file we saw earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe main.py --wfb -u [victim2]@[redacted2][.]com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They returned to the first victim’s cookie file:&lt;lb/&gt;C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\Telegram &lt;lb/&gt;Desktop\Cookies_[victim1]@[redacted1][.].com.json&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where our EDR data drops off, as they may have become aware of us and uninstalled the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The attacker’s browser history gives us an unprecedented level of insight into their everyday activity, searches, workflows, research, and more. The browser history shows the threat actor working intensively almost every day between the period of May 29, 2025 through July 9, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On many of these days, the browser entries were seen across most hours of the day, logging 12 to 14 hours. But there was some variation, as seen in Figure 29, above: on several days, the threat actor worked as little as one to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we hone in on a few of the days when the most hours were put in, we can see some of the things that piqued the attacker’s interest in those days. We analyzed the urls to see what businesses, or categories they might have fallen into, and then looked to see how many times the attacker visited these sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see a few trends. During these days, the attacker spent a lot of time researching various banking entities and bank personnel. To further expand on some of the graph labels:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attack infra: Malicious websites or servers set up by an attacker (maybe not this one) hosting frameworks like Evilginx and other known tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banking: Various banking websites&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browser extension: Various browser extensions like ad blockers, etc. installed by the attacker to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corporate &amp;amp; Business: Various business websites not housed under a different category.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crypto: Various cryptocurrency and blockchain websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity: Various cybersecurity vendor websites. The attacker often signed up for trials at various vendors to test things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Government &amp;amp; military: Various official government or military websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News, media &amp;amp; information: Various news websites like CNN etc. The attacker often read articles related to various breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OSS: Open source projects, often housed at github or gitlab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recon: Activities where the attacker was using Censys, Urlscan, Google, etc., to do reconnaissance for a particular target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research: When the attacker was researching a particular vulnerability, tool, or attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sandbox: The attacker often seemed interested in various types of malware that were on VirusTotal, Joe’s Sandbox, and other online sandboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media: Various telegram, X, and other social media posts read by the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software: Various legitimate software, like 7zip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Telecommunications: A telecommunication website, like Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web &amp;amp; IT infrastructure: Various online hosting services, like Mega, Amazon AWS, and Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see that from May 29 to June 1, 2025, the attacker was mostly looking at various banking websites. Digging further into their activities, you see them researching various banks, reading about Telegram Bots, then downloading a blueprint from Make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next day, it seems that the attacker spent a little more time researching various attack infrastructure, in addition to focusing on banks, and similar activities seen previously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On May 31, 2025 and June 1, 2025, the attacker switched their focus back to mostly researching banking websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other interesting thing was that the attacker was mostly focused on banks and sites that were in Nigeria during this time period, even looking for things like:&lt;lb/&gt;“No. 1 regulated crypto exchange in Nigeria.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“top crypto companies nigeria”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Best Crypto Exchanges in Nigeria”&lt;lb/&gt;“Top Cryptocurrency Companies in Nigeria”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we don’t know where the attacker is based, the machine they had installed our agent upon appeared to be based in the United States, on the West Coast, based on the machine’s internal time zone and IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that the attacker had spent quite some time looking at our various capabilities after they had started a trial with us. Figure 36 above shows just how much more time they spent interacting with the Huntress website, and particularly the account dashboard once they had started the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This incident gave us in-depth information about the day-to-day activities of a threat actor, from the tools they were interested in to the ways they conducted research and approached different aspects of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon confirming that the machine name was one used by an adversary, we decided to release these details because they give an invaluable understanding into the mindset and behaviors of threat actors behind attacks. For other defenders, we hope that this information can help add context around the ways that threat actors conduct research and launch attacks at the backend—and the different types of organizations, tools, and platforms that interest them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get insider access to Huntress tradecraft, killer events, and the freshest blog updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
