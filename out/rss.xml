  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2023, Apple sunsetted (pun intended) the Dark Sky mobile app on iOS. Apple purchased the company behind the popular weather application in early 2020, then announced that it would be shutting down the Dark Sky applications (first on Android, then on iOS and web), and finally stated in 2022 that the forecast technology would be integrated into the Apple Weather app with iOS 16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dark Sky was much more than just an API or a set of “forecast technologies.” The design of the Dark Sky mobile application represented a hallmark of information design because the team clearly obsessed over how people would actually use the app on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a gallery of screenshots I personally took in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of Dark Sky was so wonderful that I could understand the shape of the weather at a glance, even from a zoomed out view of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Common use cases for a weather app&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we can dissect what makes the design of this app so special, let’s define the most common use cases for a weather app. A good weather app attempts to address a range of use cases in a person’s life. Here are some common use cases for a weather app, starting with the contextual goals first:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the questions I want to answer vary based on the context and situation I’m in. This is the perfect situation for software that embraces good information design principles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Magic Ink, Bret Victor defined information design “as the design of context-sensitive information graphics.” Unlike static graphics, like a weather map in a newspaper, information graphics in software can be highly dynamic and can incorporate context from the user’s environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark Sky aggressively leaned into these ideas, and the team worked hard to turn nearly everything in the application into a context-sensitive information graphic. Let’s dive deeper into some examples where this notion is in full display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weather forecast for the day at a precise location&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll start by listing my goals when trying to understand the upcoming weather for the day:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default experience for the Dark Sky application is to show weather for the next 12 hours at my precise location. Here are three screenshots from the app, from different days and locations. What do you notice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app contextualizes the information that’s presented based on what’s most relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the left-most screenshot, the context of the weather storm that’s passing by my location and some potential light rain is emphasized to the user. The wind advisory and dip in the “feels like” temperature also make honorable mentions. In combination with the clickable Wind Advisory warning, I can quickly understand that the storm has passed my specific location but I should still be mindful of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the middle screenshot, the storm front heading my direction, the imminent rain starting within the hour, and the hours of rain later in the day are emphasized front and center. Based on my interest in the rain, I scrolled down (not shown in screenshot) to switch from temperature to rain probability for the main weather view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the right-most screenshot, the temperature distribution throughout the day is emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of little details that are easy to miss, as well. For example, all three screenshots above start showing weather information starting at the current moment (“now”) and onwards. This is brilliant, because I only occasionally care about weather from a few hours or days ago. (To accommodate those situations, the app did have a unique Time Machine view to explore past weather data.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weather forecast for the week&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit our goals when trying to understand the weather for the week:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While many other weather apps focus on helping me understand the weather at the city level, the Dark Sky app differentiates itself by enabling me to understand the weather with a hyperlocal view. I can view the weather at specific addresses and landmarks and understand how the weather might be different in a city center compared to the towns around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, the Dark Sky app shows the weekly weather summary at my current location (screenshot on the left). I can contextualize the weekly weather view by clicking the search icon and typing in the alternative location I’m interested in (screenshot on the right).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a glance, I can quickly understand:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which days are likely to rain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which days have wide temperature ranges (low lows and high highs).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The general shape of the weather (micro-trends).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gallery of subtle design elements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first few sections, I laid the groundwork by diving a bit more deeply into specific aspects of Dark Sky. Now that I’ve hopefully engaged your critical design eye, I’d like to elevate other elements in the app’s design in a more rapid-fire fashion. I hope that this section will provide some ideas and inspiration for people designing their own data-rich applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preserving temperature magnitudes in ranges&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To represent data visually, the data needs to be mapped from “data space” to “pixel space”. In some domains and scenarios, you want to ensure the magnitudes are carried over, and in others you want to rescale the values to a fixed scale so the resulting charts are more consistent in the space and pixels they take up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Dark Sky app, the “temperature pills” representing the forecasted temperatures for the upcoming week preserve their existing magnitude more effectively in the visualization. The temperature values are more tightly integrated with the visual representation, making the combined experience more amenable to quick comparison across multiple days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many weather apps opt for the design pattern on the right, where all temperature ranges are rescaled to take up the same amount of space in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacing numbers with rough categories&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interpreting hourly distributions of rainfall or snowfall can be difficult. Is 0.25 inches of rain a lot over the next hour? What about 0.2 inches of snow per hour for the next hour, then 0.15 for the hour after that? How do I prepare for these circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help users stay informed and take action, the app will often replace precise forecast distributions of rainfall and snowfall with rough categories instead. This design choice has two positive effects on users:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It contextualizes the forecast to simpler categories that can help us quickly make changes in our life if needed. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Light snow that starts and stops means that my snow shoveling company won’t come out, but heavy snow means they likely will.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Heavy snow means I should probably make sure my outdoor furniture is better covered and ready to take the snow.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It removes a sense of artificial precision that doesn’t really exist because weather forecasts fundamentally have very high uncertainty and error bands.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contextualized storm map&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple color scales combined with arrows go a very long way to conveying relevant storm information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wind direction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of conveying wind direction using text (“NW” or “Northwest”), the app uses arrows! If the wind shifts directions throughout the day, I can feel the wind direction changing using my body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Complaints from former Dark Sky users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I could probably write an entire book about the design of Dark Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I want to share some passionate comments from other Dark Sky fans. While most of them aren’t data viz or design nerds, they feel that the Apple Weather app is not a sufficient replacement. These people relied on Dark Sky to make decisions and grew very attached to an application that integrated deeply into their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;0000GKP on Reddit: “I have already made the transition to the Weather app. The information is presented in a much less efficient manner than Dark Sky so it takes more effort to get it, but it is all there (except for cloud cover).”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TheGeckoDude on Reddit: “Is there anything that has the precipitation graph similar to dark sky? The biggest thing I will miss from dark sky is that graph. I’m outside a lot and it is super helpful for knowing when to take cover or when it might rain. I need to find a feature like that because the vague weather precipitation info will not cut it for me.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s make data shine!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark Sky started with publicly available data, augmented it with contextualized predictions, rigorously iterated on data visualization design, and packaged all of this into a contextualized experience to make weather data useful for me in my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the availability of data has never been higher, we’re still missing software experiences that contextualize that data to make our lives better. Data alone isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world needs more Dark Sky-like experiences to help us improve our spending habits, help us sleep better, and more. If you’re working on information software, I hope you can be inspired by the body of design and engineering work that Dark Sky pioneered.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI is a business model stress test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI commoditizes anything you can specify. It can't commoditize what you have to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind Labs laid off 75% of its engineering team last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adam Wathan, CEO of Tailwind Labs, spent the holidays running revenue forecasts. In a GitHub comment, he explained what happened:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business. Traffic to our docs is down about 40% from early 2023 despite Tailwind being more popular than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story circulating is that AI is killing Open Source businesses. I don't think that is quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI didn't kill Tailwind's business. It stress tested it. Their business model failed the test, but that is not an indictment of all Open Source business models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind's business model worked for years. It relied on developers visiting their documentation, discovering Tailwind Plus while browsing, and buying it. Tailwind Plus is a $299 collection of pre-built UI components. Traffic led to discovery, and discovery drove sales. It was a reasonable business model, but always fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last year, more and more developers started asking AI for code instead of reading documentation, and their sales and marketing funnel broke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a fairness issue here that I don't want to skip past. AI companies trained their models on Tailwind's documentation and everything the community wrote about it. And now those models generate Tailwind code and answer Tailwind questions without sending anyone to Tailwind's website. The value got extracted, but compensation isn't flowing back. That bothers me, and it deserves a broader policy conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I keep coming back to is this: AI commoditizes anything you can fully specify. Documentation, pre-built card components, a CSS library, Open Source plugins. Tailwind's commercial offering was built on "specifications". AI made those things trivial to generate. AI can ship a specification but it can't run a business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does value live now? In what requires showing up, not just specifying. Not what you can specify once, but what requires showing up again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Value is shifting to operations: deployment, testing, rollbacks, observability. You can't prompt 99.95% uptime on Black Friday. Neither can you prompt your way to keeping a site secure, updated, and running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why Vercel created Next.js and gives it away for free. The Open Source framework is the conduit; the hosting is the product. Same with Acquia, my own company. A big part of Acquia's business model is selling products around Drupal: hosting, search, CI/CD pipelines, digital asset management, and more. We don't sell describable things; we sell operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open Source was never the commercial product. It's the conduit to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked what to pivot to, Wathan was candid: "Still to this day, I don't know what we should be pivoting to". I've written about how digital agencies might evolve, but CSS frameworks and component libraries are a harder case. Some Open Source projects make for great features, but not great businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind CSS powers millions of sites. The framework will survive. Whether the company does is a different question. I'm rooting for them. The world needs more successful Open Source businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Removing friction sometimes creates chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations minimize coalitions needed to maintain control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ripe ideas emerge independently across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copying forms without understanding structure guarantees failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actions must be expensive to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gifts, moral debts, and technical debt share logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joy became more productive than efficiency optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting worse precedes getting better in skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large coordination emerges from small-scale trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standardization enables scale but destroys local knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Method of creation shapes what is created.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open systems consolidate into monopoly, then repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transforming vague concepts into testable frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building observability changes what you see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decision-making speed determines conflict outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplification enables breakthroughs or destroys value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing what others don't creates competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Precise measurement creates infrastructure for distant trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Container shipping remade global supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pursuit of perfection prevents completion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Import order constantly or dissolve into disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplified models systematically fail in complex reality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Finding and Fixing Ghostty's Largest Memory Leak&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, users started reporting that Ghostty was consuming absurd amounts of memory, with one user reporting 37 GB after 10 days of uptime. Today, I'm happy to say the fix has been found and merged. This post is an overview of what caused the leak, a look at some of Ghostty's internals, and some brief descriptions of how we tracked it down.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leak was present since at least Ghostty 1.0, but it is only recently that popular CLI applications (particularly Claude Code) started producing the correct conditions to trigger it at scale. The limited conditions that triggered the leak are what made it particularly tricky to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix is merged and is available in tip/nightly releases, and will be part of the tagged 1.3 release in March.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The PageList&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand the bug, we first need to understand how Ghostty manages terminal memory. Ghostty uses a data structure called the &lt;code&gt;PageList&lt;/code&gt;
to store terminal content. PageList is a doubly-linked list of
memory pages that store the terminal content (characters, styles, hyperlinks,
etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The underlying "pages" are not single virtual memory pages but they are a contiguous block of memory aligned to page boundaries and composed of an even multiple of system pages.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These pages are allocated using &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; isn't particularly fast,
so to avoid constant syscalls, we use a memory pool. When we need
a new page, we pull from the pool. When we're done with a page, we return
it to the pool for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pool uses a standard size for pages. Think of it like buying standard-sized shipping boxes: most things people ship fit in a standard box, and having a standard box comes with various efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But sometimes terminals need more memory than a standard page provides. If a set of lines has many emoji, styles, or hyperlinks, we need a larger page. In these cases, we allocate a non-standard page directly with &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, bypassing the pool entirely. This is typically a
rare scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we "free" a page, we apply some simple logic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the page is &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= standard size&lt;/code&gt;: return it to the pool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the page is &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; standard size&lt;/code&gt;: call&lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;to free it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the core background for terminal memory management in Ghostty, and the idea itself is sound. A logic bug around an optimization is what produced the leak, as we'll see next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Scrollback Optimization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's one more background detail we need to cover to understand the bug: scrollback pruning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ghostty has a &lt;code&gt;scrollback-limit&lt;/code&gt; configuration that caps how much history
is retained. When you hit this limit, we delete the oldest pages in
the scrollback buffer to free up memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this often happens in a super hot path (e.g. when outputting large amounts of data quickly), and allocating and freeing memory pages is expensive, even with the pool. Therefore, we have an optimization: reuse the oldest page as the newest page when we reach the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This optimization works great. It requires zero allocations and uses only some quick pointer manipulations to move the page from the front to the back of the list. We do some metadata cleanup to "clear" the page but otherwise leave the previous memory intact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fast and empirically speeds up scrollback-heavy workloads significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Bug&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the scrollback pruning optimization, we always resized our page back to standard size. But we didn't resize the underlying memory allocation itself, we only noted the resize in the metadata. The underlying memory was still the large non-standard &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; allocation, but now the PageList thought it was standard
sized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, we'd free the page under various circumstances (e.g. when the user closes the terminal, but also other times). At that point, we'd see the page memory was within the standard size, assume it was part of the pool, and we would never call &lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt; on it.
A classic leak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all seems pretty obvious, but the issue is that non-standard pages are rare by design. The goal of our design and optimizations is that standard pages are the common case and provide a fast-path. Only very specific scenarios produce non-standard pages and they're usually not produced in large quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the rise of Claude Code changed this. For some reason, Claude Code's CLI produces a lot of multi-codepoint grapheme outputs which force Ghostty to regularly use non-standard pages. Additionally, Claude Code uses the primary screen and produces a significant amount of scrollback output. These things combined together created the perfect storm to trigger the leak in huge quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to be explicit that this bug is not Claude Code's fault. Claude Code is simply exercising Ghostty in a way that exposes this long-standing bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Fix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix is conceptually simple: never reuse non-standard pages. If we encounter a non-standard page during scrollback pruning, we destroy it properly (calling &lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;) and allocate a fresh
standard-sized page from the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of the fix is in the snippet below, but some extra work was needed to fix up some other bits of accounting we have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (first.data.memory.len &amp;gt; std_size) {
    self.destroyNode(first);
    break :prune;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could've also reused the non-standard page and just retained the large memory size, but until we have data that shows otherwise, we're still operating under the assumption that standard pages are the common case and it makes sense to reset back to a standard pooled page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other users have recommended more complex strategies (e.g. maintaining some metrics on how often non-standard pages are used and adjusting our assumptions accordingly), but more research is needed before making those changes. This change is simple, fixes the bug, and aligns with our current assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Finding the Leak with VM Tags&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the fix, I added support for virtual memory tags on macOS provided by the Mach kernel. This lets us tag our PageList memory allocations with a specific identifier that shows up in various tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;inline fn pageAllocator() Allocator {
    // In tests we use our testing allocator so we can detect leaks.
    if (builtin.is_test) return std.testing.allocator;

    // On non-macOS we use our standard Zig page allocator.
    if (!builtin.target.os.tag.isDarwin()) return std.heap.page_allocator;

    // On macOS we want to tag our memory so we can assign it to our
    // core terminal usage.
    const mach = @import("../os/mach.zig");
    return mach.taggedPageAllocator(.application_specific_1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now when debugging memory on macOS, Ghostty's PageList memory shows up with a specific tag instead of being lumped in with everything else. This made it trivial to identify the leak, associate it with the PageList, and also verify that the fix worked by observing the tagged memory being properly freed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preventing Leaks in Ghostty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do a lot of work in the Ghostty project to find and prevent memory leaks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In debug builds and unit tests, we use leak-detecting Zig allocators.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CI runs &lt;code&gt;valgrind&lt;/code&gt;on our full unit test suite on every commit to find more than just leaks, such as undefined memory usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We regularly run the macOS GUI via macOS Instruments to look for leaks particularly in the Swift codebase.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We run every GTK-related PR using Valgrind (the full GUI) to look for leaks in the GTK codepath that isn't unit tested.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has worked really well to date, but unfortunately it didn't catch this particular leak because it only triggers under very specific conditions that our tests didn't reproduce. The merged PR includes a test that does reproduce the leak to prevent regressions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the largest known memory leak in Ghostty to date, and the only reported leak that has been confirmed by more than a single user. We'll continue to monitor and address memory reports as they come in, but remember that reproduction is the key to diagnosing and fixing memory leaks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big thanks to @grishy who finally got me a reliable reproduction so I could analyze the issue myself. Their own analysis reached the same conclusion as mine, and the reproduction let me verify both our understandings independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks also to everyone who reported this issue with detailed diagnostics. The community's analysis, especially around the &lt;code&gt;footprint&lt;/code&gt; output and
VM region counting, gave me important clues that pointed toward the PageList
as the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code is Clay&lt;/head&gt;January 10, 2026&lt;p&gt;Kerri and I took a ceramics class recently!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made a hypercube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My instructor was... disappointed. The class was supposed to make a mug, or a bowl, something functional. But I had this idea in my head and couldn't shake it. The glaze turned out amazing (this iridescent blue that shifts in the light). I've been wondering if it would look even cooler painted in Vantablack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I've been noticing parallels between code and clay. They're both mediums. Vessels for ideas. You weren't thinking about hypercubes until you saw one on the coffee table, and now you might be picturing what a ceramic tesseract would even look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are malleable. When you're centering the clay, it's constantly moving, constantly responding. You push a little too hard and the whole thing wobbles off center. Same with code. You add a feature, refactor something, introduce a bug, fix three more. It's never static. It's never done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clay breaks. A lot. My first few attempts collapsed on the wheel. One piece cracked in the kiln. I dropped another walking to my car. But nobody cries about it, you just start over. The clay doesn't care. It's just material waiting for the next idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're gonna have a really bad time if you get too attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code is the same way. We're so precious about it sometimes, like every line is sacred. But it's not. It's just text. Delete it. Rewrite it. Start fresh. The idea survives even when the implementation doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before AI, we had to make every plate and coffee mug by hand. Every line of code, carefully typed. Every function, crafted manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now? We've hit the industrial revolution of code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the industrial revolution came for pottery, factories started pumping out ceramics. Plates got cheap. Mugs became disposable. You'd think clay would have disappeared. Why bother with the slow, messy, manual process when machines could do it faster?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But clay didn't go away. Ceramics studios are everywhere now. People pay good money to throw pots on weekends. Kerri and I are proof. The craft got more valuable once it wasn't necessary anymore. When you don't have to make something by hand, choosing to makes it mean something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software engineers love to joke about automating themselves out of a job. Well, we're finally getting there. LLMs can write code. A lot of it, fast. The industrial revolution is here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happens to us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the same thing that happened to potters. The production work gets automated. The commodity code writes itself. But the craft remains. The weird ideas, the hypercubes, the things that don't fit in templates: that's still us. That's still human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly I think I'm going to like it more. I got into programming because I liked building things, not because I wanted to type boilerplate for the rest of my life. If AI handles the mugs, I can focus on the hypercubes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medium isn't going anywhere. It's just getting more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i never said it was good)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;TLDR:&lt;p&gt; Librario is a book metadata API that aggregates data from Google Books, ISBNDB, and Hardcover into a single response, solving the problem of no single source having complete book information. It's currently pre-alpha, AGPL-licensed, and available to try now[0].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have a personal library with around 1,800 books. I started working on a library management tool for us, but I quickly realized I needed a source of data for book information, and none of the solutions available provided all the data I needed. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and another might provide a good cover, but none provided everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I started working on Librario, a book metadata aggregation API written in Go. It fetches information about books from multiple sources (Google Books, ISBNDB, Hardcover. Working on Goodreads and Anna's Archive next.), merges everything, and saves it all to a PostgreSQL database for future lookups. The idea is that the database gets stronger over time as more books are queried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see an example response here[1], or try it yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;  curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer librario_ARbmrp1fjBpDywzhvrQcByA4sZ9pn7D5HEk0kmS34eqRcaujyt0enCZ' \
  'https://api.librario.dev/v1/book/9781328879943' | jq .
  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is pre-alpha and runs on a small VPS, so keep that in mind. I never hit the limits in the third-party services, so depending on how this post goes, I’ll or will not find out if the code handles that well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The merger is the heart of the service, and figuring out how to combine conflicting data from different sources was the hardest part. In the end I decided to use field-specific strategies which are quite naive, but work for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each extractor has a priority, and results are sorted by that priority before merging. But priority alone isn't enough, so different fields need different treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Titles use a scoring system. I penalize titles containing parentheses or brackets because sources sometimes shove subtitles into the main title field. Overly long titles (80+ chars) also get penalized since they often contain edition information or other metadata that belongs elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Covers collect all candidate URLs, then a separate fetcher downloads and scores them by dimensions and quality. The best one gets stored locally and served from the server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most other fields (publisher, language, page count), I just take the first non-empty value by priority. Simple, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently added a caching layer[2] which sped things up nicely. I considered migrating from net/http to fiber at some point[3], but decided against it. Going outside the standard library felt wrong, and the migration didn't provide much in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database layer is being rewritten before v1.0[4]. I'll be honest: the original schema was written by AI, and while I tried to guide it in the right direction with SQLC[5] and good documentation, database design isn't my strong suit and I couldn't confidently vouch for the code. Rather than ship something I don't fully understand, I hired the developers from SourceHut[6] to rewrite it properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've got a 5-month-old and we're still adjusting to their schedule, so development is slow. I've mentioned this project in a few HN threads before[7], so I’m pretty happy to finally have something people can try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code is AGPL and on SourceHut[8].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback and patches[9] are very welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[0]: https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1]: https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/a6c3b1130133f384cffd25b3...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2]: https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[3]: https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[4]: https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[5]: https://sqlc.dev&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[6]: https://sourcehut.org/consultancy/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[7]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45419234&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[8]: https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[9]: https://git.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/tree/trunk/item/CONTRI...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fast, lightweight text editor for Markdown, JSON, YAML, and TOML files. Built with Rust and egui for a native, responsive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;Platform Note: Ferrite has been primarily developed and tested on Windows. While it should work on Linux and macOS, these platforms have not been extensively tested. If you encounter issues, please report them.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Raw Editor&lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Split View&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Auto-Save - Configurable auto-save with temp-file safety&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Multi-agent orchestration system for Claude Code&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Sisyphus, these agents persist until every task is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install • Usage • Agents • Architecture • Website&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Day 0: oh-my-opencode was born. A multi-agent orchestration system. Beautiful. Powerful. Perhaps too powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Day ???: THE BANNING. They pulled the plug. They thought it was over.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Day ??? + 1: RESURRECTION. From the ashes rose oh-my-claude-sisyphus. Eleven agents. One mission.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today: The boulder rolls. The agents orchestrate. The chaos continues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Port of oh-my-opencode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claude-sisyphus/main/scripts/install.sh | bash&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install -g oh-my-claude-sisyphus&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Windows Users: This is the only supported installation method. Requires Node.js 18+.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claude-sisyphus.git
cd oh-my-claude-sisyphus
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The installer adds to your Claude Code config (&lt;code&gt;~/.claude/&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Check for and install updates&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# In Claude Code:

# Activate Sisyphus for a task
/sisyphus refactor the authentication module

# Set as default mode (persistent)
/sisyphus-default

# Use ultrawork for maximum performance
/ultrawork implement user dashboard with charts

# Deep search
/deepsearch API endpoints that handle user data

# Deep analysis
/analyze performance bottleneck in the database layer&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just include these words anywhere in your prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Activates parallel agent orchestration&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;search&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;locate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Deep analysis mode&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# These work in normal prompts too:
&amp;gt; ultrawork implement user authentication with OAuth

&amp;gt; find all files that import the utils module

&amp;gt; analyze why the tests are failing&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh-my-claude-sisyphus includes a silent auto-update system that checks for updates in the background. Updates are applied automatically without interrupting your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To manually check for updates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/update&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh-my-claude-sisyphus includes 18 lifecycle hooks that enhance Claude Code's behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Hook&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Enforces orchestrator behavior and delegation&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Magic keyword detection (ultrawork, search, analyze)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;ralph-loop&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Ensures todo list completion&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Background task completion notifications&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six builtin skills provide specialized capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Skill&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ultrawork&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Maximum performance with parallel agents&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ralph-loop&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Self-referential development until completion&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;frontend-ui-ux&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Designer-turned-developer UI/UX expertise&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Git expert for atomic commits and history&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are automatically activated via slash commands or magic keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;New in v1.8.0: Skills are no longer mutually exclusive. Claude automatically combines skills based on task requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills work in three composable layers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Layer&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Skills&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Purpose&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Execution&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;sisyphus, orchestrator, prometheus&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;HOW you work (pick primary)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Enhancement&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ultrawork, git-master, frontend-ui-ux&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ADD capabilities (stack multiple)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Guarantee&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ralph-loop&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ENSURE completion&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combination Formula: &lt;code&gt;[Execution] + [0-N Enhancements] + [Optional Guarantee]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude uses judgment to detect task type and activate appropriate skill combinations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Task Type&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sisyphus + ralph-loop&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;User emphasizes completion&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Components, styling&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complex debugging&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;oracle&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;sisyphus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Root cause → fix&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;Use the oracle agent to debug the memory leak in the worker process

Have the librarian find all documentation about the API

Ask explore to find all TypeScript files that import React

    &lt;p&gt;This is a port of oh-my-opencode adapted for Claude Code and the Claude Agent SDK. Here's what's different:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original oh-my-opencode used multiple AI providers. This port uses Claude models exclusively:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Agent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Original Model&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Ported Model&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Notes&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Was OpenAI's flagship for deep reasoning&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Claude-only? The Claude Agent SDK is designed for Claude models. Using Claude throughout provides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consistent behavior and capabilities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simpler authentication (single API key)&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Get details of a code action&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;lsp_servers&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Implemented&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;List available language servers&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: LSP tools require language servers to be installed (typescript-language-server, pylsp, rust-analyzer, gopls, etc.). Use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lsp_servers&lt;/code&gt;to check installation status.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Tool&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Pattern-based code search using AST matching&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ast_grep_replace&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Implemented&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Pattern-based code transformation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: AST tools use @ast-grep/napi for structural code matching. Supports meta-variables like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$VAR&lt;/code&gt;(single node) and&lt;code&gt;$$$&lt;/code&gt;(multiple nodes).&lt;/quote&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Architectural Changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plugin → Native Integration: Original was an OpenCode plugin; this uses Claude Code's native agent/command system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Provider → Single Provider: Simplified to Claude-only for consistency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom Runtime → Claude Code Runtime: Leverages Claude Code's built-in capabilities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Programmatic Config → Markdown Files: Agents defined as &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;files in&lt;code&gt;~/.claude/agents/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simpler Setup: One curl command vs. multi-step plugin installation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native Integration: Works directly with Claude Code, no plugin layer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consistent Behavior: All agents use Claude, no cross-model quirks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easier Customization: Edit markdown files to customize agents&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Model Diversity: Can't use GPT-5.2 for Oracle's deep reasoning&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Advanced Hooks: Fewer lifecycle interception points (22 hooks → system prompt enforcement)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're coming from oh-my-opencode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Oracle Tasks: Claude Opus handles architecture/debugging well, but differently than GPT-5.2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LSP Workflows: All LSP tools are available! Use &lt;code&gt;lsp_servers&lt;/code&gt;to check which servers are installed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AST Searches: Use &lt;code&gt;ast_grep_search&lt;/code&gt;with pattern syntax (e.g.,&lt;code&gt;function $NAME($$$)&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Background Tasks: Claude Code's &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt;tool with&lt;code&gt;run_in_background&lt;/code&gt;works similarly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Planning: Use &lt;code&gt;/plan&lt;/code&gt;command to start a planning session with Prometheus&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Code installed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic API key (&lt;code&gt;ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt;environment variable)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows: Node.js 18+ (for npm installation)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS/Linux: Bash shell (default) or Node.js 18+ (optional)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Bash (.sh)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced: Set&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SISYPHUS_USE_NODE_HOOKS=1&lt;/code&gt;to use Node.js hooks on macOS/Linux.&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A year of work on the ALPM project&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024 the Sovereign Tech Fund (STF) started funding work on the ALPM project, which provides a Rust-based framework for Arch Linux Package Management. Refer to the project's FAQ and mission statement to learn more about the relation to the tooling currently in use on Arch Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The funding has now concluded, but over the time of 15 months allowed us to create various tools and integrations that we will highlight in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have worked on six milestones with focus on various aspects of the package management ecosystem, ranging from formalizing, parsing and writing of file formats, over cryptographic verification of distribution artifacts, to package file and system package management handling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Formal specifications for packaging data formats"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Basic OpenPGP verification of artifacts"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Rust library for handling of individual packages"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Python bindings for alpm-srcinfo"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Distribution-agnostic OpenPGP stack for the verification of distribution artifacts"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Rust library for system package management"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are considering ourselves as part of a larger free software ecosystem. We believe that it makes sense to create value not only for our own niche, but for the greater good. As such, we focused on finding generic solutions to the technological problems we are facing as a distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are incredibly grateful for the support from STF without which this type of extensive ground work would not have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ALPM stats 📊&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of work has been done over the time of the STF funding. Below are a few statistics about the work done on the ALPM project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Specifications 📝&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Already in July we reported on the state of the specifications on the devblog and how they enable a deeper, shared view onto our current package management stack in Arch Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of custom file formats are in use in our ecosystem. Understanding how to use them is key to maintaining existing and envisioning new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interested developers and package maintainers are encouraged to browse them by file formats or concepts. Meanwhile, the alpm(7) specification provides a good high-level entry-point to the entire topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We hope this empowers a much larger group of contributors to participate in discussions about the concepts behind Arch Linux's package management. Additionally, we want to enable interested developers to participate in hacking both on the ALPM project itself, as well as make it much easier to experiment with new applications that are built on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Foundational libraries 📚️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the ALPM project we chose a bottom-up, library first approach, in which libraries for basic tasks have been created iteratively in a workspace. As more libraries for specific use-cases emerge, it becomes possible to build more elaborate or special purpose tools with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We invite interested Rust developers to have a look at the dedicated API documentation to gain a better understanding and overview of the available libraries and their dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The central alpm-types library provides shared low-level types, which are used in some or all file formats used by the Arch Linux package management stack. These common types make it easy to build other, interoperable libraries on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In alpm-common, central traits and utility functionality are made available to other libraries in the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some consideration and research, we chose the winnow parser combinator library to create parsers for the various custom file formats. Shared functionality for parsers is made available in the alpm-parsers library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Package management systems usually revolve around central dependency resolver functionality. With alpm-solve we have created a new approach to this for Arch Linux, which is based on the generic resolvo library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compression is an integral part of the packaging workflow. It ensures that an alpm-package(7) or alpm-repo-db(7) file can be transferred over the network as fast as possible by reducing its size. With the alpm-compress library we have implemented extensible (de)compression for these files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To allow extraction of metadata and data files from an alpm-package(7) file, as well as (rudimentary) package creation, we have created the alpm-package crate. With it, it is possible to create package files from prepared input directories (which already contain relevant metadata and data files). In addition, it is possible to effortlessly iterate over the data files contained in a package file and to extract validated metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The creation process of an alpm-package(7) file requires to add root-owned files to a directory (e.g. as part of the installation process of an upstream project's build system). However, one does not want to run the package build process as root, but as an unprivileged user. For this purpose we have created the rootless-run library, which generically abstracts running commands "as root" with the help of different backends (e.g. &lt;code&gt;fakeroot(1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rootlesskit&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Libraries and command line interfaces 💻️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on specifications of file formats currently used in Arch Linux, we have created libraries that allow their parsing, validation and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, we distinguish between:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File formats used in an alpm-source-repo(7) (i.e. SRCINFO(5), PKGBUILD(5)),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;those in an alpm-repo-db(7) (i.e. alpm-repo-desc(5) and alpm-repo-files(5)),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;those in an alpm-db(7) (i.e. ALPM-MTREE(5), alpm-db-desc(5) and alpm-db-files(5)) and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;those in an alpm-package(7) (i.e. ALPM-MTREE(5), BUILDINFO(5) and PKGINFO(5)).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alpm-srcinfo crate provides a library and command line interface for the parsing, validation and creation of SRCINFO(5) files from PKGBUILD(5) scripts. Due to the dynamic nature of the PKGBUILD(5) scripts, the SRCINFO(5) format is surprisingly complex (both to create and to evaluate). The creation of SRCINFO(5) files from PKGBUILD(5) scripts is enabled via the alpm-pkgbuild-bridge project, the alpm-pkgbuild crate and a translation layer in alpm-srcinfo. We have created dedicated documentation for the aspects of parsing and providing its data from different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alpm-buildinfo crate provides a library and command line interface for the parsing, validation and creation of BUILDINFO(5) files. This file format is contained in an alpm-package(7) and describes its build environment. In the context of reproducible builds it is used to recreate the build environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alpm-mtree crate provides a library and command line interface that allows parsing, validation and creation of ALPM-MTREE(5) files. This file format is a subset of the mtree(5) file format, provided by libarchive. As it can be considered more of a meta language than a data format, we rely on &lt;code&gt;bsdtar(1)&lt;/code&gt; to write that file format.
An ALPM-MTREE(5) file is contained in an alpm-package(7), as well as an entry of an alpm-db(7) and represents a record of all files contained in the package during package creation time.
After installing a package to a system, this file can be used to verify ownership and mode of files installed by the package and detect any missing files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alpm-pkginfo crate offers a library and command line interface for the parsing, validation and creation of PKGINFO(5) files. This file format is contained in an alpm-package(7) and describes all relevant metadata of a package (e.g. alpm-package-relation(7), alpm-package-name(7), alpm-package-version(7)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each system based on alpm(7) maintains its state using an alpm-db(7). This state encompasses information on each package:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the contained files (see alpm-db-files(5))&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;general metadata (see alpm-db-desc(5))&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a record that can be used to validate files of a package (see ALPM-MTREE(5))&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the alpm-db crate, it is possible to parse, validate and create the alpm-db-desc(5) and alpm-db-files(5) file formats. Additionally, we have worked on database access for the alpm-db(7) structure following the ACID characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Packages for compiled languages (e.g. C or C++) usually contain files in the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF). These files may expose soname information which may be used as alpm-package-relation(7) (see alpm-sonamev1(7) and alpm-sonamev2(7) for the two currently understood formats). With the alpm-soname crate we have focused on the handling and extraction of information for the more modern alpm-sonamev2(7) format as well as plain soname information. As a library and CLI, this crate offers easy access to this ELF data, which plays an important role in figuring out the run-time dependencies of packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each alpm-repo(7) contains a set of alpm-package(7) files, digital signatures and a package repository database (see alpm-repo-db(7)). An alpm-repo-db(7) tracks information on particular, unique packages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the contained files (see alpm-repo-files(5))&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;general metadata (see alpm-repo-desc(5))&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the alpm-repo-db crate, it is possible to parse, validate and write alpm-repo-desc(5) and alpm-repo-files(5) files. This crate provides both a library and CLI tool. In the future, it will be extended to allow the creation, reading and writing of alpm-repo-db(7) files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Development integration 👷&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test integration of our libraries against real world data, we have created the dev-scripts crate. It lives in the context of the ALPM project, and is intended as development testbed for assumptions of the various libraries. As such, the crate does not get any releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test integration makes it easy to download and prepare live data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;package source repositories (official and all of the AUR)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;official binary package repositories&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, it is possible to verify&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SRCINFO(5) files in package source repositories of the official repositories and all of the AUR&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ALPM-MTREE(5), BUILDINFO(5) and PKGINFO(5) files in binary packages in the official repositories&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the OpenPGP signatures of all packages in the official repositories&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;alpm-db-desc(5) and alpm-db-files(5) files in the entries of a local alpm-db&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;alpm-repo-desc(5) and alpm-repo-files(5) files in the entries of the alpm-repo-db(7) files of the official repositories&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Python bindings 🐍&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make our modern Rust-based parsers and verified types available for use from in other languages used by the distribution, we provide Python bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arch Linux's largest Python-based project, with arguably also the largest user-base, is the AURweb, which powers the Arch User Repository (AUR). The web application deals with user input, e.g. via SRCINFO(5) files and currently relies on the native Python library python-srcinfo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(As a sidenote: If you are a Python developer and interested in helping maintain a FastAPI based web application, please reach out to the project! We are always looking for further contributors and maintainers!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Python bindings for the ALPM project are available on PyPI as python-alpm. With them, we have focused on providing SRCINFO(5) support by relying on the alpm-srcinfo library and by proxy expose a lot of types from the alpm-types library as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The integration of the python-alpm library into the AURweb application is currently prepared (see aurweb!876).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are a Python developer and have specific needs for the integration of other libraries of the ALPM project, we would love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linting 🧶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linters are tools that shift some tedious responsibilities (e.g. quality control) from humans to automation. They are used to automatically detect common mistakes and deviations from established best practices. The goal of linting is to support humans in performing a task well, keeping them on a level with changes in best practices, and empowering them to produce better quality results with less manual effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usability and robustness of a distribution like Arch Linux currently relies heavily on the diligence of its package maintainers. Only if package maintainers make an effort to stay up to date with recent developments in packaging (e.g. best practices for languages or PKGBUILD(5) scripts) can the resulting package files maintain a high quality standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relying on the written specifications, foundational libraries, as well as libraries and command line interfaces we decided to create a framework for lints, that centrally exposes its knowledge database and allows to flexibly create new rules for various purposes. As such, another central goal of this framework is to provide a single, central tool that covers all aspects of Arch Linux package management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the alpm-lint crate, a central library and command line interface has been created, that thoroughly documents its architecture and how to add new lint rules. A custom, central website provides details about all currently existing lints, derived from the code documentation of the lint rules: https://alpm.archlinux.page/lints/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;alpm-lint(1)&lt;/code&gt; CLI, package maintainers are enabled to validate various scopes relevant to packaging (e.g. contents of an alpm-source-repo(7) or an alpm-package(7) file).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crate currently only offers a small set of lints and we encourage interested package maintainers with a background in Rust to write further lints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Translations 🌐&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are targeting the English language as first language for the project, but many people that are exposed to its error handling and command line interfaces are not native English speakers, or do not speak the language at all. While writing libraries and command line interfaces for various purposes in the context of the ALPM project we realized that we needed to improve the translation (aka. internationalization or i18n) story of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some research on current technologies used for software translation, we have settled on the fluent framework and created a convenient integration for our purposes with the custom fluent-i18n crate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interested users can now start translating the project on weblate, following our dedicated contributing guidelines on localizations and translations: https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/alpm/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;VOA 🔏&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arch Linux uses OpenPGP for the verification of its packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current OpenPGP integration hinges on a central GnuPG-based keyring. This solution suffers from several shortcomings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The keyring is context-independent. It is not possible to represent different verification contexts with it, e.g. package repository metadata that is signed with a different set of keys than those used for signing packages, or packages in unofficial repositories are signed by a different set of keys than those used for the official repositories.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The keyring and its behavior is specific to the GnuPG tool, and in part unspecified. The setup cannot be reliably used with other OpenPGP implementations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The keyring is stateful, and while its contents are populated by data from the package for archlinux-keyring, the entire mechanism requires a root-run agent service.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The GnuPG upstream has denounced the IETF-driven OpenPGP standardization process and has subsequently been removed from other major package management software such as &lt;code&gt;apt(8)&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;rpm(8)&lt;/code&gt;over the last three years. Compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations is no longer guaranteed (see e.g. the ArchWiki article on GnuPG for details)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Already before 2024, the idea emerged to verify digital signatures not with a stateful keyring mechanism, but to instead use a stateless directory structure containing verifiers (see keyringctl#3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This idea was discussed with a set of cross-distribution developers during Image-based Linux Summit 2024 and extended from the initial idea of a lookup directory only for OpenPGP to a more general, technology-agnostic mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, we set out to create a directory structure containing e.g. OpenPGP certificates, SSH pubkeys or X.509 certificates, which clearly describes in what context such verifiers are used when verifying artifacts of a distribution. A more in-depth discussion and rundown of the topic can be found in the talk "Verification of OS artifacts without stateful keyrings" from All Systems Go! 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;UAPI specification ✍️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2024 we started work on a specification to describe this new, technology-agnostic signature verification mechanism and to collect input from relevant stakeholders in several of the more complex technologies that we wanted to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial version of the specification "File Hierarchy for the Verification of OS Artifacts (VOA)" has been made available in June 2025 and covers the integration of OpenPGP as a first technology backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further technology backend specifications are available as drafts, but need more work to iron out open questions. If you have expertise with the use of SSH, X.509, minisign or signify for the signing of artifacts and have an interest in working on a Rust codebase, please reach out and help stabilize these additional backends!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;VOA reference implementation ⌨️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In July 2025 we started work on the VOA project, as a reference implementation of the UAPI specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Central handling of the VOA hierarchy is implemented in the technology-independent voa-core library. It serves as an abstraction to access verifiers from the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of OpenPGP-specific verifiers has been implemented in the voa-openpgp library. It handles artifact verification based on several different methods:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"plain": Artifacts are verified directly with artifact verifiers, without additional trust anchors. Artifact verifiers can be filtered using OpenPGP fingerprints or domain name matches for OpenPGP User IDs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;simple "trust anchor": Artifacts are verified using artifact verifiers, which in turn must be certified by trust anchors. Artifact verifiers can be filtered using domain name matches for OpenPGP User IDs and trust anchors can be filtered using OpenPGP fingerprints. Additionally, the number of required individual certifications for User IDs on each artifact verifier can be specified.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Web of Trust": Artifacts are verified using artifact verifiers, which must reach a sufficient level of trust according to an OpenPGP "Web of Trust" implementation. Artifact verifiers can be filtered using domain name matches for OpenPGP User IDs and trust anchors can be filtered using OpenPGP fingerprints. Additionally, the target trust amount, the trust amount of trusted introducers and the trust amount of filtered trust anchors can be set to a custom value.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orthogonal to the trust models outlined above, it is possible to specify the required number of independent and valid OpenPGP data signatures per artifact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Arch Linux we are currently using the Web of Trust implementation that GnuPG offers, on the basis of a GnuPG-specific keyring. However, for all intents and purposes, we are not making use of the features that the full "Web of Trust" model provides. Apart from basic temporal OpenPGP semantics and cryptographic validity, the following rules apply in archlinux-keyring:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is a set of three or more certificates that serve as trust anchors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is a set of packager certificates that each must have an OpenPGP User ID with an email that uses the "archlinux.org" domain and has three or more third-party certifications from trust anchors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in practice, Arch Linux relies on a "Web of Trust" with exactly one level of indirection, and manually curated sets of trust anchors and artifact verifiers. With voa-openpgp, Arch's verification requirements are best modeled with the simple “trust anchor” model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an additional feature, we have implemented the import of OpenPGP certificates as verifiers into VOA hierarchies from different sources. The import supports OpenPGP certificates split into OpenPGP packets and the custom directory structure used by archlinux-keyring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the voa-config library we have added support for a central configuration file format with which settings for VOA technology backends can be supplied. The file format (see voa(5)) allows flexible overrides that specify custom rules for any type of context in an OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following configuration describes the current policy for the Arch Linux distribution (see arch.yaml):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;default_technology_settings:

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;VOA high-level API and CLI 🖥️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the voa crate we provide a high-level API for consumers of VOA and a command line interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;voa(1)&lt;/code&gt;, it is possible to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inspect technology backend configuration settings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Import OpenPGP certificates as VOA verifiers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;List all VOA verifiers (by OS or specific context).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify a file using a detached OpenPGP signature and suitable VOA verifiers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All subcommands support JSON output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following example illustrates the semantics of the default VOA technology backend settings for Arch Linux as shown in the previous section:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ voa config show arch
OpenPGP settings

🔏 Each artifact requires 1 valid data signature(s) from artifact verifiers to be successfully verified.

✅ Each artifact is verified using the "trust anchor" verification method.

📧 A valid certificate must have a valid User ID that uses one of the following domains and has 3 certification(s) from individual trust anchors on it for the certificate to be considered as artifact verifier:
⤷ archlinux.org

🐾 A valid certificate must match one of the following OpenPGP fingerprints to be considered as trust anchor:
⤷ 2ac0a42efb0b5cbc7a0402ed4dc95b6d7be9892e

📝 The following sources have been considered for the creation of the settings:
⤷ Config file: /usr/share/voa/arch.yaml
⤷ Built-in defaults
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After installing the voa-verifiers-arch package, which provides the VOA verifiers used by Arch Linux, it is possible to verify Arch Linux artifacts (e.g. package files) using &lt;code&gt;voa(1)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ voa verify arch package default openpgp /var/cache/pacman/pkg/shadow-4.18.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst{,.sig}
✅ /var/cache/pacman/pkg/shadow-4.18.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst.sig 1751009927 991f6e3f0765cf6295888586139b09da5bf0d338 62cc73f884e52957b2fdd8839b7a287d9a2ec608
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Web of Trust and the Berblom algorithm 🕸️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The generalized "Web of Trust" model remains an interesting option in the OpenPGP domain. The "Web of Trust" enables more complex and more nuanced setups than the basic "trust anchor" mode. It also allows for fully decentralized management of trust, without relying on any single authority.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of 2024 and 2025, research has gone into comparing different "Web of Trust" implementations (see wot-observatory). The existing (legacy) implementations have surprising limitations and/or defects when it comes to the calculation of trust. This research led us to the conclusion that instead of relying on existing implementations and designs, a new approach was warranted to overcome the limitations of existing "Web of Trust" subsystems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our design is highly modular and centers around a pathfinding algorithm named "Berblom". Berblom is a novel and well-documented approach, which serves as a robust, general and efficient way of calculating the trust amount for an artifact verifier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are excited to integrate Berblom into the VOA reference implementation in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future work 🚀&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the ALPM project succeeded in the goals it set for itself in the funding period with Sovereign Tech Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While a lot of foundational documentation and central libraries have been written, there is still more work ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More lints 🧶🧶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new lint framework provided by alpm-lint currently only features few lints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going forward, we want to extend this list in the dedicated "Lints" milestone and encourage anyone with Rust experience and an interest in packaging to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to implementing lint rules, we want to explore the inclusion of the &lt;code&gt;alpm-lint(1)&lt;/code&gt; CLI in the canonical package build tooling for Arch Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;C-API 🇨&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our original project plan included potentially emulating the libalpm C-API in the scope of the contracting work. However, during the last months we realized, that for many consumers it would be more useful to rely on the finer grained libraries of the ALPM project directly instead. In addition, not all relevant database handling features are fully implemented yet, which would limit the usefulness of a C wrapper library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the medium term, it is certainly possible for interested developers to create an emulation of the libalpm C library based on ALPM. Reach out in case you are interested in something like this!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Repository database handling 📦️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the alpm-repo-db crate we have added support for the data files in use in an alpm-repo-db(7).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going forward, we want to add full handling of the database format: Creation, reading and compression of alpm-repo-db(7) files and the addition, update and removal of entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Add libkrun support to rootless-run 🏃➡️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code&gt;fakeroot(1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rootlesskit&lt;/code&gt; have their place in certain contexts, but they each also have their weaknesses (e.g. &lt;code&gt;fakeroot(1)&lt;/code&gt; does not provide isolation, &lt;code&gt;rootlesskit&lt;/code&gt; does not work in a containerized context).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going forward, we want to explore adding libkrun support to rootless-run to accommodate stronger isolation on the basis of KVM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Downloading of artifacts ⏬️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alpm-package and alpm-repo-db crates provide integration for handling local package and repository database files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a package management workflow these are usually downloaded from an alpm-repo(7). We want to provide support for securely downloading these artifacts over the network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Verification of artifacts 🔏&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VOA provides a distribution- and technology-agnostic specification for artifact verification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the voa project reference implementation, we want to add OpenPGP based verification for alpm-package(7) and alpm-repo-db(7) files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More VOA technology backends 🔐&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the technology backend for OpenPGP in place, we have ironed out the generic handling of verifiers in the voa reference implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interested parties have already worked on a proof of concept for an x.509 technology backend and provided a ticket for the inclusion of signify as technology backend (see voa#24).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in helping with the specification and implementation of more technology backends, please reach out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Extend Python bindings 🐍🐍&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are very happy with the current feature set of python-alpm. Going forward, we want to extend the API for the Python bindings further to cover even more use-cases of interested projects, such as archinstall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you enjoy hacking on the intersection of Rust and Python, feel free to reach out! We would be excited to collaborate with any interested contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More applications ⌨️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new set of ALPM project libraries enables building robust tools. Users of the libraries can rely on a strongly typed, memory safe language 🦀&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This empowers developers to build new special purpose package management applications with much greater ease. We look forward to building such applications ourselves, as well as seeing other parties building them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, user-facing improvements are our goal, and we think the foundation that we laid over the past year is fertile ground for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;demo-trimmed.mp4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lightweight 2D video seek grid library for video streaming sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate videos visually with a thumbnail grid instead of a 1D seek bar. Client-side frame extraction with smooth marker animation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;🎯 Stop blind scrubbing. See every scene at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Traditional Seek Bar&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;VAM Seek&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1D timeline, trial-and-error&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2D grid, instant visual navigation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Server-generated thumbnails&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Client-side canvas extraction&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Heavy infrastructure&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zero server load, ~15KB JS&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complex integration&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;One-line setup&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- 1. Add the script --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/unhaya/vam-seek/dist/vam-seek.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- 2. Connect to your video --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
  VAMSeek.init({
    video: document.getElementById('myVideo'),
    container: document.getElementById('seekGrid'),
    columns: 5,
    secondsPerCell: 15
  });
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it. See docs/INTEGRATION.md for full documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Client-side frame extraction - No server CPU usage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LRU cache - 200 frames cached in memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smooth marker animation - 60fps with requestAnimationFrame&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VAM algorithm - Precise timestamp calculation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Framework support - React, Vue, vanilla JS examples included&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your video never leaves the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional thumbnail systems upload videos to a server, process with FFmpeg, store thumbnails, and serve via CDN. This costs money, takes time, and raises privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VAM Seek works differently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Traditional&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;VAM Seek&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Video uploaded to server&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Video stays in browser&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Server-side FFmpeg processing&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Client-side Canvas API&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Thumbnails stored on disk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Frames cached in memory&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CDN bandwidth costs&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zero server cost&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Privacy risk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fully private&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All frame extraction happens in the user's browser using the Canvas API. When the page closes, everything is gone. No data is ever sent to any server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long videos are no longer watched from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We search. We go back. We verify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UI for this just didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;80-90%: Passive watching (1D seek bar is perfect)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10-20%: "Where was that scene?" / "I want to see that again" / "Skip this part"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1D seek bar excels at passive viewing. But for active exploration, it fails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Principle&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Implementation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Don't replace, supplement&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1D stays for normal use, 2D appears when needed&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zero learning curve&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;One click to show, click thumbnail to jump&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zero cognitive load&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"Let me check" → Already visible&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Disappears when not needed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Closes naturally, no mode switching&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1D seek bar is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lightweight&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Universally understood&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized for touch/mouse&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perfect for passive viewing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2D doesn't replace 1D. It handles what 1D cannot: exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good UI has these properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Doesn't break existing workflows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Appears only when needed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Understood instantly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Missed when removed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VAM Seek satisfies all four. Once you use it, going back feels incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: This UI is based on a design concept I call "Grid Seek Marker" — a time-exploration interface where video becomes a 2D navigable space. VAM Seek is the implementation; Grid Seek Marker is the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ripple is a compiler-first TypeScript UI framework for building fast, clean, reactive applications with minimal boilerplate and optimal performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why the Frontend World Needs Ripple in 2026&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Front-end development has reached an unusual point in its history:&lt;lb/&gt; writing code is easy — maintaining it is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI accelerated code output, but did not solve code quality, consistency, or review overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional frameworks are powerful but often come with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;verbose state handling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;over-rendering components&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;heavy abstraction layers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;confusing refs/signals/hooks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bloated bundle sizes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ripple was designed for this moment. It prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Code should read like it does.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is Ripple?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ripple is a compiler-first, fine-grained reactive UI framework with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TypeScript-first components&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; reactive variables with &lt;code&gt;track()&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no Virtual DOM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;automatic dependency tracking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;inline control flow&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;scoped CSS&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ripple’s Design Goals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Compiler Before Runtime&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler performs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DOM dependency analysis&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dead CSS removal&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;scoped styling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;code transformation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Reactive by Default&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let count = track(0);
&amp;lt;button onClick={() =&amp;gt; @count++}&amp;gt;{@count}&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ref()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.value&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$:&lt;/code&gt;, or signals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Low Cognitive Load&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less to memorize. Business logic remains obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Granular DOM Updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only updated nodes mutate — not whole components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initialize a new project:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npx create-ripple-app ripple-todo-app&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Move inside:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd ripple-todo-app&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If integrating manually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install ripple ripple-compiler ripple-dom&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Scripts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Folder Structure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;my-ripple-app/
├─ src/
│  ├─ App.ripple
│  ├─ index.tsx
│  └─ components/
├─ public/
├─ ripple.config.ts
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ package.json&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Verify Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;component App() {
  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{"Hello Ripple"}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it renders, you’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ripple in 2 Minutes: Core Syntax&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reactive Variables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let count = track(0);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Read + Write&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button onClick={() =&amp;gt; @count++}&amp;gt;{@count}&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reactive Collections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const todos = #[];
const user = #{ name: "Tom" };&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;component Greeting({ name }) {
  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{"Hello "}{name}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inline Control Flow&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for (const item of items) {
  &amp;lt;Item data={item}/&amp;gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Productivity Advantages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ripple reduces maintenance cost by:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;fewer primitives&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;direct reactivity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;compiler constraints&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;minimal boilerplate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;tiny runtime&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building a Real Demo: Todo List&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll demonstrate Ripple’s power with a fully reactive Todo List.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;TodoInput&lt;/code&gt; Component&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { track } from "ripple";

component TodoInput({ onAdd }) {
  let text = track("");

  function submit() {
    const v = @text.trim();
    if (v) {
      onAdd(v);
      @text = "";
    }
  }

  &amp;lt;div class="input"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input
      placeholder="Add a task..."
      value={@text}
      onInput={(e) =&amp;gt; @text = e.target.value}
      onKeyDown={(e) =&amp;gt; { if (e.key === "Enter") submit(); }}
    /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;button onClick={submit}&amp;gt;{"Add"}&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;TodoItem&lt;/code&gt; Component&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;component TodoItem({ todo, onToggle, onDelete }) {
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input type="checkbox" checked={todo.completed} onChange={onToggle} /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class={todo.completed ? "done" : ""}&amp;gt;{todo.text}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;button onClick={onDelete}&amp;gt;{"×"}&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; Component&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export component App() {
  const todos = #[];

  function add(text) {
    todos.push(#{ id: Date.now(), text, completed: false });
  }

  function toggle(t) {
    t.completed = !t.completed;
  }

  function remove(id) {
    const idx = todos.findIndex(t =&amp;gt; t.id === id);
    if (idx &amp;gt;= 0) todos.splice(idx, 1);
  }

  const remaining = () =&amp;gt; todos.filter(t =&amp;gt; !t.completed).length;

  &amp;lt;div class="app"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{"Todo List"}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;TodoInput onAdd={add} /&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
      for (const t of todos) {
        &amp;lt;TodoItem
          todo={t}
          onToggle={() =&amp;gt; toggle(t)}
          onDelete={() =&amp;gt; remove(t.id)}
        /&amp;gt;
      }
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{todos.length}{" total / "}{remaining()}{" remaining"}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;'The answer cannot be nothing': The battle over Canada's mystery brain disease&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five hundred people in a small Canadian province were diagnosed with a mystery brain disease. What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. "I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying," he recalled. "And an image of a cluster became more clear."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a "house of cards".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was "degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated," said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. "There's all these different levels."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called "original 48".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps," Lucas recalled. "We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. "He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important," Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was "the only one listening to them," said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He's an incredible human and physician," said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough," Nicholson said. "But he was such a pillar of support."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's like reading a movie script," emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We are all in the movie!", a senior federal scientist replied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the mystery disease got a name: the "New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it "one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We all owe you a debt of gratitude," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling "flabbergasted" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a "diarrhea of symptoms".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"All available evidence and logic" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was "not expected to pose risks" to human health or the environment.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. "I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full "boots-on-the-ground" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. "Everybody received that email like a cold shower," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking," Lanteigne said. "Full stop."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the government had decided against examining any of the patients in person, an omission that outraged those who believed they were part of the cluster. The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. "He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marrero declined to discuss it. "Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. "Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations," wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. "When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum," Lucas said. "And I choose him."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, "What now?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email," said Lucas. "He just has so many patients."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that," Strickland said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. "I think I waited four months for that letter," Strickland recalled. "I kept phoning and asking."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero "did nothing for April," Strickland said. "I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. "It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero," she recalled. "Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. "Those were the words he used," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms with a psychological root. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero. "As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND," Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. "And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me," she said. "I hit every single marker."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partridge is now on a multi-faceted FND treatment programme involving neurology, neuropsychology and occupational health. And she is at peace with her diagnosis. "The stigma is difficult," she said, "but I've accepted it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she "just needed to find a boyfriend", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet," stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. "He told her that she wasn't alone."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems," said her father Andre, angrily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The call pushed the Quigley-Cormier family away from Lang and his FND diagnosis and back towards Marrero, who the family had come to believe in deeply. Marrero had never crossed "any kind of line," Stacie said. "He's pristine."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"That's why all his patients like him," Andre said. "Love him, maybe."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people "co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"They are trying to present me as it," he said, dejectedly. "I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. "As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly," he said. "But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. "Lives hang in the balance," read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. "It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them," the letter said. "Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. "I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families," Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I would even go further," Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. "I would say they are being abused."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It has to be a patient complaint," they said. "And all his patients love him."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. "She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom," her stepmother said. "It's a very limited life."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero "deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people." But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. "The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jillian Lucas has now seen a second doctor, but only because she has pushed ahead with her decision to explore medical assistance in dying, which requires two physicians to sign off. Canada has among the world's most permissive laws for assisted dying, allowing people to pursue it without a terminal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Lucas told Marrero her plan, he became "choked up", she said. "It eats him up, he's fighting back tears."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, Marrero agreed to support her application, despite her not having a concrete diagnosis or testing positive for any known condition. (Marrero told the BBC he "took the utmost care to abide by" the laws around Maid and had "never proposed it" to a patient.) After all the years of uncertainty with the unknown neurological syndrome, the option of dying gave Lucas some sense of control. "I have a limit in my mind of how far I can go," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting in his garden office, the sun streaming in, Marrero had no such limits in mind. "I keep going because I know," he said, confidently. He had been able to meet "with some of the best scientists in the country," he said. He had more than 500 cluster patients now, and every week the number was going up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
