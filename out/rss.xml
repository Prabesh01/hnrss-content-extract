  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The staff ate it later&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The staff ate it later" (Japanese: この後、スタッフが美味しくいただきました, romanized: Kono ato, sutaffu ga oishiku itadakimashita) is a caption shown on screen when food appears in a Japanese TV program to indicate that it was not thrown away after filming (it is generally not socially acceptable to discard food in Japan). Some[who?] question the authenticity of this statement or believe the caption lowers the quality of TV programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First appearance&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;It is thought TV stations first began showing the caption to protect themselves against complaints from viewers who disliked food being handled without consideration in TV variety shows.[1] It is uncertain when this note was first used, but TV producer Kenji Suga stated viewers complained about the waste of food when a performance using small watermelons was broadcast in Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!! on Nippon TV. The TV station then showed this note on screen the following year in response.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Authenticity&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;There are various claims as to whether or not staff actually eat the food that appears in the programs.[1][3][4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Supporting reports&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;According to AOL News in 2014, the crew on one information program claimed: "It's sometimes impossible for the reporter to eat all the food provided by the restaurant. The reporter is told not to eat it all, but the crew will eat the rest out of consideration and a feeling of obligation towards the restaurant."[4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food comic artist Raswell Hosoki claimed in Meshizanmai Furusatonoaji (Meshizanmai Taste of Hometown) that the note is true. Eriko Miyazaki , a reporter and TV personality for food shows, also claimed the note is true and stated: "The crew eats the rest of the food, at least at the shows I appear in."[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, Miwa Asao, former professional beach volleyball player and TV personality, posted photos on her blog of staff eating food after recording "Saturday Night! Otona na TV ". She wrote: "This is an on-site photo. The staff ate the rest of the food."[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Refuting reports&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Hitoshi Matsumoto, a comedian and TV host, was asked by sociologist Noritoshi Furuichi about this note in 2014 during the "Wide na Show " (Fuji Television). He said: "To be honest, I've never seen the crew eat the food. But that just means I haven't seen it. They might've eaten it."[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeshi Kitano (also known as Beat Takeshi), a Japanese comedian, actor, and filmmaker, referred to an instance where cake was smeared on the floor and said in his book Bakaron: "Liars. Who's going to enjoy cake they splattered all over the floor?"[3] Commentator Tsunehira Furuya also stated that the food featured in the show is not eaten by the staff later and is instead simply thrown into garbage bags.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reception&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Commentator Tetsuya Uetaki has commented on displaying the note, saying: "Producers have become more aware as viewers have become more critical after issues such as the Aru Aru Mondai (a natto shortage caused by a program claiming eating natto would make people lose weight), and it's fine as one method for dealing with that." However, Uetaki went on to say: "This shifts responsibility onto the viewers. We can't let it end as simply an empty concession. I want to see variety shows strive to properly handle information and properly put the show together, from the moment they start building it."[8]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadcast writer Sotani commented on the fact that production teams have become more sensitive to this in programs and have begun displaying such notes as an attempt to preempt criticism. He claims this sort of extreme self regulation risks leading to a decline.[9] TV producer Kenji Suga claims it is necessary for programs to be disconnected from real life and society, to be "dumb and idiotic" to produce laughs.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Columnist Takashi Matsuo argues that adults, not TV shows, should teach children the ethics surrounding the importance of food. He also argues that if a parent is uncomfortable with what a comedian expresses on TV, the right course of action would be to change the channel or turn off the TV, not send a complaint to the TV station.[10] Matsuo also points out the inconsistency that "the staff ate it later" caption is not displayed when large numbers of tomatoes are thrown at the festival of Tomatina in Spain or when athletes spray each other with champagne in celebration of a victory.[10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ a b c Furuya, Tsunehira (2017). 「道徳自警団」がニッポンを滅ぼす.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Static sites enable a good time travel experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Varun wrote about gamifying blogging and personal website maintenance which reminded me of the time when I awarded myself some badges for blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mentioned this to Varun who asked if I had any screenshots of what it looked like on my website. My initial answer was “no”, then I looked at Wayback Machine but there were not pictures of the badges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, a bit later it hit me. I don’t need any archived screenshots: my website is built with Eleventy and it's static so I can check out a git commit from the time I had those badges up, fire up Eleventy and see the website — as it was in the spring of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a beauty of a static site generator combined with my workflow of fetching posts from CMS before build time so each commit contains a full snapshot of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Comparing this to a website that uses a database for posts (like WordPress) or a flow where posts from CMS are not stored in version control but rather fetched at build time only, my solution makes time travel to (almost) any given moment in time a two-command operation (&lt;code&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt;
  with the right commit hash and
  &lt;code&gt;@11ty/eleventy serve&lt;/code&gt; to serve a dev
  server). I say almost because back in the day I wasn’t quite as diligent in
  commiting every change as I was deploying manually and not through version
  control automation.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year ago, inspired by Alex Chan’s blog post Taking regular screenshots of my website I set up a GitHub Action that takes a snapshot of my front page once a month to keep a record. At the time, I felt bit sad that I hadn’t started it before. However, now that I realised how easy it is for me to go back in time thanks to Eleventy and git, I’m not so worried anymore. Maybe I should do a collage of changes on my design one day by going through my project history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One more major point for static site generators!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If something above resonated with you, let's start a discussion about it! Email me at juhamattisantala at gmail dot com and share your thoughts. In 2025, I want to have more deeper discussions with people from around the world and I'd love if you'd be part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey HN! We’re Abhi, Venkat, Tom, and Nick and we are building Datafruit (&lt;/p&gt;https://datafruit.dev/&lt;p&gt;), an AI DevOps agent. We’re like Devin for DevOps. You can ask Datafruit to check your cloud spend, look for loose security policies, make changes to your IaC, and it can reason across your deployment standards, design docs, and DevOps practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FitSggI7tg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, we have two main methods to interact with Datafruit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) automated infrastructure audits— agents periodically scan your environment to find cost optimization opportunities, detect infrastructure drift, and validate your infra against compliance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) chat interface (available as a web UI and through slack) — ask the agent questions for real-time insights, or assign tasks directly, such as investigating spend anomalies, reviewing security posture, or applying changes to IaC resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working at FAANG and various high-growth startups, we realized that infra work requires an enormous amount of context, often more than traditional software engineering. The business decisions, codebase, and cloud itself are all extremely important in any task that has been assigned. To maximize the success of the agents, we do a fair amount of context engineering. Not hallucinating is super important!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing which has worked incredibly well for us is a multi-agent system where we have specialized sub-agents with access to specific tool calls and documentation for their specialty. Agents choose to “handoff” to each other when they feel like another agent would be more specialized for the task. However, all agents share the same context (https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents). We’re pretty happy with this approach, and believe it could work in other disciplines which require high amounts of specialized expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure is probably the most mission-critical part of any software organization, and needs extremely heavy guardrails to keep it safe. Language models are not yet at the point where they can be trusted to make changes (we’ve talked to a couple of startups where the Claude Code + AWS CLI combo has taken their infra down). Right now, Datafruit receives read-only access to your infrastructure and can only make changes through pull requests to your IaC repositories. The agent also operates in a sandboxed virtual environment so that it could not write cloud CLI commands if it wanted to!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where LLMs can add significant value is in reducing the constant operational inefficiencies that eat up cloud spend and delay deadlines—the small-but-urgent ops work. Once Datafruit indexes your environment, you can ask it to do things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;  "Grant @User write access to analytics S3 bucket for 24 hours"
    -&amp;gt; Creates temporary IAM role, sends least-privilege credentials, auto-revokes tomorrow

  "Find where this secret is used so I can rotate it without downtime"
    -&amp;gt; Discovers all instances of your secret, including old cron-jobs you might not know about, so you can safely rotate your keys


  "Why did database costs spike yesterday?"
    -&amp;gt; Identifies expensive queries, shows optimization options, implements fixes

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; We charge a straightforward subscription model for a managed version, but we also offer a bring-your-own-cloud model. All of Datafruit can be deployed on Kubernetes using Helm charts for enterprise customers where data can’t leave your VPC. For the time being, we’re installing the product ourselves on customers' clouds. It doesn’t exist in a self-serve form yet. We’ll get there eventually, but in the meantime if you’re interested we’d love for you guys to email us at founders@datafruit.dev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would love to hear your thoughts! If you work with cloud infra, we are especially interested in learning about what kinds of work you do which you wish could be offloaded onto an agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;‘World Models,’ an Old Idea in AI, Mount a Comeback&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest ambition of artificial intelligence research — particularly within the labs seeking “artificial general intelligence,” or AGI — is something called a world model: a representation of the environment that an AI carries around inside itself like a computational snow globe. The AI system can use this simplified representation to evaluate predictions and decisions before applying them to its real-world tasks. The deep learning luminaries Yann LeCun (of Meta), Demis Hassabis (of Google DeepMind) and Yoshua Bengio (of Mila, the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute) all believe world models are essential for building AI systems that are truly smart, scientific and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fields of psychology, robotics and machine learning have each been using some version of the concept for decades. You likely have a world model running inside your skull right now — it’s how you know not to step in front of a moving train without needing to run the experiment first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So does this mean that AI researchers have finally found a core concept whose meaning everyone can agree upon? As a famous physicist once wrote: Surely you’re joking. A world model may sound straightforward — but as usual, no one can agree on the details. What gets represented in the model, and to what level of fidelity? Is it innate or learned, or some combination of both? And how do you detect that it’s even there at all?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It helps to know where the whole idea started. In 1943, a dozen years before the term “artificial intelligence” was coined, a 29-year-old Scottish psychologist named Kenneth Craik published an influential monograph in which he mused that “if the organism carries a ‘small-scale model’ of external reality … within its head, it is able to try out various alternatives, conclude which is the best of them … and in every way to react in a much fuller, safer, and more competent manner.” Craik’s notion of a mental model or simulation presaged the “cognitive revolution” that transformed psychology in the 1950s and still rules the cognitive sciences today. What’s more, it directly linked cognition with computation: Craik considered the “power to parallel or model external events” to be “the fundamental feature” of both “neural machinery” and “calculating machines.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The nascent field of artificial intelligence eagerly adopted the world-modeling approach. In the late 1960s, an AI system called SHRDLU wowed observers by using a rudimentary “block world” to answer commonsense questions about tabletop objects, like “Can a pyramid support a block?” But these handcrafted models couldn’t scale up to handle the complexity of more realistic settings. By the late 1980s, the AI and robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks had given up on world models completely, famously asserting that “the world is its own best model” and “explicit representations … simply get in the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took the rise of machine learning, especially deep learning based on artificial neural networks, to breathe life back into Craik’s brainchild. Instead of relying on brittle hand-coded rules, deep neural networks could build up internal approximations of their training environments through trial and error and then use them to accomplish narrowly specified tasks, such as driving a virtual race car. In the past few years, as the large language models behind chatbots like ChatGPT began to demonstrate emergent capabilities that they weren’t explicitly trained for — like inferring movie titles from strings of emojis, or playing the board game Othello — world models provided a convenient explanation for the mystery. To prominent AI experts such as Geoffrey Hinton, Ilya Sutskever and Chris Olah, it was obvious: Buried somewhere deep within an LLM’s thicket of virtual neurons must lie “a small-scale model of external reality,” just as Craik imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The truth, at least so far as we know, is less impressive. Instead of world models, today’s generative AIs appear to learn “bags of heuristics”: scores of disconnected rules of thumb that can approximate responses to specific scenarios, but don’t cohere into a consistent whole. (Some may actually contradict each other.) It’s a lot like the parable of the blind men and the elephant, where each man only touches one part of the animal at a time and fails to apprehend its full form. One man feels the trunk and assumes the entire elephant is snakelike; another touches a leg and guesses it’s more like a tree; a third grasps the elephant’s tail and says it’s a rope. When researchers attempt to recover evidence of a world model from within an LLM — for example, a coherent computational representation of an Othello game board — they’re looking for the whole elephant. What they find instead is a bit of snake here, a chunk of tree there, and some rope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, such heuristics are hardly worthless. LLMs can encode untold sackfuls of them within their trillions of parameters — and as the old saw goes, quantity has a quality all its own. That’s what makes it possible to train a language model to generate nearly perfect directions between any two points in Manhattan without learning a coherent world model of the entire street network in the process, as researchers from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if bits of snake, tree and rope can do the job, why bother with the elephant? In a word, robustness: When the researchers threw their Manhattan-navigating LLM a mild curveball by randomly blocking 1% of the streets, its performance cratered. If the AI had simply encoded a street map whose details were consistent — instead of an immensely complicated, corner-by-corner patchwork of conflicting best guesses — it could have easily rerouted around the obstructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the benefits that even simple world models can confer, it’s easy to understand why every large AI lab is desperate to develop them — and why academic researchers are increasingly interested in scrutinizing them, too. Robust and verifiable world models could uncover, if not the El Dorado of AGI, then at least a scientifically plausible tool for extinguishing AI hallucinations, enabling reliable reasoning, and increasing the interpretability of AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the “what” and “why” of world models. The “how,” though, is still anyone’s guess. Google DeepMind and OpenAI are betting that with enough “multimodal” training data — like video, 3D simulations, and other input beyond mere text — a world model will spontaneously congeal within a neural network’s statistical soup. Meta’s LeCun, meanwhile, thinks that an entirely new (and non-generative) AI architecture will provide the necessary scaffolding. In the quest to build these computational snow globes, no one has a crystal ball — but the prize, for once, may just be worth the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

A&lt;code&gt;HTMLTemplateElement&lt;/code&gt;cannot subsequently be changed into a shadow root after parsing, for example, by setting&lt;code&gt;HTMLTemplateElement.shadowRootMode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Note: You may find the non-standard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;shadowroot&lt;/code&gt;attribute in older tutorials and examples that used to be supported in Chrome 90-110.

If set, a clone of the shadow host (the parent element of this&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) created with&lt;code&gt;Node.cloneNode()&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;Document.importNode()&lt;/code&gt;will include a shadow root in the copy.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-5"&gt;&lt;code&gt;shadowrootdelegatesfocus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sets the value of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;delegatesFocus&lt;/code&gt;property of a&lt;code&gt;ShadowRoot&lt;/code&gt;created using this element to&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. If this is set and a non-focusable element in the shadow tree is selected, then focus is delegated to the first focusable element in the tree. The value defaults to&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-6"&gt;&lt;code&gt;shadowrootserializable&lt;/code&gt;Experimental&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sets the value of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;serializable&lt;/code&gt;property of a&lt;code&gt;ShadowRoot&lt;/code&gt;created using this element to&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. If set, the shadow root may be serialized by calling the&lt;code&gt;Element.getHTML()&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;ShadowRoot.getHTML()&lt;/code&gt;methods with the&lt;code&gt;options.serializableShadowRoots&lt;/code&gt;parameter set&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. The value defaults to&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Usage notes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This element has no permitted content, because everything nested inside it in the HTML source does not actually become the children of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. The &lt;code&gt;Node.childNodes&lt;/code&gt; property of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is always empty, and you can only access said nested content via the special &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; property. However, if you call &lt;code&gt;Node.appendChild()&lt;/code&gt; or similar methods on the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, then you would be inserting children into the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element itself, which is a violation of its content model and does not actually update the &lt;code&gt;DocumentFragment&lt;/code&gt; returned by the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the way the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is parsed, all &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; opening and closing tags inside the template are syntax errors and are ignored by the parser, so &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Test&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Test&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways to use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Template document fragment&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, the element's content is not rendered. The corresponding &lt;code&gt;HTMLTemplateElement&lt;/code&gt; interface includes a standard &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; property (without an equivalent content/markup attribute). This &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; property is read-only and holds a &lt;code&gt;DocumentFragment&lt;/code&gt; that contains the DOM subtree represented by the template.
This fragment can be cloned via the &lt;code&gt;cloneNode&lt;/code&gt; method and inserted into the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be careful when using the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; property because the returned &lt;code&gt;DocumentFragment&lt;/code&gt; can exhibit unexpected behavior.
For more details, see the Avoiding DocumentFragment pitfalls section below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Declarative Shadow DOM&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element contains the &lt;code&gt;shadowrootmode&lt;/code&gt; attribute with a value of either &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;closed&lt;/code&gt;, the HTML parser will immediately generate a shadow DOM. The element is replaced in the DOM by its content wrapped in a &lt;code&gt;ShadowRoot&lt;/code&gt;, which is attached to the parent element.
This is the declarative equivalent of calling &lt;code&gt;Element.attachShadow()&lt;/code&gt; to attach a shadow root to an element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the element has any other value for &lt;code&gt;shadowrootmode&lt;/code&gt;, or does not have the &lt;code&gt;shadowrootmode&lt;/code&gt; attribute, the parser generates a &lt;code&gt;HTMLTemplateElement&lt;/code&gt;.
Similarly, if there are multiple declarative shadow roots, only the first one is replaced by a &lt;code&gt;ShadowRoot&lt;/code&gt; â subsequent instances are parsed as &lt;code&gt;HTMLTemplateElement&lt;/code&gt; objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Examples&lt;/head&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Generating table rows&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;First we start with the HTML portion of the example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table id="producttable"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;thead&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;UPC_Code&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Product_Name&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/thead&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;!-- existing data could optionally be included here --&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;template id="productrow"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;td class="record"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we have a table into which we will later insert content using JavaScript code. Then comes the template, which describes the structure of an HTML fragment representing a single table row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the table has been created and the template defined, we use JavaScript to insert rows into the table, with each row being constructed using the template as its basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Test to see if the browser supports the HTML template element by checking
// for the presence of the template element's content attribute.
if ("content" in document.createElement("template")) {
  // Instantiate the table with the existing HTML tbody
  // and the row with the template
  const tbody = document.querySelector("tbody");
  const template = document.querySelector("#productrow");

  // Clone the new row and insert it into the table
  const clone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
  let td = clone.querySelectorAll("td");
  td[0].textContent = "1235646565";
  td[1].textContent = "Stuff";

  tbody.appendChild(clone);

  // Clone the new row and insert it into the table
  const clone2 = template.content.cloneNode(true);
  td = clone2.querySelectorAll("td");
  td[0].textContent = "0384928528";
  td[1].textContent = "Acme Kidney Beans 2";

  tbody.appendChild(clone2);
} else {
  // Find another way to add the rows to the table because
  // the HTML template element is not supported.
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is the original HTML table, with two new rows appended to it via JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementing a declarative shadow DOM&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example, a hidden support warning is included at the beginning of the markup. This warning is later set to be displayed via JavaScript if the browser doesn't support the &lt;code&gt;shadowrootmode&lt;/code&gt; attribute. Next, there are two &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements, each containing nested &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements with different behaviors. The first &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is global to the whole document. The second one is scoped to the shadow root generated in place of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element because of the presence of the &lt;code&gt;shadowrootmode&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p hidden&amp;gt;
  â Your browser doesn't support &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;shadowrootmode&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; attribute yet.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
    p {
      padding: 8px;
      background-color: wheat;
    }
  &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I'm in the DOM.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;template shadowrootmode="open"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
      p {
        padding: 8px;
        background-color: plum;
      }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I'm in the shadow DOM.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;const isShadowRootModeSupported = Object.hasOwn(
  HTMLTemplateElement.prototype,
  "shadowRootMode",
);

document
  .querySelector("p[hidden]")
  .toggleAttribute("hidden", isShadowRootModeSupported);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Declarative Shadow DOM with delegated focus&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This example demonstrates how &lt;code&gt;shadowrootdelegatesfocus&lt;/code&gt; is applied to a shadow root that is created declaratively, and the effect this has on focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code first declares a shadow root inside a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element with the &lt;code&gt;shadowrootmode&lt;/code&gt; attribute.
This displays both a non-focusable &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; containing text and a focusable &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.
It also uses CSS to style elements with &lt;code&gt;:focus&lt;/code&gt; to blue, and to set the normal styling of the host element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;template shadowrootmode="open"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
      :host {
        display: block;
        border: 1px dotted black;
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
      }
      :focus {
        outline: 2px solid blue;
      }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Clickable Shadow DOM text&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input type="text" placeholder="Input inside Shadow DOM" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second code block is identical except that it sets the &lt;code&gt;shadowrootdelegatesfocus&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which delegates focus to the first focusable element in the tree if a non-focusable element in the tree is selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;template shadowrootmode="open" shadowrootdelegatesfocus&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
      :host {
        display: block;
        border: 1px dotted black;
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
      }
      :focus {
        outline: 2px solid blue;
      }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Clickable Shadow DOM text&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input type="text" placeholder="Input inside Shadow DOM" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last of all we use the following CSS to apply a red border to the parent &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element when it has focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;div:focus {
  border: 2px solid red;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are shown below. When the HTML is first rendered, the elements have no styling, as shown in the first image. For the shadow root that does not have &lt;code&gt;shadowrootdelegatesfocus&lt;/code&gt; set you can click anywhere except the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the focus does not change (if you select the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element it will look like the second image).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the shadow root with &lt;code&gt;shadowrootdelegatesfocus&lt;/code&gt; set, clicking on the text (which is non-focusable) selects the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, as this is the first focusable element in the tree.
This also focuses the parent element as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Avoiding DocumentFragment pitfalls&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a &lt;code&gt;DocumentFragment&lt;/code&gt; value is passed, &lt;code&gt;Node.appendChild&lt;/code&gt; and similar methods move only the child nodes of that value into the target node. Therefore, it is usually preferable to attach event handlers to the children of a &lt;code&gt;DocumentFragment&lt;/code&gt;, rather than to the &lt;code&gt;DocumentFragment&lt;/code&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following HTML and JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HTML&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="container"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;template id="template"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Click me&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;const container = document.getElementById("container");
const template = document.getElementById("template");

function clickHandler(event) {
  event.target.append(" â Clicked this div");
}

const firstClone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
firstClone.addEventListener("click", clickHandler);
container.appendChild(firstClone);

const secondClone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
secondClone.children[0].addEventListener("click", clickHandler);
container.appendChild(secondClone);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Result&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;firstClone&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;DocumentFragment&lt;/code&gt;, only its children are added to &lt;code&gt;container&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;appendChild&lt;/code&gt; is called; the event handlers of &lt;code&gt;firstClone&lt;/code&gt; are not copied. In contrast, because an event handler is added to the first child node of &lt;code&gt;secondClone&lt;/code&gt;, the event handler is copied when &lt;code&gt;appendChild&lt;/code&gt; is called, and clicking on it works as one would expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical summary&lt;/head&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Content categories&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Metadata content, flow content, phrasing content, script-supporting element&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Permitted content&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Nothing (see Usage notes)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Tag omission&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Permitted parents&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; Any element that accepts metadata content, phrasing content, or script-supporting elements. Also allowed as a child of a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;colgroup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
        element that does not have a
        &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; attribute.
      &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Implicit ARIA role&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;No corresponding role&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Permitted ARIA roles&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;No &lt;code&gt;role&lt;/code&gt; permitted&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;DOM interface&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;HTMLTemplateElement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Specifications&lt;/head&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Specification&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;HTML&amp;gt;&lt;p&gt;# the-template-element&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Browser compatibility&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loadingâ¦&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;exportparts&lt;/code&gt;HTML attributes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;slot&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;HTML element&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;:has-slotted&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;:host&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;:host()&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;:host-context()&lt;/code&gt;CSS pseudo-classes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;::part&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;::slotted&lt;/code&gt;CSS pseudo-elements&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ShadowRoot&lt;/code&gt;interface&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Using templates and slots&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CSS scoping module&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Declarative Shadow DOM (with html) in Using Shadow DOM&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Declarative shadow DOM on web.dev (2023)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introduction to Ada: a project-based exploration with rosettas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;by Romain Gora –&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This practical walkthrough, designed as a short tutorial, was created upon joining AdaCore as a Field Engineer. In this new role, Iâll be working directly with customers to help them succeed with Ada. Although I was first introduced to the language nearly two decades ago, this new position inspired me to revisit its fundamentals, and I used the excellent https://learn.adacore.com portal as a quick refresher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While that platform takes a concept-based approach, I chose to complement it with a project-based method by developing a small, end-to-end Ada program that generates animated rosettas in the form of SVG files. These are technically hypotrochoid curves, producing patterns that many will recognize from the classic Spirographâ¢ toy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this walkthrough, weâll show that Ada can be fun and easy to learn. Although the language is famous for safety-critical systems, we will use it as a modern, general-purpose programming language and try out some new features from Ada 2022 along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A brief note on Ada&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section leans a bit more into background context, with a slightly encyclopedic flavor that's especially useful for readers new to Ada. If you're already familiar with Adaâs history and principles, feel free to joyfully skip ahead to the next section!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ada was created in the late 1970s after a call from the U.S. Department of Defense to unify its fragmented software landscape. The winning proposal became Ada, a language that's been literally battle-tested (!) and built on a deeply thought-out design that continues to evolve today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Ada is absolutely a general-purpose programming language, it has carved out a strong niche in fields where software correctness and reliability are mission-critical:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Embedded and real-time systems&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Aerospace and defense&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rail, automotive, and aviation&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Any system where failure is not just a bug, but a risk&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its strict compile-time checks, safety features, and clear structure make it particularly appealing when you need your software to be dependable from day one and still maintainable ten years later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ada's design is grounded in a strong and principled philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Readability over conciseness: Ada favors clarity. It avoids symbols and abbreviations in favor of full keywords, making the language more accessible and less error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Strong and explicit typing: It is extremely easy to declare new types in Ada, with precise constraints, which makes it much harder to accidentally misuse data. While some functional languages share this strong typing discipline, Ada stands out by requiring the programmer to be very explicit. It uses little to no type inference.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Explicit is better than implicit: Unlike many modern languages that prioritize convenience, Ada leans heavily toward precision. Most types must be explicitly named and matched.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Defined semantics and minimal undefined behavior: Ada offers a level of predictability and safety unmatched in many languages. This makes it a strong choice not only for safety-critical systems, but also for codebases where long-term maintenance, verifiability, and correctness are essential.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compiler as a partner: Ada compilers are strict by design, not to frustrate, but to help the programmer write clearer, more correct code. This philosophy encourages the developer to communicate intent clearly, both to the compiler and to future readers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the program works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best way to figure out how something works is to start at the end. Let's do that!&lt;lb/&gt;In this tutorial, we'll walk through how the program produces its final output â a rosetta SVG file â and use that as a way to explore how Ada's structure, type system, and tooling come together.&lt;lb/&gt;This is a simple command-line program that generates an SVG file. You run it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;./bin/rosetta&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea was to create something visual: learning is more fun when there's an immediate, satisfying result and generating rosettas fits that goal perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Why SVG? Because it's a lightweight and portable vector format that you can view in any modern browser. I wanted to avoid relying on a graphical library, which would have added extra weight and gone beyond the scope of this approach. And while XML isn't the most pleasant format to write by hand, generating it from code is straightforward and gives a surprisingly clean result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tooling &amp;amp; setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build and run the project, I used Alire, the Ada package manager. It plays a similar role in the Ada ecosystem as Cargo does for Rust or npm for JavaScript. It's well-documented, and while we won't dive deep into it here, it's a solid and accessible way to manage Ada projects. I encourage anyone curious to get it from https://alire.ada.dev. Interestingly, "Alire" is also the French expression for "Ã lire" â which means "for reading." A fitting name for a tool that supports a language so focused on clarity and readability!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once Alire is set up, the natural next step is choosing where to write the code. You have two excellent options for your development environment. For a dedicated experience, you can download the latest release of GNAT Studio from its GitHub repository. If you prefer a more general-purpose editor, you can install the official Ada &amp;amp; SPARK for Visual Studio Code extension from AdaCore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a new learner, I also kept https://learn.adacore.com close at hand. Itâs a particularly clear and comprehensive resource â and I especially appreciated being able to download the ebook version and read through it on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Entry point&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;with Rosetta_Renderer;

procedure Main is
begin
   Rosetta_Renderer.Put_SVG_Rosettas;
end Main;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several interesting things to notice right away:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt;clause is not a preprocessor directive like in C or C++. Itâs a compiled, checked reference to another package â a reliable and explicit way to express a dependency. This eliminates entire classes of bugs related to fragile&lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt;chains, macro collisions, or dependency order issues.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;This&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;procedure&lt;/code&gt;is not a&lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt;: it does not return a value. In Ada, procedures are used to perform actions (like printing or modifying state), and functions are used to compute and query values.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The syntax is designed for readability. Youâll find&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;here instead of&lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;as in C/C++, reinforcing Adaâs philosophy that clarity matters more than brevity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Put_SVG_Rosettas&lt;/code&gt;uses the idiomatic Pascal_Snake_Case naming style. This reflects a common Ada convention and avoids acronyms or compressed identifiers in favor of more descriptive names.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The entry point is minimal but meaningful: it simply calls a procedure which generates the output we'll explore in the next sections.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Geometry and computation (package Rosetta)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Ada, a package is a modular unit that groups related types, procedures, and functions. Following the convention from GNAT (the Ada compiler, part of the GNU Compiler Collection, fondly known as GCC), each package has a specification file (with the&lt;code&gt; .ads&lt;/code&gt; extension â short for Ada Specification) and an implementation file (with the &lt;code&gt;.adb&lt;/code&gt; extension â short for Ada Body). This clear and enforced split means you always know where to find interface definitions versus their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following code is the package specification for Rosetta. It defines the data types for the rosetta shapes and declares the public interface of operations available to manipulate them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;with Ada.Strings.Text_Buffers;

package Rosetta is

   --  A mathematical description of a rosetta (specifically, a hypotrochoid).
   --  formed by tracing a point attached to a circle rolling inside another circle.
   type Hypotrochoid is record
      Outer_Radius : Float;     --  Radius of the fixed outer circle.
      Inner_Radius : Float;     --  Radius of the rolling inner circle.
      Pen_Offset   : Float;     --  From the center of the inner circle to the drawing point.
      Steps        : Positive;  --  Number of steps (points) used to approximate the curve.
   end record;

   --  A 2D coordinate in Cartesian space.
   type Coordinate is record
      X_Coord, Y_Coord : Float;
   end record
     with Put_Image =&amp;gt; Put_Image_Coordinate;
   
   --  Redefines the 'Image attribute for Coordinate.
   procedure Put_Image_Coordinate 
     (Output : in out Ada.Strings.Text_Buffers.Root_Buffer_Type'Class; 
      Value  : Coordinate);

   --  A type for an unconstrained array of 2D points forming a curve.
   --  The actual bounds are set when an array object of this type is declared.
   type Coordinate_Array is array (Natural range &amp;lt;&amp;gt;) of Coordinate;

   --  Computes the coordinates of the rosetta curve defined by Curve (a hypotrochoid).
   --  Returns a centered array of coordinates.
   function Compute_Points (Curve : Hypotrochoid) return Coordinate_Array;

end Rosetta;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Rosetta&lt;/code&gt; package is responsible for all the math and curve computation. It defines:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hypotrochoid&lt;/code&gt;, type describing the geometry of the rosetta&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Coordinate&lt;/code&gt;, type representing points in 2D space&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Coordinate_Array&lt;/code&gt;, type holding a series of such points&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Compute_Points&lt;/code&gt;, function which calculates all the points of the curve based on the&lt;code&gt;Hypotrochoid&lt;/code&gt;parameters and recenters them around the origin&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This package is focused solely on computation. It doesnât concern itself with how the result is rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact for the curious: when the rolling circle rolls outside the fixed circle rather than inside, the resulting curve is called an epitrochoid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Ada, a &lt;code&gt;record&lt;/code&gt; is similar to a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; in C or a class with only data members in other languages. It's a user-defined type composed of named components, making it ideal for modeling structured data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using a record for &lt;code&gt;Hypotrochoid&lt;/code&gt; was particularly appropriate: it allows grouping all geometric parameters (outer radius, inner radius, pen offset, and steps) into a single, cohesive unit. This improves readability and maintainability. The compiler enforces correctness by ensuring all required values are present and of the expected type â reinforcing Adaâs philosophy of clarity and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The type &lt;code&gt;Coordinate_Array&lt;/code&gt; is an unconstrained array type that holds a range of &lt;code&gt;Coordinate&lt;/code&gt; records. In this context, âunconstrainedâ simply means that we donât define the arrayâs size when we declare the type. Instead, the size is defined when we declare an object of that type. This gives us the flexibility to use this type for a variety of shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may also notice the use of &lt;code&gt;Natural range &amp;lt;&amp;gt;. Natural&lt;/code&gt; is a predefined subtype of Integer that only allows non-negative values. And yes, I mean subtype: Adaâs powerful type system allows you to take an existing type and create a more specific, constrained version of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Highlights from the .adb file&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few notable aspects from the implementation (&lt;code&gt;rosetta.adb&lt;/code&gt;) that illustrate Adaâs strengths for writing safe, clear, and structured code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declarative and modular design: Both&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Generate_Point&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Compute_Points&lt;/code&gt;are pure functions that operate only on their inputs. Their behavior is fully deterministic and encapsulated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe bounds and array handling: The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Points&lt;/code&gt;array is statically bounded using&lt;code&gt;(0 .. Curve.Steps)&lt;/code&gt;, and its access is strictly safe. The compiler ensures that any index outside this range would raise an error at runtime. This immediate error is a feature, not a bug. It stops silent memory corruption and security flaws by ensuring the program fails predictably and safely at the source of the problem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of constants for robustness: Variables such as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pi&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;R_Diff&lt;/code&gt;, and Ratio are declared as constant, enforcing immutability. This helps ensure clarity of intent and prevents accidental reassignment, a common source of subtle bugs in more permissive languages. Ada encourages this explicit declaration style, promoting safer code.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On style: strict and predictable (and satisfying!)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ada is one of those rare languages that not only compiles your code but asks you to write it properly. With the compiler switch -gnaty, you can enforce a comprehensive set of style rules, many of which are stricter than what you'd see in most languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This includes things like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No trailing whitespace at the end of lines&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No consecutive blank lines&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proper indentation and alignment of keywords and parameters&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A space before â(â when calling a procedure or function&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consistent casing&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first, this can feel surprisingly strict. But once you get used to it, the benefits are clear: it helps enforce a consistent and clean coding style across a codebase. That in turn improves readability, reduces ambiguity, and leads to more maintainable programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than leaving formatting up to personal taste or optional linter tools, Ada integrates this attention to detail into the compilation process itself. The result is not only more elegant: it's genuinely satisfying. And you can do even more with GNATcheck and GNATformat but itâs outside of the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outputting to SVG (package &lt;code&gt;Rosetta_Renderer&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rosetta_Renderer package is responsible for producing the SVG output. It defines a single high-level procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;package Rosetta_Renderer is

   --  Renders a predefined set of rosettas into an SVG output.
   procedure Put_SVG_Rosettas;

end Rosetta_Renderer;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This procedure generates an SVG file directly. It takes care of formatting the SVG structure (header, shapes, animations, and footer) and calls into the math logic defined in the &lt;code&gt;Rosetta &lt;/code&gt;package to generate point data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This separation of concerns is deliberate and beneficial: the math logic doesnât need to know anything about SVG, and the renderer doesnât care how the coordinates were generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let's talk about the body of the package... but not for long. We're keeping it brief because its core is essentially the SVG plumbing required to draw and animate the curves, so we'll skip the fine details. And for those who enjoy seeing how the sausage is made, I've made the fully commented source code available for you right here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The procedure &lt;code&gt;Put_Path&lt;/code&gt; handles the creation of the SVG path. Its main job is to take an array of coordinates and write the corresponding command string to the &lt;code&gt;d &lt;/code&gt;attribute of a&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. In SVG, this attribute defines the geometry of the shape. The code iterates over each coordinate, using &lt;code&gt;M &lt;/code&gt;(moveto) for the first point and &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt; (lineto) for all the others to draw the connecting lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;--  Puts coordinates to a single SVG path string ("d" attribute).
   procedure Put_Path (Stream : File_Type; Points : Coordinate_Array) is
   begin
      Put (Stream, "M "); -- Moves the pen without drawing.
      for J in Points'Range loop
         declare 
            Coord_Text : constant String := Coordinate'Image (Points (J));
         begin   
            Put (Stream, Coord_Text);
            if J &amp;lt; Points'Last then
               Put (Stream, " L "); --  Draws a line.
            end if;
         end;
      end loop;
   end Put_Path;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Afterword&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This small project was an enjoyable and useful way to get back into Ada. It helped me reconnect with the languageâs main strengths and refamiliarize myself with its tools and design. It was a great reminder of how fun, easy to learn, and remarkably modern Ada can be, especially for developers focused on building robust, maintainable, and efficient software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this short walkthrough gives a good idea of that feeling, whether you're already into Ada or just starting to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this interactive article, we will explore the physical phenomena that create light and the fundamental laws governing its interaction with matter. We will learn how our human eyes capture light and how our brains interpret it as visual information. We will then model approximations of these physical interactions and learn how to create physically realistic renderings of various materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are all familiar with light: it’s the thing that allows us to see the world, distinguish colors and textures, and keeps the universe from being a dark, lifeless void. But precisely defining what light is has proven to be a tricky question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout history, many philosophers (and later, physicists) studied light in an effort to demystify its nature. Some ancient Greeks considered it to be one of the four fundamental elements that composed the universe: beams of fire emanating from our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descartes proposed that light behaved like waves, while Newton thought that it consisted of tiny particles of matter called corpuscles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these more or less scientific theories explained some aspects of light's behavior, but none could account for all of them in a single, unified framework. That was until the 1920s when physicists came up with quantum electrodynamics. This theory is, as of now, the most accurate way to describe every interaction of light and matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can hover the diagram below to see which light's phenomena can be explained using each model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the purpose of computer graphics, the ray optics model is accurate enough at simulating light interactions. But for the sake of scientific curiosity, we will explore some aspects of the other models, starting with electromagnetism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental properties of matter is the electric charge, and it comes in two types: positive and negative.&lt;lb/&gt;Charges determine how particles interact: charges of the same type repel each other, while opposite charges attract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amount of force affecting two charged particles is calculated using Coulomb's law:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where is a constant, and are the quantities of each charge, and is the distance between them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can drag around these charges to see how the electric force affects them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every charge contributes to the electric field, it represents the force exerted on other charges at each point in space. We can visualize the electric field with a or a :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another way to visualize the electric field is by coloring each point in space with a color gradient representing the force experienced by a small charge at that point:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a moving object carrying a positive electric charge placed under a cable carrying an electrical current.&lt;lb/&gt; From , the object and the negative charges in the wire are moving, and since the positive and negative charges in the cable compensate each other, the object doesn't experience any force.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the , it appears to be static alongside the negative charges, while the positive charges are moving to the left, and the object still doesn't get affected by any force.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now if we take into account , the moving charges in the wire appear "stretched" due to relativistic effects, causing a change in the distribution of charges. This stretching leads to a repulsive force between the object and the wire, which we interpret as magnetism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are created and interact with each other. We will focus on the third and fourth equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maxwell's third equation, known as Faraday's law of induction, shows how changing magnetic fields can generate electric currents.&lt;lb/&gt;An example of this is moving a magnet inside a coil, which induces an electric current in the wire due to the changing magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the principle behind electric generators: Mechanical energy (like the flow of steam) is used to move magnets inside coils (a turbine), converting it to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By moving the magnet left and right, we can see the voltmeter picking up a current and the electric charges in the coil moving back and forth:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maxwell's fourth and final equation, Ampère's Law, illustrates how electric currents (moving charges) produce magnetic fields around them. This is the basis of how electromagnets function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these laws demonstrate how electric and magnetic fields are interdependent. A changing magnetic field generates an electric field, and a changing electric field generates a magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This continuous cycle enables self-sustaining, self-propagating electromagnetic waves, which can travel through space without requiring a medium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic radiation consists of waves created by synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields. These waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amplitude of a wave determines the maximum strength of its electric or magnetic field. It represents the wave's intensity or "brightness". In quantum terms, a higher amplitude corresponds to a greater number of photons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The frequency of a wave determines the energy of the individual photons that compose it. Higher frequencies correspond to shorter wavelengths and more energetic photons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the wavelength falls between approximately 400 nm and 700 nm, the human eye perceives it as visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While other wavelengths are invisible to the human eye, many are quite familiar in everyday life. For example, microwaves are used for Wi-Fi and cooking, X-rays are used in medical imaging, and radio waves enable communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some insects, like bees, can see ultraviolet light, which helps them locate flowers by revealing hidden patterns and markings created by specialized pigments, such as flavonoids, that reflect UV wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, gamma rays are highly energetic and can be dangerous, they are generated by radioactive decay, nuclear bombs, and space phenomena like supernovas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many ways for light to be generated, the two most common ones we encounter everyday are incandescence and electroluminescence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incandescence is the process by which a material emits visible light due to high temperature. It is how incandescent lightbulbs and the sun generates light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An incandescent lightbulb produces light through the heating of a filament until it starts glowing. The filament is made of tungsten, an element with a high melting point, high durability, and a positive temperature coefficient of resistance, which means its resistance increases with temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we increase the current flowing through the filament, it starts heating up (Due to Joule heating), which increases the resistance in turn causing more heat to get dissipated. This feedback loop stabilizes at around 2500°C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This heat makes the electrons in the filament wiggle and collide with each other, releasing photons in the process. This radiation can be approximated as Black-body radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sun also generates light by incandescence, but unlike the lightbulb's filament glowing via Joule heating, the Sun’s energy is produced by nuclear fusion in the core, where hydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium and release photons as gamma rays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These photons travel from the core through the radiative zone, getting absorbed and remitted countless times while shifting to longer wavelengths. After hundreds of thousands of years of bouncing around, the photons make it to the surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, where they get radiated away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most (~49%) of the sun's emissions are in infrared, which is responsible for the heat we get on Earth, ~43% is visible light and the ~8% left is ultraviolet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interesting fact is that illustrations of the Sun's cross-section typically depict the interior with bright orange or yellow colors. However, if we could actually see a cross-section of the Sun, even the hottest regions like the core would appear dark and opaque, because the radiation generated there isn't in the visible spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another way to generate light is by electroluminescence, this is the phenomenon that powers LEDs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main component of a light-emitting diode is a semiconductor chip. Semiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivity can be modified by mixing them with impurities in a process known as doping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of impurity (called the dopant) used in the mix, the semiconductor can be turned into either an n-type, which has extra electrons freely moving around, or a p-type, which has a lack of electrons and instead carrying an electron "hole", also moving around and acting as a positive charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you stick a p-type and an n-type semiconductor side by side, they form a p-n junction. When a current flows through the junction, the electrons and the holes recombine and emit photons in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from incandescence and electroluminescence, which are the two most common sources of light we encounter in everyday life, light can come from other places. Some materials glow when exposed to ultraviolet radiation, others absorb that radiation and re-emit it after some time. Some animals like fireflies use special enzymes to produce light. You can read this page to learn more about other sources of luminescence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the previous chapter, we examined the nature of light and the various methods by which it can be emitted, we will now focus on how it interacts with matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a photon hits a material, it interacts with the electrons in the atoms and molecules of that material, then two things can happen, it can either be absorbed or scattered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The electrons occupy atomic orbitals: regions around the nucleus of the atom where an electron is most likely to be found. A higher orbital corresponds to a higher energy level of the electron.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the photon has the energy needed to excite the electron to a higher energy level, the photon can be absorbed. Eventually the electron returns to a lower level and releases the energy as heat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the photon does not get absorbed, its electric field will make the electrons oscillate in return and generate secondary waves that interfere constructively and destructively with the photon waves in complicated ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can simplify these complicated interactions by making a few assumptions about the material:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can use Maxwell's equations to show that such a perfect flat material splits the incoming light waves into two parts: reflected and refracted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence relative to the normal of the surface, as per the law of reflection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The angle of refraction is determined by how much slower (or faster) light travels through the material, that speed is defined by the index of refraction, and the angle is calculated using Snell's law:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a and refractive indices light is no longer refracted and seems to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amount of light that is reflected and refracted is calculated using Fresnel equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, computing the full Fresnel equation in real time can be slow, so in 1994 Christophe Schlick came up with an approximation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First we compute the reflectance at zero degrees from the normal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we plug in the approximation function for the reflectance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transmitted (or refracted) light simply becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we try the where the refracted ray disappeared, we can now see it getting reflected back inside the medium, this is called total internal reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total internal reflection gives rise to an interesting phenomenon called Snell's window. If you dive underwater and look up, the light above the surface is refracted through a circular window 96 degrees wide, and everything outside is a reflection of the bottom of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what it looks underwater:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like we saw earlier, we can explain light reflecting and refracting using different models, depending on the size of the surface irregularities we are considering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, wave optics explains light interacting with matter as light waves diffracting on the surface nanogeometry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we zoom out a bit and use ray optics, we consider light as straight line rays that reflect and refract on the surface microgeometry. With this model we can use the optical laws we described earlier: law of reflection, Snell's law, Fresnel equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now for rendering, we can zoom out even further and consider one pixel at a time, each pixel contains many microgeometry surfaces that we call a microfacet. We can use a statistical average of the microfacets in a pixel to simulate the appearance of the surface at that pixel, without considering each individual microfacet which would be unfeasible in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Size&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Model&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Phenomenon&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Nanogeometry&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Wave optics&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Light diffraction&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Microgeometry&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ray optics&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reflection/refraction, change in local normal&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Macrogeometry&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;BRDF&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Statistical average over a pixel, wider cone -&amp;gt; more roughness&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we can see a microgeometry surface, changing the roughness makes it more bumpy and the microfacets normals aren't aligned anymore:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the macrogeometry level, a bigger roughness value means light rays have a wider cone where they can spread out. The function that describes this cone is called bidirectional reflectance distribution function, we will discuss it in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our microfacet model, we distinguish two types of materials by the nature of their interaction with light: metals and non-metals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metals have a sea of free electrons that absorb light very easily when the photons enter a few nanometers deep inside the surface. The light that isn't absorbed is reflected equally across the visible light spectrum, this is why metals have that distinct "silvery" gray color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notable exceptions are gold, copper, osmium and caesium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changing the roughness of a metal only changes its specular reflection, making it more or less mirror-like. But there is no diffuse reflection at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also called dielectrics, these are materials that do not conduct electricity (insulators). They include plastic, wood, glass, water, diamond, air...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a photon hits a dielectric material, it only gets absorbed if it's energy matches the electron's energy in the material. So light either gets reflected, and the specular reflection depends on the roughness of the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The light can also get refracted inside the dielectric material, it bounces around and interacts with the pigments inside the material until it exits the surface, this is called diffuse reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we take the example of a red apple. When we shine a white light (which contains all visible wavelengths) on it, the apple's pigments (anthocyanins) absorb most of the wavelengths like violet, blue and green wavelengths, thus decreasing the intensity of those colors from the light. The remaining wavelengths, mostly red, gets scattered off the apple's surface making us perceive the apple as red.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can characterize the incoming light by describing the amount of energy it carries at each wavelength using a function called the Spectral Power Distribution or SPD for short.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, below is the SPD for D65, a theoretical source of light standardized by The International Commission on Illumination (CIE). It represents the spectrum of average midday light in Western Europe or North America:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can compare this SPD to AM0, which is the measured solar radiation in outer space before entering Earth's atmosphere. Notice the absence of a dip in the ultraviolet range:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is the SPD of a typical tungsten incandescent light:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SPD shows us how much of each "color" a light is composed of. Another interesting function we can look at is called the spectral reflectance curve, which shows the fraction of incident light reflected by an object at each wavelength, effectivly representing the color of said object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going back to our apple example, since it reflects most of its light in the red wavelength, its spectral reflectance curve might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The light we see is the combination of the light spectral power distribution with the object spectral reflectance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we shine a light on our red apple, depending on the wavelengths of the light, the final color we see changes. A makes the apple appear red, because it's like multiplying the apple's color by one. We get the same result with a , because the apple reflects mostly in the red spectrum.&lt;lb/&gt;However if we shine a , besides the leaf, the rest of the apple doesn't reflect any light, thus appearing black.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the top right you can see the SPD of the flashlight, under it the reflectance curve of the apple, and the resulting reflected light below it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we now add a banana and shine a , we can obviously tell the apple and the banana apart, one being red while the other is yellow.&lt;lb/&gt;But what happens when the light is ? Both objects appear reddish to our eyes, because the banana doesn't have any green light to reflect, making it lose its yellow color. This phenomenon is called metamerism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can display the or the :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are different types of metamerism, depending on when it happens during the light transport process. The apple and banana example is called illuminant metamerism, where objects that reflect light differently appear the same under some specific illumination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observer metamerism is when objects appear different between observers, a good example of this is colorblindness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rendering equation gives us the light reflected towards a direction at a point by summing all the incoming lights at that point coming from direction in the hemisphere , weighted by the BRDF at that point and the cosine term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's peel off this equation step by step, starting with the easiest part:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a beam of light hits a surface, the area it touches is inversly proportional to the cosine of the angle of incidence. When the angle of incidence is , the area is at minimum and the intensity is concentrated, but the more the angle gets, the larger the area and the intensity gets spread out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BRDF is arguably the most important part of the rendering equation, it characterizes the surface of our material and its appearance. This is where the we can apply the microfacet theory and energy conservation to make our rendering model physically based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It takes as input the incoming and outgoing light direction, and the roughness of the surface . It equals the diffuse and the specular components weighted by their respective coefficients and .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many different BRDFs, the most common in realtime rendering is the Cook-Torrance specular microfacet model combined with Lambertian diffuse model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lambertian diffuse component is the diffuse color, called albedo, multiplied by the cosine factor. But since we already have the cosine factor in the rendering equation, the diffuse equation becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Cook-Torrance specular component itself has three components: the normal distribution function , the geometric function and the Fresnel equation .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The normal distribution function is an approximation of the number of microfacets oriented in such a way that they will reflect light from the incoming direction to the outgoing direction .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one we will use is the Trowbridge-Reitz GGX function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is the halfway vector between the incoming and outgoing directions, we calculate it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some incoming rays get occluded by some microfacets before they get a chance to bounce off to the outgoing direction, this is called shadowing. Other rays get occluded by microfacets on their way to the outgoing direction, this is called masking. The geometric function approximates this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we can see the shadowed rays in red and the masked rays in blue. The yellow rays succesfully reflected to the outgoing direction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will use the Schlick-GGX geometric function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like we discussed in the previous chapter, we will use the Fresnel-Schlick approximation which is fast for realtime rendering and accurate enough:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can combine the diffuse and specular components to get our final PBR render:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a grid of spheres with different roughness and metallic values on each axis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually the metallic values is either 0 or 1, but it is useful in PBR rendering to consider intermediate values to smoothly interpolate between metals and non-metals. Take this rusted metal material for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Physically based rendering is a very vast topic and there is a lot more to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the chapter about the physics of light, I omitted the quantum explanation of light's behaviour using probability amplitudes. We didn't talk about the double slit experiment or the wave-particle duality. I may cover this in the future when I learn more about it, for now I'll leave you with this quote from Richard Feynman's QED book:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees fully with experiment. So I hope you accept Nature as She is — absurd.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We didn't talk about polarization and assumed all our light sources are unpolarized, this isn't very important for general rendering but can be useful for research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We focused on surface rendering, in the future I will cover volume rendering, subsurface scattering, effects like optical dispersion, thin-film interference/iridescence...etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot more implementation specific details. Whether we are implementing PBR in raytracing or rasterization, we need to use optimization techniques to make the rendering faster while still being accurate. Examples that come to mind are prefiltred envmaps and importance sampling (or efficient sampling in general).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is mainly based on this SIGGRAPH talk by Naty Hoffman and Physically Based Rendering: From Theory To Implementation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main inspiration for writing interactive articles is this fantastic blog by Bartosz Ciechanowski. A lot of interactive demos in this article are similar to the ones in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other resources include LearnOpenGL, the ScienceClic youtube channel, and 3Blue1Brown of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't recommend enough the famous book QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter by Richard Feynman.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Vijaye Raji to become CTO of Applications with acquisition of Statsig&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re expanding our Applications leadership, the org responsible for how our research reaches and benefits the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we scale ChatGPT and build new applications to serve hundreds of millions of people and businesses around the world, our ambition is to push the frontier of AI research and turn it into intuitive, safe, and useful tools that people love. That takes strong engineering systems, fast iteration, and a long-term focus on quality and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vijaye Raji will step into a new role as CTO of Applications, reporting to Fidji Simo, following the acquisition of Statsig. As a hands-on builder and trusted leader, Vijaye will head product engineering for ChatGPT and Codex, with responsibilities that span core systems and product lines including infrastructure and Integrity. His experience as founder and CEO of Statsig, and a decade leading large-scale consumer engineering at Meta, brings both entrepreneurial vision and operating expertise to scale our next generation of products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Vijaye has a remarkable record of building new consumer and B2B products and systems at scale. He’s joining at a time when our models are opening entirely new ways to build, and his leadership will help turn that progress into safe applications that empower people with many new tools to improve their lives, help companies increase their impact and allow developers to build faster and better products.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—Fidji Simo, CEO of Applications, OpenAI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of this transition, we’re acquiring Statsig, one of the most trusted experimentation platforms in the industry—powering A/B testing, feature flagging, and real-time decisioning for some of the world’s most innovative companies, including OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vijaye and his team founded Statsig on the belief that the best products come from rapid experimentation, tight feedback loops, and data-informed decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Statsig platform has already played a central role in how we ship and learn quickly. Bringing it in-house will strengthen our ability to accelerate experimentation across our Applications org and build even better, more responsive experiences for the people and businesses we serve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Joining OpenAI as CTO of Applications is an extraordinary opportunity to bring my experience scaling consumer and enterprise products to a mission I deeply believe in: advancing AI in ways that are capable of solving hard problems, reliable, and truly beneficial to people everywhere. The journey with Statsig has been deeply gratifying, leading me to this moment and giving me conviction that we will continue helping teams ship better software every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—Vijaye Raji, incoming CTO of Applications, OpenAI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the acquisition is finalized, Statsig employees will become OpenAI employees. It will continue operating independently and serving its customer base out of its Seattle office. We’ll take a measured approach to any future integration, ensuring continuity for current customers and enabling the team to stay focused on what they do best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This started as an internal Sanity workshop where I demoed how I actually use AI. Spoiler: it's running multiple agents like a small team with daily amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vincent Quigley&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vincent Quigley is a Staff Software Engineer at Sanity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until 18 months ago, I wrote every line of code myself. Today, AI writes 80% of my initial implementations while I focus on architecture, review, and steering multiple development threads simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't another "AI will change everything" post. This is about the messy reality of integrating AI into production development workflows: what actually works, what wastes your time, and why treating AI like a "junior developer who doesn't learn" became my mental model for success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backstory: We run monthly engineering workshops at Sanity where someone presents what they've been experimenting with. Last time was my turn, and I showed how I'd been using Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog post is from my presentation at our internal workshop (10-min recording below).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My approach to solving code problems has pivoted four times in my career:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first 5 years, I was reading books and SDK documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then 12 years of googling for crowd-sourced answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was 18 months of using Cursor for AI-assisted coding&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And recently, 6 weeks of using Claude Code for full AI delegation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each transition happened faster than the last. The shift to Claude Code? That took just hours of use for me to become productive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what my workflow looks like now, stripped of the hype. I use AI mostly "to think with" as I'm working with it towards the code that ends up in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forget the promise of one-shot perfect code generation. Your job as an engineer is to find the best solution for the problem, not just write a bunch of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you take the learnings from this attempt and feed it back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't failure; it's the process! Expecting perfection on attempt one is like expecting a junior developer to nail a complex feature without context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge? AI can't retain learning between sessions (unless you spend the time manually giving it the "memories"). So typically, every conversation starts fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a project-specific context file with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to MCP integrations, I can now connect my AI to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without this context, you're explaining the same constraints repeatedly. With it, you start at attempt two instead of attempt one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run multiple Claude instances in parallel now, it's like managing a small team of developers who reset their memory each morning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing code is one part of the job, but so is reviewing code. Adopting AI has evolved my code review process as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This saves me and my peers time and extra rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Sanity, our policy is that the engineer is responsible for the code they ship, even if it's AI generated. I want to make sure that I ship:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key take away: I'm more critical of "my code" now because I didn't type out a lot of it. No emotional attachment means better reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're testing Slack-triggered agents using Cursor for simple tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the potential? Imagine agents handling your backlog's small tickets while you sleep. We're actively exploring this at Sanity, sharing learnings across teams as we figure out what works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's talk money. My Claude Code usage costs my company not an insignificant percent of what they pay me monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for that investment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ROI is obvious, but budget for $1000-1500/month for a senior engineer going all-in on AI development. It's also reasonable to expect engineers to get more efficient with AI spend as they get good with it, but give them time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everything in AI-assisted development is smooth. Here are the persistent challenges I find myself in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The learning problem&lt;lb/&gt;AI doesn't learn from mistakes. You fix the same misunderstandings repeatedly. Your solution: better documentation and more explicit instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The confidence problem&lt;lb/&gt;AI confidently writes broken code claiming that it's great. Always verify, especially for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The context limit problem&lt;lb/&gt;Large codebases overwhelm AI context windows. Break problems into smaller chunks and provide focused context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardest part? Letting go of code ownership. But now I don't care about "my code" anymore; it's just output to review and refine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This detachment is actually quite liberating!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a better AI tool appears tomorrow, I'll switch immediately. The code isn't precious; the problems we solve are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I were to give advice from an engineer's perspective, if you're a technical leader considering AI adoption:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineers who adapt to the new AI workflows will find themselves with a new sharp knife in their toolbox: They're becoming orchestrators, handling multiple AI agents while focusing on architecture, review, and complex problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pick one small, well-defined feature. Give AI three attempts at implementing it. Review the output like you're mentoring a junior developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it. No huge transformation needed, no process overhaul required. Just one feature, three attempts, and a honest review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about developers working faster, creating better solutions, and leveraging the best tools available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Making a Linux home server sleep on idle and wake on demand â the simple way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It began with what seemed like a final mundane touch to my home server setup for hosting Time Machine backups: I wanted it to automatically sleep when idle and wake up again when needed. You know, sleep on idle â hasnât Windows had that built in since like Windows 98? How hard could it be to configure on a modern Ubuntu install?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, I wanted more than just sleep on idle, I also wanted wake on request â and that second bit turns out to be the hard part. There were a bunch of dead ends, but I stuck out it to find something that âjust worksâ without the need to manually turn on the server for every backup. Join me on the full adventure further down, or cut to the chase with the setup instructions below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;tl;dr&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Outcome:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Server automatically suspends to RAM when idle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Server automatically wakes when needed by anything else on the network, including SSH, Time Machine backups, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Youâll need:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An always-on Linux device on the same network as your server, e.g. a Raspberry Pi&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A network interface device for your server that supports wake-on-LAN with unicast packets&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;On the server:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable wake-on-LAN with unicast packets (not just magic packets), make it persistent&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Caveats&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The serverâs network device needs to support wake-on-LAN from unicast packets&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To prevent unwanted wake-ups, youâll need to ensure no device on the network is sending extraneous packets to the server&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I got there&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a bit about my hardware, as this solution is somewhat hardware-dependent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HP ProDesk 600 G3 SFF&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU: Intel Core i5-7500&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Network adapter: Intel I219-LM&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sleeping on idle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started with sleep-on-idle, which boiled down to two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to determine if the server is idle or busy at any given moment&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to automatically suspend to RAM after being idle for some time&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the guides I found for sleep-on-idle, like this one, were for Ubuntu Desktop â sleep-on-idle doesnât seem to be something thatâs commonly done with Ubuntu Server. I came across a few tools that looked promising, the most notable being &lt;code&gt;circadian&lt;/code&gt;. In general, though, there didnât seem to be a standard/best-practice way to do it, so I decided Iâd roll it myself the simplest way I could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Determining idle/busy state&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked myself what server activity would constitute being busy, and landed on two things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logged in SSH sessions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In-progress Time Machine backups&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choosing corresponding metrics was pretty straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Count of logged in users, using &lt;code&gt;who&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Count of connections on the AFP port (548), using &lt;code&gt;lsof&lt;/code&gt;(Iâm using AFP for Time Machine network shares)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For both metrics, I noted the values first at idle, and then again when the server was busy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Automatically suspending to RAM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, I opted for a cron job that triggers a bash script â check out the final version shared above. So far itâs worked fine; if I ever need to account for more metrics in detecting idle state, Iâll consider using a more sophisticated option like &lt;code&gt;circadian&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Waking on request&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With sleep-on-idle out of the way, I moved on to figuring out how the server would wake on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could the machine be configured to automatically wake upon receiving a network request? I knew Wake-on-LAN supported waking a computer up using a specially crafted âmagic packetâ, and it was straightforward to get this working. The question was if a regular, non-âmagic packetâ could somehow do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wake on PHY?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some online searching yielded a superuser discussion that looked particularly promising. It pointed to the man page for ethtool, the Linux utility used to configure network hardware. It shared ethtoolâs complete wake-on-LAN configuration options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;wol p|u|m|b|a|g|s|f|d...
      Sets Wake-on-LAN options.  Not all devices support
      this.  The argument to this option is a string of
      characters specifying which options to enable.

      p   Wake on PHY activity
      u   Wake on unicast messages
      m   Wake on multicast messages
      b   Wake on broadcast messages
      a   Wake on ARP
      g   Wake on MagicPacketâ¢
      s   Enable SecureOnâ¢ password for MagicPacketâ¢
      f   Wake on filter(s)
      d   Disable (wake on nothing).  This option
          clears all previous options.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It pointed in particular to the &lt;code&gt;Wake on PHY activity&lt;/code&gt; option, which seemed perfect for this use-case. It seemed to mean that any packet sent to the network interfaceâs MAC address would wake it. I enabled the flag using &lt;code&gt;ethtool&lt;/code&gt;, manually put the machine to sleep, then tried logging back in using SSH and sending pings. No dice: the machine remained asleep despite multiple attempts. So much for that ð&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Breakthrough: wake on unicast&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of &lt;code&gt;ethtool&lt;/code&gt;âs other wake-on-LAN options seemed relevant, but some more searching pointed to the &lt;code&gt;Wake on unicast messages&lt;/code&gt; as another option to try. I enabled the flag using &lt;code&gt;ethtool&lt;/code&gt;, manually put the machine to sleep, then tried logging back in using SSH. Bingo! This time, the machine woke up. ð With that, I figured I was done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not so fast â there were two problems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sometimes, the server would wake up without any network activity that I knew of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some period of time after the server went to sleep, it would become impossible to wake it again using network activity other than a magic packet&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A closer look at the same superuser discussion above revealed exactly the reason for the second problem: shortly after going to sleep, the machine was effectively disappearing from the network because it was no longer responding to ARP requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ARP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the cached ARP entry for other machines on the network was expiring, meaning that they had no way to resolve the serverâs IP address to its MAC address. In other words, an attempt to ping my server at &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.2&lt;/code&gt; was failing to even send a packet to the server, because the serverâs MAC address wasnât known. Without a packet being sent, there was no way that server was going to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Static ARP?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first reaction: letâs manually create ARP cache entries on each network client. This is indeed possible on macOS using:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo arp -s [IP address] [MAC address]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it also didnât meet the goal of having things âjust workâ: I was not interested in creating static ARP cache entries on each machine that would be accessing the server. On to other options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;ARP protocol offload?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some more searching revealed something interesting: this problem had already been solved long ago in the Windows world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was called ARP protocol offload, and it goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The network hardware is capable of responding to ARP requests independently of the CPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Before going to sleep, the OS configures the network hardware to respond to ARP requests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;While sleeping, the network hardware responds to ARP requests on its own, without waking the rest of the machine to use the CPU&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voila, this was exactly what I needed. I even looked at the datasheet for my network hardware, which lists ARP Offload as a feature on the front page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only problem? No Linux support. I searched the far reaches of the internet, then finally dug into the Linux driver source code to find that ARP offload isnât supported by the Linux driver. This was when I briefly pondered trying to patch the driver to add ARP offloadâ¦ before reminding myself that successfully patching Linux driver code is far beyond what I could hope to achieve in a little free-time project like this one. (Though maybe one dayâ¦)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Other solutions using magic packets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some more searching led me to some other clever and elaborate solutions involving magic packets. The basic idea was to automate sending magic packets. One solution (wake-on-arp) listens for ARP requests to a specified host to trigger sending a magic packet to that host. Another solution implements a web interface and Home Assistant integration to enable triggering a magic packet from a smartphone web browser. These are impressive, but I wanted something simpler that didnât require manually waking up the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I considered a few other options, but abandoned them because they felt too complex and prone to breaking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Writing a script to send a magic packet and then immediately trigger a Time Machine backup using &lt;code&gt;tmutil&lt;/code&gt;. The script would need to be manually installed and scheduled to run periodically on each Mac.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using HAProxy to proxy all relevant network traffic through the Raspberry Pi and using a hook to send a magic packet to the server on activity.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Breakthrough: ARP Stand-in&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I was attempting didnât seem much different from the static IP mapping thatâs routinely configured on home routers, except that it was for DHCP instead of ARP. Was there no way to make my router do the same thing for ARP?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some more digging into the ARP protocol revealed that ARP resolution doesnât even require a specific, authoritative host to answer requests â any other network device can respond to ARP requests. In other words, my router didnât need to be the one resolving ARP requests, it could be anything. Now how could I just set up something to respond on behalf of the sleeping server?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs what I was trying to do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought it must be possible to implement as a Linux network configuration, but the closest thing I found was Proxy ARP, which accomplished a different goal. So I went one level deeper, to network programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, how to go about listening for ARP request packets? This is apparently possible to do using a raw socket, but I also knew that &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; and Wireshark were capable of using filters to capture only packets of a given type. That led me to look into libpcap, the library that powers both of those tools. I learned that using &lt;code&gt;libpcap&lt;/code&gt; had a clear advantage over a raw socket: &lt;code&gt;libpcap&lt;/code&gt; implements very efficient filtering directly in the kernel, whereas a raw socket would require manual packet filtering in user space, which is less performant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aiming to keep things simple, I decided to try writing the solution in Ruby, which led me to the pcaprub Ruby bindings for &lt;code&gt;libpcap&lt;/code&gt;. From there, I just needed to figure out what filter to use with &lt;code&gt;libpcap&lt;/code&gt;. Some research and trial/error yielded this filter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arp and arp[6:2] == 1 and arp[24:4] == [IP address converted to hex]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, using a target IP address of &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.2&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arp and arp[6:2] == 1 and arp[24:4] == 0xc0a80102
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Letâs break this down, using the ARP packet structure definition for byte offets and lengths:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;arp&lt;/code&gt;â ARP packets&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;arp[6:2] == 1&lt;/code&gt;â ARP request packets.&lt;code&gt;[6:2]&lt;/code&gt;means âthe 2 bytes found at byte offset 6â.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;arp[24:4] == [IP address converted to hex]&lt;/code&gt;â ARP packets with the specified target address.&lt;code&gt;[24:4]&lt;/code&gt;means âthe 4 bytes found at byte offset 24â.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest is pretty straightforward and the whole solution comes out to only ~50 lines of Ruby code. In short, &lt;code&gt;arp_standin&lt;/code&gt; is a daemon that does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starts up, taking these configuration options: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;IP and MAC address of the machine itâs standing in for (the âtargetâ)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Network interface to operate on&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Listens for ARP requests for the targetâs IP address&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On detecting an ARP request for the targetâs IP address, responds with the targetâs MAC address&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the serverâs IP â MAC address mapping is defined statically through the &lt;code&gt;arp_standin&lt;/code&gt; daemonâs configuration, it doesnât matter if the Raspberry Piâs ARP cache entry for the server is expired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the link below to install it or explore the source code further:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;danielpgross/arp_standin on GitHub&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ARP is used in IPv4 and is replaced by Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) in IPv6. I donât have any need for IPv6 right now, so I disabled IPv6 entirely on the server using the steps shown above. It should be possible to add support for Neighbor Discovery to the ARP-Standin service as a future enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the new service running on my Raspberry Pi, I used Wireshark to confirm that ARP requests being sent to the server were triggering responses from the ARP Stand-in. It worked ð â things were looking promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting it all working&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big pieces were in place:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the server went to sleep after becoming idle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the server could wake up from unicast packets&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;other machines could resolve the serverâs MAC address using ARP, long after it went to sleep&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the ARP Stand-in running, I turned on the server and ran a backup from my computer. When the backup was finished, the server went to sleep automatically. But there was a problem: the server was waking up immediately after going to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unwanted wake-ups&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First thing I checked was the Linux system logs, but these didnât prove too helpful, since they didnât show what network packet actually triggered the wakeup. Wireshark/tcpdump were no help here either, because they wouldnât be running when the computer was sleeping. Thatâs when I thought to use port mirroring: capturing packets from an intermediary device between the server and the rest of the network. After a brief, unsuccessful attempt to repurpose an extra router running OpenWRT, a search for the least expensive network switch with port mirroring support yielded the TP-Link TL-SG105E for ~$30.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the switch connected and port mirroring enabled, I started capturing with Wireshark and the culprits immediately became clear:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My Mac, which was configured to use the server as a Time Machine backup host using AFP, was sending AFP packets to the server after it had gone to sleep&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My Netgear R7000, acting as a wireless access point, was sending frequent, unsolicited NetBIOS &lt;code&gt;NBTSTAT&lt;/code&gt;queries to the server&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Eliminating AFP packets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had a hunch about why the Mac was sending these packets:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Mac mounted the AFP share to perform a Time Machine backup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Time Machine backup finished, but the share remained mounted&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Mac was checking on the status of the share periodically, as would be done normally for a mounted network share&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also had a corresponding hunch that the solution would be to make sure the share got unmounted before the server went to sleep, so that the Mac would no longer ping the server for its status afterwards. I figured that shutting down the AFP service would trigger unmounting of shares on all its clients, achieving the goal. Now I just needed to ensure the service would shut down when the server was going to sleep, then start again when it woke back up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; supports exactly that, and relatively easily â I defined a dedicated &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; service to hook into sleep/wake events (check out the configuration shared above). A Wireshark capture confirmed that it did the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Eliminating NetBIOS packets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one proved to be harder, because the packets were unsolicited â they seemed random and unrelated to any activity being done by the server. I thought they might be related to Samba services running on the server, but the packets persisted even after I completely removed Samba from the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why was my network router sending NetBIOS requests, anyway? Turns out that Netgear routers have a feature called ReadySHARE for sharing USB devices over the network using the SMB protocol. Presumably, the router firmware uses Samba behind the scenes, which uses NetBIOS queries to build and maintain its own representation of NetBIOS hosts on the network. Easy â turn off ReadySHARE, right? Nope, thereâs no way to do that in Netgearâs stock firmware ð.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That led me to take the plunge and flash the router with open-source FreshTomato firmware. Iâm glad I did, because the firmware is much better than the stock one anyway, and it immediately stopped the unwanted NetBIOS packets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Time Machine not triggering wake-up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was getting close now: the server remained asleep, and I could reliably wake it up by logging in with SSH, even long after it went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was great, but one thing wasnât working: when starting a backup on my Mac, Time Machine would show a loading state indefinitely with &lt;code&gt;Connecting to backup disk...&lt;/code&gt; and eventually give up. Was the server failing to wake up from packets the Mac was sending, or was the Mac not sending packets at all?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A port-mirrored Wireshark capture answered that question: the Mac wasnât sending any packets to the server, even long after it started to say &lt;code&gt;Connecting to backup disk...&lt;/code&gt;. Digging into the macOS Time Machine logs with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;log show --style syslog --predicate 'senderImagePath contains[cd] "TimeMachine"' --info
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few entries made it clear:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine:Mounting] Attempting to mount 'afp://backup_mbp@homeserver._afpovertcp._tcp.local./tm_mbp'
...
(TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine:General] Failed to resolve CFNetServiceRef with name = homeserver type = _afpovertcp._tcp. domain = local.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mac was using mDNS (a.k.a. Bonjour, Zeroconf) to resolve the backup serverâs IP address using its hostname. The server was asleep and therefore not responding to the requests, so the Mac was failing to resolve its IP address. This explained why the Mac wasnât sending any packets to the server, leaving it asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;mDNS stand-in&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I already had an ARP stand-in service, now I needed my Raspberry Pi to also respond to mDNS queries for the server while it slept. I knew that Avahi was one of the main mDNS implementations for Linux. I first tried these instructions using &lt;code&gt;.service&lt;/code&gt; files to configure my Raspberry Pi to respond to mDNS queries on behalf of the server. I used the following on the Mac to check the result:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dns-sd -L homeserver _afpovertcp._tcp local
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason, that approach just didnât work; Avahi didnât respond on behalf of the server. I experimented instead with &lt;code&gt;avahi-publish&lt;/code&gt; (man page), which (to my pleasant surprise) worked right away using the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;avahi-publish -s homeserver _afpovertcp._tcp 548 -H homeserver.local
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that, I just needed to create a &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; service definition that would automatically run the &lt;code&gt;avahi-publish&lt;/code&gt; command on boot (check out the configuration shared above).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ð Finish&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all the wrinkles ironed out, everything has been working well now for over a month. I hope youâve enjoyed following along and that this approach works for you too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alphabet shares popped 8% in extended trading as investors celebrated what they viewed as minimal consequences from a historic defeat last year in the landmark antitrust case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Department of Justice, including the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser, which provides data that helps its advertising business deliver targeted ads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment," the decision stated. "Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divestiture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mehta, who oversaw the remedies trial in May, ordered the parties to meet by Sept. 10 for the final judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and held a monopoly in search and related advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The antitrust trial started in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals," Google said in a blog post. "We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the key areas of focus was the exclusive contracts Google held for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his decision Tuesday, Mehta said the company can make payments to preload products, but it cannot have exclusive contracts that condition payments or licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOJ had asked Google to stop the practice of "compelled syndication," which refers to the practice of making certain deals with companies to ensure its search engine remains the default choice in browsers and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The court's ruling today recognizes the need for remedies that will pry open the market for general search services, which has been frozen in place for over a decade," the DOJ said in a press release. "The ruling also recognizes the need to prevent Google from using the same anticompetitive tactics for its GenAI products as it used to monopolize the search market, and the remedies will reach GenAI technologies and companies."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google pays Apple billions of dollars per year to be the default search engine on iPhones. It's lucrative for Apple and a valuable way for Google to get more search volume and users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple stock rose 4% on Tuesday after hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Google will not be barred from making payments or offering other consideration to distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google Search, Chrome, or its GenAI products. Cutting off payments from Google almost certainly will impose substantial—in some cases, crippling—downstream harms to distribution partners, related markets, and consumers, which counsels against a broad payment ban."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google was also ordered to loosen its hold on search data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the remedies trial in May, the DOJ asked the judge to force Google to share the data it uses for generating search results, such as data about what users click on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mehta ruled Tuesday that Google will have to make available certain search index data and user interaction data, though "not ads data."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google does not have to share or provide access to granular data with advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The court narrowed the datasets Google will be required to share and said they must occur on "ordinary commercial terms that are consistent with Google's current syndication services."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;This blog is running on a recycled Google Pixel 5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you glance over this blog, you will see that I am an avid Android fan. After setting up numerous Linux &lt;code&gt;proot&lt;/code&gt; desktops on phones, I wanted to see if I use a phone as a server and run my blog from an Android phone. Since you are reading this, I was successful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was inspired my a few Mastodon posts earlier this week to give it a go. First, I stumbled on a post from @kaimac who is running a site from an ESP32 microcontroller. In the comments of that post, I saw a mention to compost.party created by user @computersandblues that runs completely on an Android device and a solar panel. Last, @stevelord who is essentially running a homelab on a TP-Link router with OpenWRT installed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a lot about power consumption of my homelab and I also love using old hardware for random projects to give them new life. I was truly inspired by the above works, so I got right down to business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The hardware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked through the devices I had laying around and I chose a Google Pixel 5 my brother-in-law gave me after he upgraded. The Pixel 5 is carrier locked to Verizon, which is notorious for making it impossible to also unlock the bootloader and install custom ROMs. At first I wanted a device that I could install PostmarketOS to run a proper Linux server. In the end, I’m glad I didn’t go that route.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another reason I chose the Pixel 5 is because it supports USB-OTG and can use docks with hard-wired internet. I didn’t want to run the site on wifi and having an ethernet connection was mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last, it is the most current phone I have. This device is open to the internet, so I wanted to make sure it is an updated as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Solar powered blog!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This summer I’ve been testing using a 100w solar panel I got from Harbor Freight Tools so I can learn more about how it all works before diving into larger projects. I have that panel connected to a Jackery 160w power station to keep it charged up and we use it to charge our mobile devices. I got the Jackery last year as a power bank I use while on jobsites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I already have this set up, I am now using it to power this blog. I’m happy with this setup as I’ve been getting more into permacomputing. Having a website that is fully offgrid using recycled parts is exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I used to create the site (Termux is the GOAT)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While considering what projects I could do with this phone, I was thinking I was going to install a &lt;code&gt;proot&lt;/code&gt; desktop and then run from within a Linux environment. Before I started I decided to check out a few packages that are in Termux (the flat out amazing terminal emulator) to see how far I could push it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I checked for some basics and read about setting up an &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; connection. Then I randomly searched for Hugo, which is what my blog was already built on. Sure enough, it is right there in the Termux repos! Turns out, it has been in there for a long time. I see a lot of posts from 2018 with people using it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How has it been going&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great! Site is fast and reliable. I ran into a few hiccups on the first day or so, which were mostly around the version of Hugo on my server and the newer version I am using on the phone. The other is related to my solar setup and keeping an eye on the battery levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don’t think anyone can tell it is running on an Android phone instead of a x86 Linux box or a hyperscaler VPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the moment I have no plans to change this setup and will leave it as-is until some issue arises. But, there’s really not much to report other than it works fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are my longform notes on how I set it up. But, the short version is it was way simpler than I thought it would be. You can get up and running with a Hugo site by just installing &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt;, your favorite text editor, and &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; straight from the repos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not included in this post is how I add new posts to the phone. I can use &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; to send a files, but I prefer to use dufs that is a static file server in that can be accessed in the browser. Using &lt;code&gt;dufs&lt;/code&gt; I can upload files and make quick edits straight in the browser from any device. Surprise! &lt;code&gt;dufs&lt;/code&gt; is also in the Termux repos and is so easy to get up and running. Again, message me if you’d like to see a write-up about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course I need some basic utilities. These are the utilities I need to have at a minimum when working with a Linux system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;rsync&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;openssh&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;git&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;wget&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;curl&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;fish shell&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;cronie&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;termux-services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;iperf3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;speedtest-go&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;screen&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;helix&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hugo&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restart Termux and use &lt;code&gt;sv-enable&lt;/code&gt; to run certain items as services. I do this for &lt;code&gt;sshd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cronie&lt;/code&gt;. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ sv-enable sshd
$ sv-enable cronie
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After running &lt;code&gt;sv-enable&lt;/code&gt;, restart Termux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;openssh&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could build all of this straight from the phone using either the touchscreen keyboard or connecting a standard keyboard and mouse either with a USB-C dock or bluetooth. But, I want to manage this like all of my other servers, which is to &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; into the device and work from my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an official guide for setting up an &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; server. All I will add here is some pointers I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adding an &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;key is simple and should be one of the first steps done. After generating the key and importing with&lt;code&gt;ssh-copy-id&lt;/code&gt;from the desktop, edit the&lt;code&gt;sshd&lt;/code&gt;file in&lt;code&gt;$PREFIX/etc/ssh/sshd_config&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Termux generates its own username and cannot be changed. Run &lt;code&gt;whoami&lt;/code&gt;to see what it is.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is the same for the &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;port. As far as I can tell you cannot change the port, which is automatically set to 8022.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Running the site&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of guides out there on how to setup a &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; site. I have an existing site that I migrated from a VM to this phone, so my notes do not include how to get a &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; site running. I also do not need to do any port forwarding as I already have a reverse proxy that I just changed where it points for my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would like to hear feedback if there is a need to add those notes here. Message me on Mastodon or by email using the links at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are notes on how I use the package &lt;code&gt;cronie&lt;/code&gt; to start the blog using &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; and the automatically reload the blog occasionally. &lt;code&gt;cronie&lt;/code&gt; is for setting up &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; tasks. Once installed and enabled, run &lt;code&gt;crontab -e&lt;/code&gt; like usual to setup tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how I do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, set a &lt;code&gt;fish&lt;/code&gt; alias for the command to reload the blog:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;alias blog_run='cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/&amp;lt;website_root_dir&amp;gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/hugo serve --bind=0.0.0.0 --baseURL=https://blog.ctms.me --appendPort=false --environment=production --disableFastRender --cacheDir /data/data/com.termux/files/home/&amp;lt;website_root_dir&amp;gt;/cache'

funcsave blog_run
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, create a script and place in &lt;code&gt;~/scripts&lt;/code&gt; that closes a previous instance of &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt;, clears the cache, and then starts a new &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; session titled “hugo” and execute the alias:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#! /bin/bash
screen -X -S "hugo" quit
rm -rf /data/data/com.termux/files/home/&amp;lt;website_root_dir/cache/&amp;lt;site_name_dir&amp;gt;/filecache/getresource/
screen -S hugo -d -m fish -c 'blog_run; exec fish'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last, set it to run with &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;*/5 * * * * cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/scripts &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sh blog_reload.sh
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Backing up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Termux supports &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; connections, I can use it on remote machines to pull the files from the phone using &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, need to install &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; on the phone with &lt;code&gt;pkg install rsync&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Desktop backup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can run it from my desktop to pull the files:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;rsync -aP pixel:~/&amp;lt;website_root_dir&amp;gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog/
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On my desktop, I have this for &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@reboot sleep 30 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rsync -aP pixel:~/&amp;lt;website_root_dir&amp;gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog/ &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $HOME/logs/pixel-hugo-backup.log 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;nas backup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the same configuration. The only difference is the backup location and the &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;rsync -aP pixel:~/&amp;lt;website_root_dir&amp;gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The automation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;5 6 * * * rsync -aP pixel:~/&amp;lt;website_root_dir&amp;gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $HOME/logs/pixel-hugo-backup.log 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;git backup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a local self-hosted git instance I push backups to, but you can totally set it up to send them to Github or whatever forge you use. No instructions here because there are plenty of guides out there on how to set this up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deal with a lot of servers at work, and one thing everyone wants to know about their servers is how close they are to being at max utilization. It should be easy, right? Just pull up &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; or another system monitor tool, look at network, memory and CPU utilization, and whichever one is the highest tells you how close you are to the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, whenever people actually try to project these numbers, they find that CPU utilization doesn't quite increase linearly. But how bad could it possibly be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer this question, I ran a bunch of stress tests and monitored both how much work they did and what the system-reported CPU utilization was, then graphed the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my test machine, I used a desktop computer running Ubuntu with a Ryzen 9 5900X (12 core / 24 thread) processor. I also enabled Precision Boost Overdrive (i.e. Turbo).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I vibe-coded a script that runs stress-ng in a loop, first using 24 workers and attempting to run them each at different utilizations from 1% to 100%, then using 1 to 24 workers all at 100% utilization. It used different stress testing method and measured the number of operations that could be completed ("Bogo ops1").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason I did two different methods was that operating systems are smart about how they schedule work, and scheduling a small number of workers at 100% utilization can be done optimally (spoilers) but with 24 workers all at 50% utilization it's hard for the OS to do anything other than spreading the work evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see the raw CSV results here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;General CPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most basic test just runs all of stress-ng's CPU stress tests in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see that when the system is reporting 50% CPU utilization, it's actually doing 60-65% of the actual maximum work it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;64-bit Integer Math&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But maybe that one was just a fluke. What if we just run some random math on 64-bit integers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is even worse! At "50% utilization", we're actually doing 65-85% of the max work we can get done. It can't possibly get worse than that though, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Matrix Math&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something is definitely off. Doing matrix math, "50% utilization" is actually 80% to 100% of the max work that can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering about the system monitor screenshot from the start of the article, that was a matrix math test running with 12 workers, and you can see that it really did report 50% utilization even though additional workers do absolutely nothing (except make the utilization number go up).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What's Going On?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hyperthreading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might notice that this the graph keeps changing at 50%, and I've helpfully added piecewise linear regressions showing the fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main reason this is happening is hyperthreading: Half of the "cores" on this machine (and most machines) are sharing resources with other cores. If I run 12 workers on this machine, they each get scheduled on their own physical core with no shared resources, but once I go over that, each additional worker is sharing resources with another. In some cases (general CPU benchmarks), this makes things slightly worse, and in some cases (SIMD-heavy matrix math), there are no useful resources left to share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Turbo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's harder to see, but Turbo is also having an effect. This particular processor runs at 4.9 GHz at low utilization, but slowly drops to 4.3 GHz as more cores become active2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the zoomed-in y-axis. The clock speed "only" drops by 15% on this processor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since CPU utilization is calculated as busy cycles / total cycles, this means the denominator is getting smaller as the numerator gets larger, so we get yet another reason why actual CPU utilization increases faster than linearly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Does This Matter?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at CPU utilization and assume it will increase linearly, you're going to have a rough time. If you're using the CPU efficiently (running above "50%" utilization), the reported utilization is an underestimate, sometimes significantly so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And keep in mind that I've only shown results for one processor, but hyperthreading performance and Turbo behavior can vary wildly between different processors, especially from different companies (AMD vs Intel).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best way I know to work around this is to run benchmarks and monitor actual work done:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Benchmark how much work your server can do before having errors or unacceptable latency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Report how much work your server is currently doing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compare those two metrics instead of CPU utilization.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bogo ops is presumably a reference to BogoMIPS, a "bogus" benchmark that Linux does at startup to very roughly understand CPU performance.Â â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One of the main constraints processors operate under is needing to dissipate heat fast enough. When only one core is running, the processor can give that core some of the heat headroom that other cores aren't using and run it faster, but it can't do that all of the cores are running.Power usage works similarly and can be a constraint in some environments (usually not in a desktop computer, but frequently in servers).Â â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Tortured-Metaphor/LightCycle.git
cd LightCycle

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the game
cargo run --release&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate your light cycle around the arena, leaving a trail behind you. Avoid crashing into walls, your own trail, or your opponent's trail. The last cycle standing wins!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use your boost strategically - it doubles your speed but drains energy quickly. Energy regenerates when not boosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy: Shorter reaction time, makes mistakes more often&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Medium: Balanced gameplay, moderate challenge&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hard: Advanced pathfinding, optimal decision making, aggressive boost usage&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;v0.2.0 - Added pause menu, boost mechanics, AI difficulties, visual effects&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;2025 Financial Report and Fundraiser&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;September 02, 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig Software Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which I am proud to say makes extremely efficient use of monetary resources. Unlike many of our peers, our primary expense is direct payments to contributors for their enhancements to the Zig project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donât take my word for it - letâs look at some numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2024 Expenditures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Expense Name&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2024 Cost&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Contractors&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$306,362.09&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Direct compensation to contributors working on Zig at a rate of $60/hour.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Employees&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$154,263.32&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ZSF has one employee which is yours truly, Andrew Kelley, serving the role of Lead Software Engineer. In 2024, I also volunteered my time as President of Zig Software Foundation, volunteered as Accounting Clerk, and volunteered as Development Director. In the future, it would be nice to have dedicated staff for these roles so that I could focus more on being Lead Software Engineer.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Accounting&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$18,463.62&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;This is entirely paying our accountant, Strada Financial Group, to keep the American legal system happy and keep our organization tax-exempt. I suspected we were being overcharged, and in 2025 switched to a different accountant.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CI &amp;amp; Website&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$14,986.73&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zig has great cross-compiling abilities in part due to investing in testing infrastructure for different systems. Some of these costs were one-time costs to purchase machines that sit in our homes and offices while others are market-rate Hetzner bare metal machines that we run GitHub Actions on.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Taxes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$13,089.07&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Although ZSF is a tax-exempt organization, employees are still required to pay income tax.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Travel&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$6,955.61&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;In a 2024 meeting, the board decided that the previous year's travel budget successfully helped grow Zig adoption, and retained the same budget of $15,000. In 2024, ZSF spent $6,956 of those allocated funds, increasing Zig's presence in Italy and Germany.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sponsorships&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$5,846.24&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Zig project is mostly comprised of in-house code, however, it also relies on third party projects. Today, every Zig installation includes some source files or ported code from musl libc, mingw-w64, and others. ZSF donates money to these projects as a way to say thanks, give back to the ecosystem, and increase the sustainability of Zig's dependencies.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bank Fees&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$782.23&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;This is a tiny slice of the pie, but every time ZSF wires money, there is a transaction fee. Our contractors graciously bill infrequently when possible to help reduce this cost.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Total Expenses&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$520,748.91&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with a 13% bigger budget, we still managed to spend 92% of our money in 2024 paying contributors for their time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Major Initiatives in 2024&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.13.0 Released&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.14.0 Released&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Greatly expanded support for more targets that can be correctly cross-compiled and run on.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Major language enhancements&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Major standard library enhancements&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Major build system enhancements&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Zig 0.14.1 released with bug fixes only.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far so good. You can see weâve been hard at work spending our esteemed donorsâ money on advancing the mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if we look at the trend of donations over time for the year 2024, we see overall a slow decline. This is why weâre doing another fundraiser this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2024-2025 Donations Per Month&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big spike is half of Mitchell Hashimotoâs pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More to the point, the second half will buy us another year to raise donations in order to keep our bank balance positive. ZSF neither borrows money nor invests money; we convert donations directly into progress on the Zig project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2024-2025 Cash On Hand&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, user activity continues to skyrocket. A rapidly increasing user base is adding Zig to their software stacks, filing issues, sending pull requests, asking for help, and shipping software that depends on Zig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2024 GitHub Issues Per Month&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top line is Total Issues Opened and the bottom line is Total Issues Closed. The gap is widening - more users are demanding more attention than Zig core team has time for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Average time to close issues&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;7 months&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Past Year&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Past Month&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;over 1 year&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;30 days&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In response to this rising demand, we added Alex RÃ¸nne Petersen to the Zig core team. Thanks to the income that was available to us in 2024, we were able to offer new contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2024 Income&lt;/head&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;GitHub Sponsors&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$170,656.04&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Zig on GitHub Sponsors. This category contains a numerous amount of individuals and companies - each less than $1000/month. We recommend those donating via GitHub Sponsors to switch to Every.org since they process receipts and are a non-profit organization themselves and are not in the process of neglecting their core product in the face of the AI boom.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$150,000.00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A generous individual. While his family's donation has helped ZSF immensely in 2024 and will continue to do so in 2025, neither ZSF nor Mitchell himself wants him to be this large a slice of the pie!&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Every.org&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$90,097.45&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Every.org is a fellow 501(c)(3) non-profit that manages donation collecting for other non-profits. They've been good to us; it's our preferred method of receiving donations. This category is mostly individuals along with a few small donations from companies.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;TigerBeetle is a financial transaction database with 1000x faster OLTP performance, mission critical safety, and indestructible storage fault tolerance.&lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, with our current level of recurring income, we will not be able to renew everyoneâs contracts, nor offer new contracts to Zig core team members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Plea for Donations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have extremely talented Zig core team members who want to renew their contracts, and others who are interested to start getting paid for their valuable work for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to do this, we need more recurring donations. I for one do not enjoy asking for money, but in the interest of our users and contributors, it would be irresponsible not to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please sign up for a monthly donation if you can. Our preferred donation method is via Every.org. A fellow 501(c)(3) non-profit, they seamlessly manage gift receipts, and are not pivoting to AI like GitHub is currently doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More details including our EIN and address for paper checks&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Companies&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Contact us to get your logo on ziglang.org in exchange for a monthly donation.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Employees&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Check if your company matches donations to charities such as Zig Software Foundation. That 2x multiplier makes a huge difference. We're already in the system.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Venture Capitalists&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;We are aware of a few startups betting on Zig as their language and toolchain of choice to build tomorrow's critical infrastructure. Helping the Zig Software Foundation reach v1.0 faster is one of the most efficient uses of capital you can make to boost your portfolio.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Individuals&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Can you spare $10 per month? This is our favorite kind of donation because it helps diversify ZSF's income, keeping us free from undue influence from any single party. If not, don't sweat it. We'll be OK.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to all who graciously donate funds to our cause. Together we serve the users!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Update, July 7 2023: Dave Hayden took the resin-printed typeball concept and improved on it greatly. I'm extremely grateful that he took on all the hard work of iteratively going through and dialing in the perfect values to make a functional ball, and I'm pleased to think I contributed in some way to his achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;lb/&gt;This is a Comic Sans typeball designed to work with the IBM Selectric typewriters that take 88-character type elements. More information about the 3D printed typeballs can be found at the Github repo for the project.&lt;lb/&gt;I have not yet printed and tested this exact model! I tested a previous revision which was just a bit too tall and 90Â° off; I've corrected the letter rotations and shaved 0.2 mm off the height.&lt;lb/&gt;To affix the typeball to the typewriter, you will need a small clip such as this one or a bent wire.&lt;lb/&gt;The blank ball (not the letters) is an edited version of the OpenSCAD Selectric Typeball by 1944GPW and is licensed with the Creative Commons - Attribution license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The author marked this model as their own original creation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Finnish City Inaugurates 1 MW/100 MWh Sand Battery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are more ways to store energy than just using batteries. Some are using fire bricks, particularly for process heat for industries that rely on high heat in manufacturing. Others propose an arrangement of massive concrete blocks that move up and down like the weights of a giant grandfather clock, converting kinetic energy to potential energy and back again. In Finland, two intrepid engineers began experimenting with a sand battery a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we reported when the first prototype was unveiled three years ago, the idea of a sand battery began with two Finnish engineers, Markku Ylönen and Tommi Eronen. The concept is simplicity itself. Make a really big pile of sand. Heat it with excess renewable electricity to around 500°C (932°F), then use that heat later to heat homes, factories, even swimming pools. They say the sand can stay hot for 3 months or more. The pair have founded Polar Night Energy, which constructed a prototype consisting of 100 tons of sand inside what looks like a silo in the town of Kankaanpää.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many Americans are unfamiliar with the concept of district heating, but it is widely used in other counties, especially in Scandinavia where keeping schools, municipal buildings, arenas, factories, and homes warm in winter is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loviisan Lämpö is a Finnish district heating company that supplies district heating to customers in Loviisa, Pukkila, Pornainen, and Pyhtää. It has collaborated with Polar Night on a new sand battery — one that is much larger than the prototype — which began operating in the city of Pornainen in southern Finland this month, where it is expected to reduce carbon emissions from district heating by 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously, the majority of heat needed for the system came from burning oil, but that has now been completely eliminated. The system will continue to burn wood chips to supplement the sand battery. Wood chips are at least carbon neutral, although not an ideal solution since it takes years for trees to grow but only minutes for the chips to burn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the commissioning ceremony for the new battery, Mikko Paajanen, CEO of Loviisan Lämpö, said, “A couple of years ago, we started considering how to take district heating in Pornainen to the next level. It would have been easy to simply replace the old wood chip power plant with a new one of the same kind, but that didn’t align with our goals. We evaluated every possible alternative, and the Sand Battery proved to be the best option.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The battery is a 42 foot tall, 50 foot wide steel cylinder filled with 2,000 tons of crushed stone. According to Fast Company, when extra renewable electricity is available, the system uses it to heat up the crushed stone, where it is stored until needed. Then the heat from the battery travels to other buildings through a system of pipes filled with hot water. Each building has its own equipment to distribute the heat to radiators, floor heaters, or other heating devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have already learnt that our system has even more potential than we initially calculated. It’s been a positive surprise,” said Ylönen after the prototype was placed in service. “Whenever there’s a high surge of available green electricity, we want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly.” The need to use energy more wisely was driven home for Finns after Russia stopped providing electricity, methane, and oil to Finland when it voted to join NATO. Finland and Russia share a common border.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sand Battery Is Simple &amp;amp; Efficient&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sand battery is simplicity itself. “We just heat air and [circulate it] through sand,” says Liisa Naskali, COO of Polar Night Energy. But materials other than sand can be used. The new battery actually uses crushed soapstone chips from a local fireplace manufacturer. Sand, or other material crushed into sand-size particles, has the ability to store heat for weeks. Unlike some other batteries, the system doesn’t rely on chemicals, doesn’t degrade, and won’t catch on fire. In operation, the sand battery has demonstrated a round trip efficiency of 90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the steel tank, a heat exchanger and a closed loop system are used to circulate the heat. Software runs heaters when electricity prices are low. So far this summer, the district heating operator has paid only about 10 percent of the average price of electricity because heating the system only occurred at optimal times. That helps make the technology cost competitive, although the initial installation cost is fairly high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polar Night is now in talks with other district heating companies and factory owners with a need for high temperature process heat. For the company, the project in Pornainen is a critical proof point. “This is really important for us because now we can show that this really works,” a spokesperson for Polar Night said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Investment Opportunities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polar Night and its partners see a bright financial future for sand batteries because they can participate in electricity reserve markets, reduce dependence on single energy sources in heat production, and serve as an excellent example of sector integration between electricity and heat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“For us, the sand battery is a great commercial investment, but we also wanted to boldly support an innovative solution that benefits customers, the municipality, and the entire electricity market. This is a concrete example of a cost efficient and sustainable investment. If it works here, it will work anywhere,” said Sauli Antila, the investment director at CapMan Infra, the corporate owner of Loviisan Lämpö.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The profitability of the sand battery is based on charging it according to electricity prices and Fingrid’s reserve markets. Its large storage capacity enables balancing the electricity grid and optimizing consumption over several days or even weeks. The reserve market operations and optimization of the Pornainen Sand Battery are managed by the software unit division of Elisa Industriq.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Pornainen plant can be adjusted quickly and precisely, and it also has a remarkably long energy buffer, making it well suited for reserve market optimization. Our AI solution automatically identifies the best times to charge and discharge the Sand Battery and allocates flexibility capacity to the reserve products that need it most. Continuous optimization makes it a genuinely profitable investment,” explained Jukka-Pekka Salmenkaita, vice president of AI and special projects at Elisa Industriq.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polar Night has a clear vision for the future. Construction of an electricity production pilot will begin in the coming weeks in Valkeakoski, Finland, and the company is in active negotiations for several large-scale thermal storage projects in district heating, hot air, and process steam production. “Industrial applications are particularly promising, especially where heat above 100°C is required, something electric boilers and heat pumps cannot provide,” said Polar Night COO Liisa Naskali.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This technology is never going to replace grid-scale battery storage, but could be useful in many situations where battery storage is not. A comment on the YouTube video below complained, “Not a word about return on investment in the presentation. That means it’ll never pay off. They just wasted taxpayers’ money to stroke their own egos.” MAGAlomaniacs are everywhere these days.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Kernel-hack-drill and a new approach to exploiting CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some memory corruption bugs are much harder to exploit than others. They can involve race conditions, crash the system, and impose limitations that make a researcher's life difficult. Working with such fragile vulnerabilities demands significant time and effort. CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel is one such hard bug, which received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation. In this article, I introduce my personal project kernel-hack-drill and show how it helped me to exploit CVE-2024-50264.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bug collision story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I first found a bug in &lt;code&gt;AF_VSOCK&lt;/code&gt; back in 2021 and published the article Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel. In April 2024, I was fuzzing this kernel subsystem with a customized syzkaller and found another crash in &lt;code&gt;AF_VSOCK&lt;/code&gt;. I minimized the crash reproducer and disabled KASAN. This resulted in an immediate null-ptr-deref in a kernel worker (&lt;code&gt;kworker&lt;/code&gt;). Convinced the path forward would be painful, I shelved the bug. This was a wrong decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, in autumn 2024, I decided to look at this bug again and got promising results. Then, one calm evening, I realized I'd collided with Hyunwoo Kim (@v4bel) and Wongi Lee (@qwerty): they'd already disclosed the bug as CVE-2024-50264 and used it at kernelCTF. Their patch turned my PoC exploit into a null-ptr-deref:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone who has dealt with a bug collision can imagine what I felt. I was wondering whether to keep digging into this vulnerability or just give it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Viktor Vasnetsov: Vityaz at the Crossroads (1882)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exploit strategy by @v4bel and @qwerty looked very complicated. I had other ideas, so I decided to continue my research. I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04 with a fresh OEM/HWE kernel (v6.11) as the target for my PoC exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CVE-2024-50264 analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability CVE-2024-50264 was introduced in August 2016 by commit 06a8fc78367d in Linux v4.8. It is a race condition in &lt;code&gt;AF_VSOCK&lt;/code&gt; sockets that happens between the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call and a POSIX signals, resulting in a use-after-free (UAF). An unprivileged user can trigger this bug without user namespaces, which makes it more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel uses a freed &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; object. Its size is 80 bytes, which is suitable for the &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-96&lt;/code&gt; slab cache. The memory corruption is a UAF write executed by a kernel worker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this vulnerability also brings a bunch of nasty limitations for exploitation. I can say that it's the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. The Pwnie Award is well-deserved. I'll outline those constraints shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reproducing the bug using an "immortal signal"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, an attacker should create a listening virtual socket (server vsock):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int ret = -1;
int vsock1 = 0;

vsock1 = socket(AF_VSOCK, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (vsock1 &amp;lt; 0)
	err_exit("[-] creating vsock");

ret = bind(vsock1, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));
if (ret != 0)
	err_exit("[-] binding vsock");

ret = listen(vsock1, 0); /* backlog = 0 */
if (ret != 0)
	err_exit("[-] listening vsock");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the attacker should try to open a connection from a client vsock:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define UAF_PORT 0x2712

int vsock2 = 0;
struct sockaddr_vm addr = {
	.svm_family = AF_VSOCK,
	.svm_port = UAF_PORT,
	.svm_cid = VMADDR_CID_LOCAL
};

vsock2 = socket(AF_VSOCK, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (vsock2 &amp;lt; 0)
	err_exit("[-] creating vsock");

ret = connect(vsock2, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To trigger the bug, the attacker should interrupt this &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call with a POSIX signal. @v4bel &amp;amp; @qwerty used &lt;code&gt;SIGKILL&lt;/code&gt;, but that kills the exploit process. My fuzzer stumbled on a cleaner trick that surprised me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct sigevent sev = {};
timer_t race_timer = 0;

sev.sigev_notify = SIGEV_SIGNAL;
sev.sigev_signo = 33;
ret = timer_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &amp;amp;sev, &amp;amp;race_timer);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My fuzzer discovered that a timer can fire signal 33 and interrupt &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;. Signal 33 is special. The Native POSIX Threads Library (NPTL) keeps it for internal work and the operating system quietly shields applications from it. As &lt;code&gt;man 7 nptl&lt;/code&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPTL makes internal use of the first two real-time signals (signal numbers 32 and 33). One of these signals is used to support thread cancellation and POSIX timers (see&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;timer_create(2)&lt;/code&gt;); the other is used as part of a mechanism that ensures all threads in a process always have the same UIDs and GIDs, as required by POSIX. These signals cannot be used in applications.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;True, these signals cannot be used in applications, but they are perfect for my exploit 😉&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use &lt;code&gt;timer_settime()&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;race_timer&lt;/code&gt;, which lets me choose the exact moment signal 33 interrupts &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;. Moreover, the signal is invisible to the exploit process and doesn't kill it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About memory corruption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The race condition succeeds when a signal interrupts the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call while the vulnerable socket is in the &lt;code&gt;TCP_ESTABLISHED&lt;/code&gt; state. The socket then drops into the &lt;code&gt;TCP_CLOSING&lt;/code&gt; state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (signal_pending(current)) {
	err = sock_intr_errno(timeout);
	sk-&amp;gt;sk_state = sk-&amp;gt;sk_state == TCP_ESTABLISHED ? TCP_CLOSING : TCP_CLOSE;
	sock-&amp;gt;state = SS_UNCONNECTED;
	vsock_transport_cancel_pkt(vsk);
	vsock_remove_connected(vsk);
	goto out_wait;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second attempt to connect the vulnerable vsock to the server vsock using a different &lt;code&gt;svm_cid&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR&lt;/code&gt;) provokes memory corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct sockaddr_vm addr = {
	.svm_family = AF_VSOCK,
	.svm_port = UAF_PORT,
	.svm_cid = VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR
};

/* this connect will schedule the kernel worker performing UAF */
ret = connect(vsock2, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call executes &lt;code&gt;vsock_assign_transport()&lt;/code&gt;. This function switches the virtual socket to the new &lt;code&gt;svm_cid&lt;/code&gt; transport and frees the resources tied to the previous vsock transport:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (vsk-&amp;gt;transport) {
	if (vsk-&amp;gt;transport == new_transport)
		return 0;

	/* transport-&amp;gt;release() must be called with sock lock acquired.
	 * This path can only be taken during vsock_connect(), where we
	 * have already held the sock lock. In the other cases, this
	 * function is called on a new socket which is not assigned to
	 * any transport.
	 */
	vsk-&amp;gt;transport-&amp;gt;release(vsk);
	vsock_deassign_transport(vsk);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This procedure closes the old vsock transport in &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_close()&lt;/code&gt; and frees the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; object in &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_destruct()&lt;/code&gt;. However, due to the erroneous &lt;code&gt;TCP_CLOSING&lt;/code&gt; state of the socket, &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_close()&lt;/code&gt; initiates further communication. To handle that activity, the kernel schedules a &lt;code&gt;kworker&lt;/code&gt; that eventually calls &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt;, which operates on the freed structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static bool virtio_transport_space_update(struct sock *sk, struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	struct virtio_vsock_hdr *hdr = virtio_vsock_hdr(skb);
	struct vsock_sock *vsk = vsock_sk(sk);
	struct virtio_vsock_sock *vvs = vsk-&amp;gt;trans; /* ptr to freed object */
	bool space_available;

	if (!vvs)
		return true;

	spin_lock_bh(&amp;amp;vvs-&amp;gt;tx_lock); /* proceed if 4 bytes are zero (UAF write non-zero to lock) */
	vvs-&amp;gt;peer_buf_alloc = le32_to_cpu(hdr-&amp;gt;buf_alloc); /* UAF write 4 bytes */
	vvs-&amp;gt;peer_fwd_cnt = le32_to_cpu(hdr-&amp;gt;fwd_cnt); /* UAF write 4 bytes */
	space_available = virtio_transport_has_space(vsk); /* UAF read, not interesting */
	spin_unlock_bh(&amp;amp;vvs-&amp;gt;tx_lock); /* UAF write, restore 4 zero bytes */
	return space_available;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the layout of the UAF in the vulnerable object:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here in yellow I show the &lt;code&gt;tx_lock&lt;/code&gt; field that must be zero. Otherwise, the kernel hangs while trying to acquire the spinlock. In red I show the &lt;code&gt;peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt; fields that are overwritten after the object is freed. There is no pointer dereference in the freed object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The value written to &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt; can be controlled from the userspace:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Increase the range for the value that we want to write during UAF: */
uaf_val_limit = 0x1lu; /* can't be zero */
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_MIN_SIZE,
           &amp;amp;uaf_val_limit, sizeof(uaf_val_limit));
uaf_val_limit = 0xfffffffflu;
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE,
           &amp;amp;uaf_val_limit, sizeof(uaf_val_limit));

/* Set the 4-byte value that we want to write during UAF: */
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_SIZE,
           &amp;amp;uaf_val, sizeof(uaf_val));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The field &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt; tracks how many bytes have been pushed through vsock using &lt;code&gt;sendmsg()&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;recvmsg()&lt;/code&gt;. It is zero by default (four zero bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Not so fast. CVE-2024-50264 has limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, this vulnerability has a lot of nasty limitations for the exploitation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after &lt;code&gt;kfree()&lt;/code&gt;, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after &lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt;(eight seconds).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The kworker hangs in &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;is not zero, as noted above.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I uncovered each obstacle one by one while developing the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264. It remains the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. I guess that's why it received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First thoughts on exploit strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exploit strategy by @v4bel and @qwerty was complex:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A large-scale BPF JIT spray that filled a significant portion of physical memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The SLUBStick technique from Graz University of Technology, which allowed to: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Determine the number of objects in the active slab using a timing side channel&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Then, place the client and server &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;objects in different slabs, landing one at the end of its slab and the other at the start of the next slab&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Dirty Pagetable technique, which allowed to use the UAF object for overwriting a page table entry (PTE)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modifying a PTE to make it possibly point to a BPF JIT region&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inserting a privilege-escalation payload into the BPF code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Communicating via a socket to execute the privilege-escalation payload.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I felt I could make the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264 much simpler. My first thought was to steer the UAF write into some victim object and build a useful exploit primitive around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided not to search victim objects inside the &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-96&lt;/code&gt; slab cache. Ubuntu Server 24.04 ships with &lt;code&gt;kconfig&lt;/code&gt; options that neutralize naive heap spraying for UAF exploitation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS=y&lt;/code&gt;, which creates a set of separate slab caches for allocations with user-controlled data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES=y&lt;/code&gt;. Here's a quote from the kernel documentation about it:&lt;p&gt;It is a hardening feature that creates multiple copies of slab caches for normal kmalloc allocation and makes kmalloc randomly pick one based on code address, which makes the attackers more difficult to spray vulnerable memory objects on the heap for the purpose of exploiting memory vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's why I decided to perform the cross-cache attack anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first victim object I decided to try was &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;. Its size is 184 bytes, and the kernel allocates these objects in slabs of size 192 bytes. That would allow only two possible offsets of the UAF in the victim &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt;, because slabs for the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; have size 96 bytes (half of 192). The diagram below shows how two vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects overlap the &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt; object. The memory corruption may happen on one of the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt; reallocated at the place of the freed &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects doesn't provide anything useful for the attacker:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the UAF happened on the first &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, the kernel would hang in&lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;, because&lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt;has a non-null&lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;value at the place of&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the UAF happened on the second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, writing controlled data to&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt;would corrupt the&lt;code&gt;cred.request_key_auth&lt;/code&gt;pointer. I had no idea how to use it without a prior infoleak.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt; object didn't work for me, so I started to search for the next candidate. My next victim object for the memory corruption was &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;. I like this object: I first used it for heap spraying in 2021 (you can find the details in the article "Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a novel approach back then. This time, I set out to create something new again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I chose a 96-byte &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; because the slab allocator would use slabs of the same size for this &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;. That would allow the UAF write to land at a fixed offset in the victim &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; object. The following diagram shows what happens with the &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; object allocated at the place of the freed &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_list.prev&lt;/code&gt; is the kernelspace pointer to the previous object in the linked list. This pointer is zero when &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; is created (see &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON&lt;/code&gt;) and then it is initialized with a non-null value when &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; is inserted into the message queue. Unfortunately, this non-null pointer is interpreted as &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;. That makes the &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt; function hang while executing &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To bypass this restriction, I needed the kernel to initialize &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_list.prev&lt;/code&gt; after the UAF write. I looked for a way to postpone placing &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; in the message queue and eventually found the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;msg_msg spray allowing m_list field corruption (novel technique)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I filled the message queue almost completely before sending the target &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The message queue size is &lt;code&gt;MSGMNB=16384&lt;/code&gt;bytes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I sent 2 clogging messages of 8191 bytes each without calling the &lt;code&gt;msgrcv()&lt;/code&gt;syscall.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Only 2 bytes were left in the queue.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;mtype = 1&lt;/code&gt;for these messages.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The message queue size is &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then I performed spraying by calling &lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;for the target&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;objects.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;I called the &lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;syscall in separate pthreads and used&lt;code&gt;mtype = 2&lt;/code&gt;for these messages to distinguish them from the clogging messages.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The kernel allocates target &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;and then blocks&lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;in&lt;code&gt;ipc/msg.c&lt;/code&gt;while it waits for space in the message queue:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (msg_fits_inqueue(msq, msgsz)) break; /* queue full, wait: */ if (msgflg &amp;amp; IPC_NOWAIT) { err = -EAGAIN; goto out_unlock0; } /* enqueue the sender and prepare to block */ ss_add(msq, &amp;amp;s, msgsz); if (!ipc_rcu_getref(&amp;amp;msq-&amp;gt;q_perm)) { err = -EIDRM; goto out_unlock0; } ipc_unlock_object(&amp;amp;msq-&amp;gt;q_perm); rcu_read_unlock(); schedule();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I called the &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;syscalls were waiting for space in the message queue, I performed the UAF write corrupting the&lt;code&gt;m_list&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;m_type&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;m_ts&lt;/code&gt;fields of one of the target&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;objects.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the UAF write, I called&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;msgrcv()&lt;/code&gt;for type 1 clogging messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then the blocked &lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;syscall woke up to add the sprayed&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;to the queue and the kernel fixed the corrupted&lt;code&gt;m_list&lt;/code&gt;field:&lt;code&gt;if (!pipelined_send(msq, msg, &amp;amp;wake_q)) { /* no one is waiting for this message, enqueue it */ list_add_tail(&amp;amp;msg-&amp;gt;m_list, &amp;amp;msq-&amp;gt;q_messages); msq-&amp;gt;q_cbytes += msgsz; msq-&amp;gt;q_qnum++; percpu_counter_add_local(&amp;amp;ns-&amp;gt;percpu_msg_bytes, msgsz); percpu_counter_add_local(&amp;amp;ns-&amp;gt;percpu_msg_hdrs, 1); }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cool! This technique is also useful for blind overwriting of &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; using the out-of-bounds write. No kernel infoleak is needed. The kernel restores the corrupted &lt;code&gt;m_list&lt;/code&gt; pointers. In my particular case, this approach allowed me to avoid &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt; hanging in &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To implement the UAF write into an &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; object, I needed to perform cross-cache attack turning &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;. On Ubuntu Server 24.04, the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects live in one of 16 &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-rnd-?-96&lt;/code&gt; slab caches enabled by &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; objects live in a dedicated &lt;code&gt;msg_msg-96&lt;/code&gt; slab cache enabled by &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To implement the cross-cache attack, I needed to learn how these attacks work on the latest Ubuntu kernel, but testing exploit primitives together with this crazy race condition was really painful. Then, I got an idea:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If an unstable race condition creates problems, let's use a testing ground for developing the exploit primitives!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kernel Hack Drill&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2017, I created a pet project for my students called kernel-hack-drill. It provides a test environment for learning and experimenting with Linux kernel exploits. I remembered it and decided to use &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; to develop the exploit primitives for CVE-2024-50264.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; is an open-source project published under the &lt;code&gt;GPL-3.0&lt;/code&gt; license. It contains the following parts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.c&lt;/code&gt;is a small Linux kernel module that provides the&lt;code&gt;/proc/drill_act&lt;/code&gt;file as a simple interface to userspace. This module contains vulnerabilities that you can control and experiment with.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill.h&lt;/code&gt;is a header file describing the&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.ko&lt;/code&gt;interface:&lt;code&gt;enum drill_act_t { DRILL_ACT_NONE = 0, DRILL_ACT_ALLOC = 1, DRILL_ACT_CALLBACK = 2, DRILL_ACT_SAVE_VAL = 3, DRILL_ACT_FREE = 4, DRILL_ACT_RESET = 5 }; #define DRILL_ITEM_SIZE 95 struct drill_item_t { unsigned long foobar; void (*callback)(void); char data[]; /* C99 flexible array */ }; #define DRILL_N 10240&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_test.c&lt;/code&gt;is a userspace test for&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.ko&lt;/code&gt;that provides the examples of using&lt;code&gt;/proc/drill_act&lt;/code&gt;. This test doesn't provoke memory corruptions in&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.ko&lt;/code&gt;and it passes if&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_KASAN=y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;includes a detailed step-by-step setup guide on how to use&lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt;(kudos to the contributors!).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: when I chose the name &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; for this project, I used the word &lt;code&gt;drill&lt;/code&gt; to mean &lt;code&gt;training&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;workout&lt;/code&gt; for Linux kernel security. My friends and students read it differently. They thought I meant something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; project is a bit similar to KRWX, but much simpler. Moreover, it ships with ready-made PoC exploits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_callback.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that invokes a callback inside a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;structure. It hijacks control flow and gains LPE.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;. It uses a cross-cache attack and overwrites&lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_ts&lt;/code&gt;enabling out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory. I wrote this PoC while working on the bug described in this article.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;. It performs a cross-cache attack and overwrites&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.flags&lt;/code&gt;to implement the Dirty Pipe technique and gain LPE. This PoC exploit was also developed during my experiments with CVE-2024-50264.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent contributions added new variants (kudos to the contributors!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_callback_rop_smep.c&lt;/code&gt;: an improved version of&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_callback.c&lt;/code&gt;that adds a ROP chain to bypass SMEP on&lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pte.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that writes to a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;. It performs a cross-allocator attack and overwrites a page table entry (PTE) to implement the Dirty Pagetable technique and gain LPE on&lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pud.c&lt;/code&gt;: an improved version of&lt;code&gt;__drill_uaf_w_pte.c__&lt;/code&gt;that overwrites a page upper directory (PUD) instead of a PTE and implements the Dirty Pagetable attack via huge pages.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I revisited &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; during my CVE-2024-50264 work, this spare-time project hadn't seen an update in years. But now &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; offers a solid set of resources that Linux kernel security researchers can explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experimenting with cross-cache attack using kernel-hack-drill&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first step was to learn how cross-cache attacks behave on the latest Ubuntu kernel with slab allocator hardening turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I implemented a standard cross-cache attack in &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c&lt;/code&gt;. You can see the full code in the repository, so I'll sketch the flow here. For background, I highly recommend Andrey Konovalov's talk SLUB Internals for Exploit Developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To plan the attack, I pulled the needed info from &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/slab&lt;/code&gt;. The slab caches that hold &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; (80 bytes) or &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt; (95 bytes) each keep 120 slabs in per-CPU partial lists (&lt;code&gt;cpu_partial=120&lt;/code&gt;) and 42 objects in each slab (&lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab=42&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cross-cache attack algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects to create a fresh active slab. Active slab is the slab that will be used by the kernel for the next allocation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab * cpu_partial&lt;/code&gt;objects. This creates the&lt;code&gt;cpu_partial&lt;/code&gt;number of full slabs that will later populate the partial list at step 6.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a slab that contains the UAF object. Allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects and keep a dangling reference to the vulnerable object in that slab.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a new active slab again: allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects. This step is very important for keeping the cross-cache attack stable. Otherwise, the slab with the vulnerable object remains active and cannot be reclaimed by the page allocator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Completely free the slab that holds the UAF object. To do that, free &lt;code&gt;(objs_per_slab * 2 - 1)&lt;/code&gt;of the objects allocated just before the last one. The active slab now contains only the last object, and the slab with the UAF object becomes free and moves to the partial list.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fill up the partial list: free one of each &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects in the reserved slabs from step 2. That makes the slab allocator clean up the partial list and move the free slab containing the UAF object to the page allocator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reclaim the page that contained the UAF object for another slab cache: spray the target &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;objects. As a result, one&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;is allocated where the vulnerable object (&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;in my case) used to be.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exploit the UAF! Overwrite &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_ts&lt;/code&gt;to read kernel memory out of bounds.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've seen plenty of publications that cover cross-cache attack, but none of them explain how to debug it. I'll fill that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's examine the attack in &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c&lt;/code&gt;. To watch it in action and debug it, make the following tweaks in your kernel sources:&lt;/p&gt;

Running the PoC exploit &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; makes this visible, as we observe:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the kernel log: &lt;code&gt;[ 32.719582] drill: kmalloc'ed item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660, size 95)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then in stdout: &lt;code&gt;[+] done, current_n: 5124 (next for allocating) [!] obtain dangling reference from use-after-free bug [+] done, uaf_n: 5123&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Finally, in the kernel log: &lt;code&gt;[ 36.778165] drill: free item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660) ... [ 36.807956] __put_partials: cache 0xffff888003c45300 slab 0xffffea0000325800 ... [ 36.892053] msg_msg 0xffff88800c960660&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see the &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt; object &lt;code&gt;0xffff88800c960660&lt;/code&gt; in slab &lt;code&gt;0xffffea0000325800&lt;/code&gt; reallocated as &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;, which confirms that the cross-cache attack worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After experimenting with &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; on Ubuntu Server 24.04, I found that &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS&lt;/code&gt; block naive UAF exploitation, yet they also make cross-cache attacks absolutely stable. So, in my humble opinion:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that, without a mitigation such as SLAB_VIRTUAL, the Linux kernel remains wide-open to cross-cache attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adapting the cross-cache attack to CVE-2024-50264&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted in the limitations, the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; client object is allocated together with the server object (Limitation #1). That hurts the exploit for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On one hand, leaving the server vsock open stops the slab that holds the UAF object from being freed, which kills the cross-cache attack.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On the other hand, closing the server vsock disturbs the UAF itself.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to deal with it? @v4bel and @qwerty used the SLUBStick timing side channel to spot when the allocator switched to a new active slab. I went another way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if I hit the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;syscall with a signal almost immediately?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, I used one more race condition to exploit the main race condition – and it worked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I sent the "immortal" signal 33 to the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;syscall after a 10000 ns timeout, far earlier than the delay needed to trigger the UAF.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then I verified the early race condition: &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;syscall must return "Interrupted system call"&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Another testing client vsock should still connect to the server vsock without trouble&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I discovered that when both checks passed, only a single vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; for the client vsock was created. The interrupting signal arrived before the kernel could create the second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; for the server vsock. This bypassed Limitation #1 (paired-object creation). After that, I sent signal 33 again – this time after the normal timeout – to interrupt the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; a second time and provoke the UAF. The cross-cache attack against &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; was unlocked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looping this early race and checking its result was quick. Once the early race succeeded, the main race that triggers the UAF became more stable; I could now hit the UAF about once per second instead of once every several minutes, solving the instability noted in Limitation #2. My race condition "speedrun" also eased Limitation #5: I managed roughly five UAF writes before the kworker hit a null-ptr-deref at &lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt; (8 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address Limitation #4 (the immediate null-ptr-deref in the kworker after UAF), I tried one more race condition, similarly to @v4bel and @qwerty. Right after the UAF-triggering &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;, I called &lt;code&gt;listen()&lt;/code&gt; on the vulnerable vsock. If &lt;code&gt;listen()&lt;/code&gt; ran before the kworker, it changed the vsock state to &lt;code&gt;TCP_LISTEN&lt;/code&gt;, preventing the crash. Unfortunately, this step remains the most unstable part of the whole exploit; the rest is far more stable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point my list of CVE-2024-50264 limitations looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;The vulnerable&lt;/del&gt;&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.&lt;/del&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after &lt;code&gt;kfree()&lt;/code&gt;, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.&lt;/del&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after&lt;/del&gt;&lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt;(eight seconds).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The kworker hangs in &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;is not zero.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the early-signal trick in place, only two limitations were still blocking my exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Oh so slow! The cross-cache attack shows up late to the party&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted in Limitation #3, the UAF write in the kworker fires only a few μs after &lt;code&gt;kfree()&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;. A cross-cache attack needs much more time, so the UAF write lands on the original &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; and never reaches the &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't know how to make cross-cache procedure faster, but I knew how to slow down the attacked kernel code instead. That approach is described in Jann Horn's article Racing against the clock. It allowed to make my kworker slower than a sluggish cross-cache attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main idea is to hammer the kworker with a &lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt; watched by a huge pile of &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt; instances. Here is the short recipe (see Jann's article for full detail):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Call &lt;code&gt;timerfd_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, 0)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create 8 forks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In each fork, call &lt;code&gt;dup()&lt;/code&gt;for the&lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt;100 times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In each fork, call &lt;code&gt;epoll_create()&lt;/code&gt;500 times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For every &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt;instance, use&lt;code&gt;epoll_ctl()&lt;/code&gt;to add all duplicated file descriptors to the interest list – each&lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt;instance now monitors all available&lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt;copies.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, arm the &lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt;so the interrupt hits the kworker at just the right moment:&lt;code&gt;timerfd_settime(timerfd, TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET, &amp;amp;retard_tmo, NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This procedure made my race-condition window around 80 times longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted some more time to complete the cross-cache attack with a guarantee, but ran into a limit not mentioned in the original write-up. If you exceed the limit in &lt;code&gt;/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;epoll_ctl()&lt;/code&gt; fails. From &lt;code&gt;man 7 epoll&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This specifies a limit on the total number of file descriptors that a user can register across all epoll instances on the system. The limit is per real user ID. Each registered file descriptor costs roughly 90 bytes on a 32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel. Currently, the default value for max_user_watches is 1/25 (4%) of the available low memory, divided by the registration cost in bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Ubuntu Server 24.04 with 2 GiB of RAM, &lt;code&gt;/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches&lt;/code&gt; is 431838, which is not huge. I could afford 8 forks × 500 &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt; instances × 100 duplicated file descriptors, for a total of 400000 &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt; watches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was just enough to beat Limitation #3, and I finally got &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; data size corruption: the vsock UAF changed &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_ts&lt;/code&gt; from 48 bytes to 8192 (&lt;code&gt;MSGMAX&lt;/code&gt;). Now I could do out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory using the &lt;code&gt;msgrcv()&lt;/code&gt; syscall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sorting the loot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The corrupted &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; allowed me to read 8 KiB of data from the kernelspace.  I sorted this loot and found a promising infoleak: a kernel address &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff8233cfa0&lt;/code&gt; [1]. This infoleak was quite stable and worked with high probability, so I decided to investigate it without doing any additional heap feng shui. GDB showed that it was a pointer to the &lt;code&gt;socket_file_ops()&lt;/code&gt; kernel function. I was excited to discover that this function pointer is part of &lt;code&gt;struct file&lt;/code&gt;, because the &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; kernel object also contains the &lt;code&gt;f_cred&lt;/code&gt; pointer [2], which leaked as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how I examined the memory leaked by &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;0xffff88800e75d600&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; p *((struct file *)(0xffff88800e75d600 + 96*26 + 64))
$61 = {
  f_count = {
    counter = 0x0
  },
  f_lock = {
    {
      rlock = {
        raw_lock = {
          {
            val = {
              counter = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked = 0x0,
              pending = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked_pending = 0x0,
              tail = 0x0
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  f_mode = 0x82e0003,
  f_op = 0xffffffff8233cfa0 &amp;lt;socket_file_ops&amp;gt;,    [1]
  f_mapping = 0xffff88800ee66f60,
  private_data = 0xffff88800ee66d80,
  f_inode = 0xffff88800ee66e00,
  f_flags = 0x2,
  f_iocb_flags = 0x0,
  f_cred = 0xffff888003b7ad00,                    [2]
  f_path = {
    mnt = 0xffff8880039cec20,
    dentry = 0xffff888005b30b40
  },
  ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, my PoC exploit obtained a pointer to &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;, the structure that stores the current process credentials. The last piece needed for privilege escalation was arbitrary address writing. With that, I could overwrite the exploit process credentials and become root. That would be a data-only attack with no control-flow hijack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In search of arbitrary address writing primitive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most interesting and difficult part of the research began here. I was searching for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing exploit primitive. The search was exhausting. I've done the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Looked through dozens of kernel objects,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read many kernel exploit write-ups,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tried Kernel Exploitation Dashboard by Eduardo Vela and the KernelCTF team.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One idea was to combine my limited UAF write with the Dirty Page Table attack (well described by Nicolas Wu). Tweaking page tables can let an attacker read and write data at arbitrary physical address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could combine my UAF with a cross-cache attack (or more accurately, cross-allocator attack) to modify page tables. To overwrite kernel text or heap, though, I still needed to know the physical address of the target memory. Two options came to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bruteforcing physical addresses. Not practical here: I could trigger the UAF only about five times before the kworker crashed, nowhere near enough tries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using the KASLR infoleak from my &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;out-of-bounds read. I decided to try that.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran a quick experiment to see how KASLR behaves on &lt;code&gt;X86_64&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY&lt;/code&gt; enabled. Booting a virtual machine several times, I compared the virtual and physical addresses of kernel &lt;code&gt;_text&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VM run #1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff98400000 T _text

gef&amp;gt; v2p 0xffffffff98400000
Virt: 0xffffffff98400000 -&amp;gt; Phys: 0x57400000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VM run #2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff81800000 T _text

gef&amp;gt; v2p 0xffffffff81800000
Virt: 0xffffffff81800000 -&amp;gt; Phys: 0x18600000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I calculated the difference between the virtual and physical addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VM run #1: &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff98400000 − 0x57400000 = 0xffffffff41000000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VM run #2: &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff81800000 − 0x18600000 = 0xffffffff69200000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff41000000&lt;/code&gt; is not equal to &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff69200000&lt;/code&gt;, leaking the virtual KASLR offset doesn't help against physical KASLR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereby to perform Dirty Page Table attack, I needed a way to leak a kernel physical address. Ideally I would do this by mixing some page-allocator feng shui with my out-of-bounds read. That felt messy, and I wanted a cleaner solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kept looking for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing and eventually focused on &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a pipe is created with the &lt;code&gt;pipe()&lt;/code&gt; system call, the kernel allocates an array of &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; structures. Each &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; item in this array corresponds to a memory page that holds data written to the pipe. The diagram below shows the internals of this object:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This object looked like a good UAF target. I could make a &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; array the same size as &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; by changing the capacity of the pipe: &lt;code&gt;fcntl(pipe_fd[1], F_SETPIPE_SZ, PAGE_SIZE * 2)&lt;/code&gt;. The kernel changes the array size to &lt;code&gt;2 * sizeof(struct pipe_buffer) = 80 bytes&lt;/code&gt;, exactly matching the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, 4 attacker-controlled bytes from the vsock UAF write at offset 24 can flip &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.flags&lt;/code&gt;, just as in Max Kellermann's original Dirty Pipe attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Dirty Pipe attack doesn't even need an infoleak and grants privilege escalation with a one-shot write. Impressed, I decided to experiment with &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; in my &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experimenting with the Dirty Pipe attack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I built a Dirty Pipe prototype in &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt;; the PoC exploit &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c&lt;/code&gt; is in the repository. It:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;performs a cross-cache attack and reclaims the slab that held &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;objects as a slab for&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;exploits the UAF write to &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;; the attacker-controlled bytes written to&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;at offset 24, modify&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.flags&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;implements the Dirty Pipe attack, achieving LPE in one shot without an infoleak, cool!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use this technique in my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit, I still had to bypass the last remaining Limitation #6: the kworker hangs before the UAF write if &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt; is non-zero. I managed to solve that by doing &lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt; from a regular file to the pipe, starting at offset zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;	loff_t file_offset = 0;
	ssize_t bytes = 0;

	/* N.B. splice modifies the file_offset value */
	bytes = splice(temp_file_fd, &amp;amp;file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0);
	if (bytes &amp;lt; 0)
		err_exit("[-] splice");
	if (bytes != 1)
		err_exit("[-] splice short");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, the &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.offset&lt;/code&gt; field remains zero, so the kworker does not hang while acquiring the spinlock:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seemed like a breakthrough – until I noticed that the UAF write also corrupted the &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.ops&lt;/code&gt; function pointer by four zero bytes of &lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt;. That unfortunate side effect provoked kernel crashes on every later operation involving &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; ☹️:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This brought me to the following line of reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Completing the Dirty Pipe attack requires a working &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;with an unchanged&lt;code&gt;ops&lt;/code&gt;pointer value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Preserving &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff&lt;/code&gt;in the most significant bytes of the&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.ops&lt;/code&gt;function pointer requires that same value in&lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setting &lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt;in&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;means sending data through the vsock.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sending data through a vsock first needs a successful &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;However, a successful &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;on the vulnerable vsock makes the UAF impossible ⛔.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pipe buffer entertainment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the original Dirty Pipe technique wouldn't fit my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit. But suddenly an idea struck me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if I create a pipe with capacity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PAGE_SIZE * 4&lt;/code&gt;forcing the kernel to allocate four&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;objects in&lt;code&gt;kmalloc-192&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, the memory object overlapping looked like this: four &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; objects in one &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-192&lt;/code&gt; slab are allocated at the place of two &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects in two &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-96&lt;/code&gt; slabs. The following diagram illustrates the overlap:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, memory corruption can land on either of the two &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects. I'll cover these cases one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid the kernel hang and crash when the UAF hits &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; #1, I used two tricks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performed a &lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt;from a regular file to the pipe with a starting offset of zero. As mentioned earlier, this keeps the&lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;field of the first&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;at zero, so the kworker doesn't hang while acquiring the spinlock.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discarded that first &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;before triggering the UAF, leaving its&lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;field untouched:&lt;code&gt;/* Remove the first pipe_buffer without changing the `pipe_buffer.offset` */ bytes = splice(pipe_fd[0], NULL, temp_pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0); if (bytes &amp;lt; 0) err_exit("[-] splice"); if (bytes == 0) err_exit("[-] splice short"); /* * Let's read this byte and empty the first pipe_buffer. * So if the UAF writing corrupts the first pipe_buffer, * that will not crash the kernel. Cool! */ bytes = read(temp_pipe_fd[0], pipe_data_to_read, 1); /* 1 spliced byte */ if (bytes &amp;lt; 0) err_exit("[-] pipe read 1"); if (bytes != 1) err_exit("[-] pipe read 1 short");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this sequence of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;, the first&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;becomes inactive. Even if the subsequent UAF overwrites its&lt;code&gt;ops&lt;/code&gt;pointer, later pipe operations won't dereference that corrupted pointer, so no kernel crash occurs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to exploit the UAF on &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; #2 to overwrite the fourth &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;. To prevent the kernel hang when the UAF hits this second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, I called the same &lt;code&gt;splice(temp_file_fd, &amp;amp;file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0)&lt;/code&gt; two more times. These syscalls initialized the second and third &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; objects, leaving their &lt;code&gt;flags&lt;/code&gt; at zero, since this pipe operation doesn't set any &lt;code&gt;PIPE_BUF_FLAG_*&lt;/code&gt; bits. Therefore, if the UAF occurs on the second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt; will not hang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These preparations of the pipe opened a door for corrupting the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; pointer of the fourth &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; let me experiment with &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; objects. Without it, crafting this exploit primitive for the tricky CVE-2024-50264 would have been extremely hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AARW and KASLR's last revenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; pointer holds the address of a &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt; inside the virtual memory map (&lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt; is an array of these structures that allows the kernel to address physical memory efficiently. It is mentioned in &lt;code&gt;Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/mm.rst&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hence, when I managed to perform a UAF write of controlled data to the &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt; pointer, I gained arbitrary address reading and writing (AARW) via the pipe. However, I wasn't able to change the AARW target address many times, as I mentioned in Limitation #5, so I had to choose the target in &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt; carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first thought was to overwrite part of the kernel code. But with KASLR enabled, I didn't know the physical address of kernel &lt;code&gt;_text&lt;/code&gt; and therefore couldn't determine its location inside &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's why I decided to use the pipe AARW against &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt; in the kernel heap. As I described earlier, I leaked the virtual address of &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt; using my &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; out-of-bounds read. This virtual address looked like &lt;code&gt;0xffff888003b7ad00&lt;/code&gt;, and I understood it was from the direct mapping of all physical memory. So I used the following formula to calculate the offset of the corresponding &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define STRUCT_PAGE_SZ 64lu
#define PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(addr) (((addr &amp;amp; 0x3ffffffflu) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ)
uaf_val = PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(cred_addr);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea behind it is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;addr &amp;amp; 0x3ffffffflu&lt;/code&gt;gives the offset of the&lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;from the&lt;code&gt;page_offset_base&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Right shift by 12 gives the number of the memory page containing &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, multiplication by 64 (the size of &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt;) gives the offset of the corresponding&lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt;in the&lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This formula should be adapted if the system has more than 4 GiB of RAM. In that case, &lt;code&gt;ZONE_NORMAL&lt;/code&gt; containing kernel allocations usually starts at address &lt;code&gt;0x100000000&lt;/code&gt;. Hence, to calculate the offset of the needed &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt;, we should add &lt;code&gt;(0x100000000 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excellent, the described formula is independent of KASLR for physical addresses, so I could use it to calculate the four lower bytes of the target address for exploiting the pipe AARW against the &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;. Why I needed only four lower bytes of &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My UAF write to &lt;code&gt;peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt;performed partial overwriting of the first half of the&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt;pointer, as I showed at the diagram above.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;is little-endian, so the first half of the pointer contains four lower bytes of the address.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when I tried this approach, KASLR carried out its last revenge. It randomized the &lt;code&gt;vmemmap_base&lt;/code&gt; address, and the four lower bytes of the &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt; pointers carried two random bits. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I decided to brute-force those two bits because I could achieve the UAF write around 5 times before the kworker got a null-ptr-deref after &lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt; (8 sec).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found that probing different values of &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt; from userspace works perfectly well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In case of fail, reading from the pipe simply returns &lt;code&gt;Bad address&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In case of success, reading from the pipe gives &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;contents.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great! I could finally determine a proper AARW target address, write to the pipe, overwrite euid and egid with 0, and get root. See the PoC exploit demo:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bug collisions are painful. Finishing the research anyway is rewarding. Let me quote my good friend:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on this hard race condition with multiple limitations allowed me to discover new exploitation techniques and to use and improve my pet project kernel-hack-drill, which provides a testing environment for Linux kernel security researchers. You are welcome to try it and contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This plugin integrates Amazon Q Developer with Neovim, providing Chat functionality, Inline Code Suggestions, and other Amazon Q capabilities. After installation, authenticate through IAM Identity Center or AWS Builder ID. You can use Amazon Q for free without an AWS account by authenticating with Builder ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NodeJS &amp;gt;=18&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Neovim &amp;gt;=0.10.4&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install the plugin using your preferred method (see Installation Options)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configure the plugin in your Neovim config: &lt;quote&gt;require('amazonq').setup({ ssoStartUrl = 'https://view.awsapps.com/start', -- Authenticate with Amazon Q Free Tier })&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ&lt;/code&gt;from any file to start using the plugin&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install and use the plugin, you only need to clone this repo and add in to Neovim runtimepath location:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- Add the plugin to Neovim's runtimepath
vim.cmd[[set runtimepath+=/path/to/amazonq.nvim]]

-- Configure the plugin
require('amazonq').setup({
  ssoStartUrl = 'https://view.awsapps.com/start', -- Authenticate with Amazon Q Free Tier
})&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;See Configuration to configure other settings. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;By default the plugin will look for &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;on your $PATH. To set an explicit location, set&lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By default the plugin will look for &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ&lt;/code&gt;from any file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional: Code completions are provided by the "textDocument/completion" LSP method, which "just works" with most autocompletion plugins. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Note: completion is limited to supported filetypes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;See Code Completions.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;local Plug = vim.fn['plug#']
vim.call('plug#begin')
Plug 'git@github.com:awslabs/amazonq.nvim.git'
vim.call('plug#end')

require('amazonq').setup({
  ssoStartUrl = 'https://view.awsapps.com/start', -- Authenticate with Amazon Q Free Tier
})&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- plugins.lua
return {
  {
    name = 'amazonq',
    url = 'https://github.com/awslabs/amazonq.nvim.git',
    opts = {
      ssoStartUrl = 'https://view.awsapps.com/start',  -- Authenticate with Amazon Q Free Tier
    },
  },
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can authenticate using one of two methods:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Amazon Q Free Tier: Use AWS Builder ID with the URL &lt;code&gt;https://view.awsapps.com/start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Amazon Q Developer Pro: Use the start URL provided by your administrator&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configure authentication by setting the &lt;code&gt;ssoStartUrl&lt;/code&gt; value in your setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;require('amazonq').setup({
  ssoStartUrl = 'https://view.awsapps.com/start', -- For Free Tier with AWS Builder ID
  -- OR
  -- ssoStartUrl = 'your-organization-sso-url', -- For Pro subscription
})&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plugin provides a single global &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ&lt;/code&gt; command and &lt;code&gt;zq&lt;/code&gt; mapping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Command/Mapping&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Open Amazon Q chat window&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;zq&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Select text, then type &lt;code&gt;zq&lt;/code&gt; to append it to the chat context. Equivalent to: select text, type &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ&lt;/code&gt;, then run the command.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ refactor&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Select code, then run this to get refactoring suggestions&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;:.AmazonQ fix&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fix only the current line (the standard "." range means "current line")&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;:%AmazonQ optimize&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Optimize the entire contents of the current file&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ explain&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Explain the current file&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For complete documentation, see :help amazonq-usage and :help amazonq-chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are the available configuration options with their default values. Only &lt;code&gt;ssoStartUrl&lt;/code&gt; is required. See :help amazonq-config
for details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;require('amazonq').setup({
  -- REQUIRED: SSO portal URL for authentication
  ssoStartUrl = 'https://view.awsapps.com/start',
  -- OR
  -- ssoStartUrl = 'your-organization-sso-url', -- For Pro subscription

  -- Command to start Amazon Q Language Server
  -- Defaults to the language server bundled with this plugin
  cmd = { 'node', 'language-server/build/aws-lsp-codewhisperer-token-binary.js', '--stdio' },
  
  -- Filetypes where the Q will be activated
  -- See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-language-ide-support.html
  -- `amazonq` is required for Q Chat feature.
  filetypes = {
      'amazonq', 'bash', 'java', 'python', 'typescript', 'javascript', 'csharp', 
      'ruby', 'kotlin', 'sh', 'sql', 'c', 'cpp', 'go', 'rust', 'lua',
  },

  -- Enable/disable inline code suggestions
  inline_suggest = true,

  -- Configure the chat panel position and appearance
  on_chat_open = function()
    vim.cmd[[
      vertical topleft split
      set wrap breakindent nonumber norelativenumber nolist
    ]]
  end,

  -- Enable debug mode for development
  debug = false,
})&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Q provides AI-powered code suggestions as you type. These are implemented through the LSP &lt;code&gt;textDocument/completion&lt;/code&gt; method and work with most Neovim completion plugins (nvim-cmp, blink, mini.completion, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use inline suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Authenticate with &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ login&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start typing in a supported filetype&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trigger completion using your completion plugin's keybinding&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inline suggestions are enabled by default. To disable them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;require('amazonq').setup({
  -- Other settings...
  inline_suggest = false,
})&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For plugin-specific configuration, see :help amazonq-config-completion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To verify the language server is running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;:checkhealth vim.lsp&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows if the server is attached to the current file and displays the path to the log file (e.g. &lt;code&gt;/local/home/$user/.local/state/nvim/lsp.log&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see detailed communication between the plugin and Language Server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;vim.lsp.set_log_level('debug')&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the plugin isn't working, ensure NodeJS &amp;gt;=18 is installed and in your PATH&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For authentication issues, verify your &lt;code&gt;ssoStartUrl&lt;/code&gt;is correct&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For filetype-specific problems, check that the filetype is in your &lt;code&gt;filetypes&lt;/code&gt;configuration&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To develop this plugin, you probably want to add it to the Nvim &lt;code&gt;'runtimepath'&lt;/code&gt; so that you can test your changes easily. In that case, remove it from your plugin manager config.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clone amazonq.nvim package locally:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:awslabs/amazonq.nvim.git&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remove amazonq.nvim from your plugin manager config, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the amazonq.nvim package to the Nvim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;'runtimepath'&lt;/code&gt;. This tells Nvim to look for plugins at that path.&lt;quote&gt;vim.cmd[[set runtimepath+=/path/to/amazonq.nvim]]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now use the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;amazonq&lt;/code&gt;plugin located in the amazonq.nvim package path. You can make edits, restart Nvim to test them, open Pull Requests, etc.&lt;quote&gt;require('amazonq').setup({ ssoStartUrl = 'https://view.awsapps.com/start', debug = true, -- Enable debug mode during development })&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See develop.md for more implementation details of plugin and language server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To debug the LSP server, see https://github.com/aws/language-servers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#with-other-clients&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To enable logging, pass &lt;code&gt;debug=true&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;require('amazonq').setup{}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logs are written to &lt;code&gt;vim.fs.joinpath(vim.fn.stdpath('log'), 'amazonq.log')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nvim also produces its own &lt;code&gt;vim.lsp&lt;/code&gt;logs by default.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Enable DEBUG log-level for Nvim lsp (hint: put this in a workspace-local &lt;code&gt;.nvim.lua&lt;/code&gt;file and enable the&lt;code&gt;:help 'exrc'&lt;/code&gt;option):&lt;code&gt;vim.lsp.set_log_level('debug')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;File: &lt;code&gt;:lua =vim.lsp.log.get_filename()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Logs produced by Amazon Q Language server will appear there as &lt;code&gt;"window/logMessage"&lt;/code&gt;messages:&lt;code&gt;"window/logMessage", … "Runtime: Initializing runtime without encryption", type = 3 } } "window/logMessage", … "Runtime: Registering IAM credentials update handler", type = 3 } } "window/logMessage", … "Runtime: Registering bearer credentials update handler", type = 3 } } ...

      &lt;item&gt;Run (from the top level directory): &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;To check files both selene and stylua in check mode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;make lint&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;To format files with stylua:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;make format&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Inline suggestions are provided by creating a in-process LSP shim client is named &lt;code&gt;amazonq-completion&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This is a temporary measure until Q LSP provides this out of the box.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Vim has a known limitation where it replaces newlines &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;in multiline completions with NUL bytes, which it renders as&lt;code&gt;^@&lt;/code&gt;. amazonq.nvim works around this by replacing the NUL bytes in a&lt;code&gt;CompleteDone&lt;/code&gt;event-handler.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
