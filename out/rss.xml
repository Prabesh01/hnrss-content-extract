    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OrangePi 6 Plus Review: The New Frontier for ARM64 SBC Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So after our previous reviews (that started mainly around RISC-V since we are really interested in this new architecture) of SBC, we continue to review what’s available these days in the world of small, versatile computers. Today this is going to be about the OrangePi 6 Plus, following our previous review of the OrangePi 5 ultra board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is NOT a super small, credit card format SBC. We are talking about something that’s definitely larger, and that comes directly with an integrated heatsink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the bottom there’s a wealth of ports, and it’s where you will install the necessary wireless module if you want Wifi and Bluetooth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s dive into what you can do with this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is what you can get from the top of the device. Note that most of it will be hidden from view as the board comes pre-installed with the heatsink that covers the SOC and the memory chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the bottom view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can tell just from the format that you should have higher expectations from the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Specs of the OrangePi 6 Plus&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a table format:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see from the specs, this is no joke. 16GB RAM by default, 12-cores processor, with a powerful GPU (Immortalis G720), and a NPU that has a claimed performance up to 30 TOPS. Not just that, but there’s numerous ports on this SBC, with 2 full sized M2 2280 slots! You can tell that the IO is not going to be a joke here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are wondering about the SOC itself, we have more info about what to expect from CIX.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Integrated Security Engine (Standard Arm SystemReady / ACPI support)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2.8Ghz ARM Big Cores processors! That’s no joke, this is way beyond the typical frequency we see for small boards where things are usually below 2 Ghz. The memory interface also has a huge bandwidth, and we get full PCI4 with 8 lanes! This means that this board could probably be attached to an external GPU (eGPU) and be able to drive it (provided adequate software support).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About the NPU, the usual problem on Linux is that there is poor software support, and it’s certainly not in the mainline either. To leverage the 30 TOPS of dedicated AI power, you cannot simply use standard versions of PyTorch or TensorFlow out of the box. You must use the NeuralONE AI SDK. This also means that the NPU cannot use regular weights, and need to compile them into a different format to make them work. On paper, the NPU is highly versatile and supports the following data types: INT4, INT8, INT16, FP16, BF16, and TF32. The board has extensive documentation on a bunch of embedded models for vision detection, automation, such as YOLOv8 (Vision), ResNet50, OpenPose, and DeepLabv3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s jump into the actual user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Software Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Desktop Experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Debian Bookworm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a Debian Bookworm (12) image available at the time of writing. I was actually waiting for a 24.04 Ubuntu image to be made available, and that was the plan at some point according to my OrangePi contact, but they had to shift priorities apparently and now there is no ETA for the Ubuntu image. So instead of waiting, I decided to go ahead and review what’s possible with this Debian image. As you know, Debian Bookworm is not that new anymore (the base is from Mid-2023), and is now superseded by Debian Trixie (released in 2025). This Debian image comes with two kernels available, 6.1 and 6.6. The 6.6 kernel is also from 2023, and it’s not surprising you don’t get a more recent kernel, since the Linux support for various parts of the boards, not being upstreamed and mainlined, is very likely to be stuck on an older version. This is usually what causes headaches down the road: maybe some general functionality can be upstreamed, but will the NPU have working drivers for a more recent kernel? Your guess is as good as mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can burn the image directly on the NVME drive - no need to boot on a MicroSD card this time around. Note that at the beginning, my OrangePi did not boot, but I could see from the BIOS (yes, this board comes with a BIOS-like interface!) that everything was supposed to be seen by the SBC. Turns out that the firmware required an update to be able to boot on this Linux kernel, and after imaging the latest firmware on a USB stick and booting on it, a few minutes later, things worked as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, we get a GNOME desktop after boot. And everything works pretty much as you’d expect. Once thing that is immediately apparent when you start with the desktop is how snappy everything is. SBC boards like the Raspberry Pi 4 provide a good desktop experience but have some general sluggishness to them. On this board, this is pretty much like having a X86_64 experience. It recognized immediately my Ultra Wide Display and supported the 3440 x 1440 resolution without a hitch. Everything from navigating the desktop and settings is very fast. You get Chromium by default (and Firefox ESR in the repos) and the browser experience is very clean and fast, too. This board has absolutely no problem to play Youtube streams, even at 4k. This thing is FAST!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick look at vulkaninfo shows that we have working Vulkan drivers on this board! This is something that was initially very exciting, but it turns out that there are some limitations. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out the Vulkan driver is limited to some early 1.3 version. You have options to upgrade Mesa, by using Debian backports - it gets you to a 25.07 Mesa version, where you don’t rely anymore on the proprietary driver - no, this time you get Panfrost, which means a more robust driver potentially… except that you are stuck on the 6.6 Linux Kernel, and Panfrost requires a more recent kernel to work properly (6.10+ apparently). So the solution would be to move to a more recent kernel, right? Do the Debian backports have it? Yes. Problem is, moving away from 6.6 will break a lot of patches that are necessary for the hardware of this board to work. Such as HDMI out at resolutions higher than 1080p, and NPU support! So, it’s a major trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Getting Bluetooth to work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though bluetooth shows in the GNOME desktop controls, and that it could see some of my peripherals, it could not connect to any of my external audio devices. But I don’t give up so fast. Turns out there’s an issue with a missing pipewire dependency to allow for bluetooth audio to work. Here’s how you can get it done:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install libspa-0.2-bluetooth pipewire-audio-client-libraries
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afterwards you can launch bluetoothctl from the command line, and you can execute the following commands one by one&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;power on
agent on
default-agent
scan on
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the scan is activated you should see bluetooth device popping up in the terminal. Note the ID of the bluetooth device you want to connect, and then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pair &amp;lt;device id&amp;gt;
trust &amp;lt;device id&amp;gt;
connect &amp;lt;devic_id&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once this is fixed, things work as expected. And now I get audio!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Compiling OBS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OBS is not available as flatpak for arm64, and not in the repos either. This means, that you are in for a compilation from sources. This is not the thing that scares me. But in our situation, it’s a little more convoluted that I expected. First, turns out that OBS did not like the fact that the Cmake was relatively old. So I had to get one of the recent Cmake binaries. Thanksfully they have arm64 binaries already available on their website, so that was easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, OBS would complain of a too old FFmpeg version. Not too surprising for something that depends so heavily on it. So I had to go for a full FFmpeg compilation. Here’s what I did to save you time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg.git
cd ffmpeg
git checkout release/7.1 # in order to have a stable release, not the master branch in itself

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265
make -j$(nproc)

sudo make install
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, compiling OBS is a game of cat and mouse, you need to basically give up one extension after the other as new errors arise. Most of the things you need to remove are not critical (NVENC, not relevant on non-nvidia hardware, browser support, not really our thing either) and at the end you get a fairly long series of command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio.git
cd obs-studio

# remove the obs-browser plugin from the obs folder root directlroy
mv plugins/obs-browser plugins/obs-browser.bak

# from the obs root folder
git submodule update --init --recursive

# a couple of exports to avoid the compilation to fail because of FFmpeg warnings
export CFLAGS="-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations"
export CXXFLAGS="-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations"

# since the flags can be ignored, we also edit the following file from the root directory
echo 'target_compile_options(obs-ffmpeg PRIVATE "-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations")' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; plugins/obs-ffmpeg/CMakeLists.txt

# use the path to the cmake version you just downloaded
&amp;lt;path_to_newer_cmake_binary&amp;gt;/cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local -DFFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include  -DPKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig -DENABLE_AJA=OFF -DUNIX_STRUCTURE=1 -DENABLE_GIO=OFF -DENABLE_VPL=OFF  -DENABLE_QSV11=OFF -DENABLE_BROWSER=OFF  -DENABLE_WEBRTC=OFF -DENABLE_NATIVE_NVENC=OFF -DCMAKE_COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR=OFF ..

make -j$(nproc)

sudo make install

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took a little while, but it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I must admit, I did not expect that it would go so well in the end. Now, thanks to this, you will get a lot of videos from the board in action that no other site reviewing that board has been able to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Noise and Temperature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The board is very quiet by default. Even when the fan is activated, you barely hear it, at least under fairly typical conditions. Things change when you push the board to its full power, for example a long compilation time. In such conditions, the fan becomes louder with a woosh kind of sound. You will definitely hear it when doing benchmarks, and in my case, when running LLMs, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of temperature, the control is very good. At 100% usage even for long durations, while the fan becomes clearly noticeable, it maintains the temperature under 60 C (this is winter right now, and the temperature remained at 58 C). Kudos for the good engineering there. It’s as good as the custom cooling solution for my RTX3090.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Power Draw&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t have a way to measure the power draw currently, but based on reports from other publications it looks like we are looking at:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;15W at idle, which is fairly high&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;30+W during usage - this is why they recommend to use the provided PSU with USB-C. Note that any charger that can provide 45W should do the trick as well.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, if you are looking for something that has almost no footprint at idle, this is not it. At idle the OrangePi 5 Ultra consumes more than 3 times less, so that sound more like something you’d use for a server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick run at Geekbench 6 shows a very strong single core score, and an exceptional multi-core score.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the details in single score:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in multi-core where we can see that the OrangePi 6 absolutely crushes what you can find on a Raspberry Pi 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a relatively cheap system that is not going to win the benchmark charts. But look at the results. On single core, we get a score equivalent to a i5-10500 running at a similar frequency (2.3 Ghz).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On multicore this is much more impressive, thanks to its twelve cores. And it gets very close, according to the bench, to what an AMD Ryzen 7 4800H (8 cores) can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is clearly a powerhouse, CPU-wise. For a starting price at 199 USD for the 16GB version, this is a fantastic value proposition. We reviewed the OrangePi 5 Ultra a few months back and the price point is very close (around 160 USD), and unless you need something very small and fanless, the OrangePi 6 Plus is (very clearly) a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Gaming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we have both a fairly powerful SOC, and a working Vulkan driver, this means that we can expect Box64 to do some magic for us there. I compiled Box64 to make it possible to launch Steam, and for some reason there is some Vulkan related error that prevents Steam from launching. Too bad. I still have a GOG account with a few games that have Linux clients. I tried the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Beholder 2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shadow Warrior 2013&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Oxenfree&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Day of the Tentacle Remastered&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Torchlight 2&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with some degree of success! Beholder 2 worked just fine, and are definitely playable on this board, while the framerate remains between the 20s and 30s FPS (here a little slower on this video because of software OBS capture).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s Oxenfree’s Linux x86_64 client running in Full HD on the OrangePi 6 Plus, using Box64:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Torchlight 2 runs nicely too, at something like 20 to 30 FPS in Full HD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shadow Warrior refused to launch, complaining about the graphics drivers not being recent enough (turns out that Zink provides OpenGL support, and there is some issue to detect that the OpenGL version is properly supported… my guess). Day of the Tentacle crashes at start too, not sure why. When games work, the performance is not staggering but convincing for a somewhat small SoC at the end of the day. AMD and Intel are certainly ahead in terms of graphics performance on integrated chips, but they have much larger processors and much more expensive ones, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also tried FOSS games or engines:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GZDoom (compiled from source, the flatpak version sucks in performance!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Luanti (ex-Minetest)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IOQuake3 (compiled from source)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OAD (from Debian repos)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GZDoom works exceptionally well with the OpenGLES renderer at Full HD. It’s fast, responsive. Stable at 60 FPS on Full HD. And Doom is still as fun as it was in the days, or more so if you run Brutal Doom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I don’t have a sample video here, Quake 3 Arena with the IOQuake3 engine works perfectly, and runs at 60 fps on Full HD without a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luanti (ex Minetest) works extremely well - I turned most of the details to the max at 1080p and it kept at a solid 60 FPS. Sure, that’s no AAA game, but it’s a good alternative to Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;0Ad works extremely well, even in full screen at my Ultra Wide screen resolution. I took a video at FUll HD, and while OBS does slow the framerate a little, you can still see it’s very smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;0ad has come a long way, I really need to revisit a recent version of the game to see how much it has changed!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Server use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very capable board that would make a very powerful server. The Debian image comes with Docker, and as we have seen before during the OrangePi 5 Ultra review, the landscape of ready-to-use Docker Hub images is huge and can get you started with numerous server-side applications in no time. Since we have at least 16Gb of memory, very fast I/O (PCIe4!), and a very fast CPU, this SBC will be able to wonders with a wide variety of applications. The only problem is the power draw. It looks like we are stuck with 15W as an idle baseline, and that seems a bit too much for some light server use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;AI applications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This board comes with a very large repository (60 GB!) that you can install and sync automatically, with tons of applications and demos you can try out. There is a large part of their documentation dedicated to that part in their manual. And for what I could try, it seems to work as long as you follow their instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case I like to work with LLMs for a range of applications, so I was interested to see how fast this board could run some small-ish models. One of the major limitations is that we don’t have working NPU support for llama.cpp (oh no!). I was thinking, “no worries, we have a vulkan driver so let’s use Vulkan instead”. I like to be optimistic sometimes. Turns out that the Vulkan driver is below the minimum Vulkan drivers specs required by llama.cpp recently, and I would need to go back to a end 2024 build to be able to compile for Vulkan support. Going back one year on llama.cpp… not an option, sorry (too many models would not be supported going back so far in time). So, we are left with using the raw power of the CPU. Which means it won’t be quiet - expect some good old noise fan in such use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went for Qwen3 1.7b - downloaded the safetensors weights, then converted them to gguf, followed by a quantization step to make them IQ4_S. Running the model at this kind of quantization gives us about 14 tokens per second when doing inference. Definitely usable, very usable even, while this is a small model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally, you’d want to have a board that can run a 7b model with proper hardware acceleration and no fan usage. Not sure if having actual NPU support in the future would help for that or not. In other words, we are not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Existing Alternatives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual there is not a single vendor who can provide you with a CIX experience. This time the main competitor is Radxa, and they have two boards called Orion 6 that feature the same chip - one that is much bigger in footprint (mini-ITX size), and another one that is more similar to the OrangePi 6 Plus size (the Orion 6N). While I don’t have access to the Radxa ones, I can’t comment on how good their support is, but they are very likely to suffer from the same limitations, software wise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As expected, they also only provide a Debian Bookworm image under the Radxa OS nickname so this is no different from what you can get on the OrangePi 6 Plus. Price-wise, they are both available at around similar price points, so you could make you decision based on the best deal you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Verdict&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very impressive SBC, with an exceptional value proposition. Its performance profile puts if far away from the toy category from what we have seen before in the SBC category, and puts it right into the desktop performance realm. It’s still relatively small so you could easily attach it behind a monitor and power a personal computer this way. As a Linux user, things are so fast that you’d be very surprised this is an ARM board running under the hood. For server use, you’d probably want to avoid this one, because of the fairly heavily baseline power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, the pitfalls are always going to be the same. This time around you get an older Debian image (bookworm), with an older kernel (6.6), and some proprietary drivers that you have to live with. Ultimately if you want to upgrade the software running on your SBC that will mean breaking things, and there’s often a fairly long time (if ever) for some hardware components to be supported in newer distros. It’s not necessarily a deal breaker these days. This board is fast enough to compile software fairly quickly if needed. You have Flatpak as well providing some good coverage for a lot of application (even if performance may be sub-par). There are ongoing efforts to mainline the GPU found in the chip, so it could be that a year from now we are in a better place when it comes to proper hardware support beyond kernel 6.6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, this is a surprising new entry in terms of performance / price point. This puts the bar very high for future SBCs ARM64 SBCs. On a personal note, I’d like to see some serious hardware dedicated to running AI models (instead of large desktops chaining multiple GPUs), and maybe highly customized ARM64 SBCs are going to become one option at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in getting one, there are many resellers, but one of the most direct ones are on Aliexpress:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the difference of price between 16 GB and 32GB is so small currently, it would make total sense to go for the 32GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: we were provided with a review unit from OrangePi (more specifically the OrangePi 6 Plus 16GB version).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A colleague of mine shared a story from Windows XP product support. A major computer manufacturer discovered that playing the music video for Janet Jackson’s “Rhythm Nation” would crash certain models of laptops. I would not have wanted to be in the laboratory that they must have set up to investigate this problem. Not an artistic judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One discovery during the investigation is that playing the music video also crashed some of their competitors’ laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then they discovered something extremely weird: Playing the music video on one laptop caused a laptop sitting nearby to crash, even though that other laptop wasn’t playing the video!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s going on?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that the song contained one of the natural resonant frequencies for the model of 5400 rpm laptop hard drives that they and other manufacturers used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The manufacturer worked around the problem by adding a custom filter in the audio pipeline that detected and removed the offending frequencies during audio playback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I’m sure they put a digital version of a “Do not remove” sticker on that audio filter. (Though I’m worried that in the many years since the workaround was added, nobody remembers why it’s there. Hopefully, their laptops are not still carrying this audio filter to protect against damage to a model of hard drive they are no longer using.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course, no story about natural resonant frequencies can pass without a reference to the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940.¹&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related: Shouting in the Datacenter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonus chatter: Video version of this story and a Twitter poll.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, Larry Osterman had a similar experience with a specific game that crashed a prototype PC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Follow-up: Janet Jackson had the power to crash laptop computers, follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;¹ Follow-up 2: Yes, I know that the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse was not the result of resonance, but I felt I had to drop the reference to forestall the “You forgot to mention the Tacoma Narrows Bridge!” comments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"You're taking on a giant. What gives you the audacity?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On November 5th, 2025, Groq CEO Jonathan Ross was asked why he was even bothering to challenge Nvidia. He didn't blink:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I think that was a polite way to ask why in the world are we competing with Nvidia, so we're not. Competition is a waste of money; competition fundamentally means you are taking something someone else is doing and trying to copy it. You're wasting R&amp;amp;D dollars trying to do the exact same thing they've done instead of using them to differentiate."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;49 days later, Nvidia paid $20 billion for Groq's assets and hired Ross along with his entire executive team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except this wasn't actually an acquisition, at least not in the traditional sense. Nvidia paid $20 billion for Groq's IP and people, but explicitly did NOT buy the company. Jensen Huang's statement was surgical: "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That phrasing is the entire story. Because what Nvidia carved out of the deal tells you everything about why this happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forget the AI doomer takes about a bubble forming, lets look into the actual reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Nvidia Actually Bought (And What It Didn't)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia acquired:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All of Groq's intellectual property and patents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-exclusive licensing rights to Groq's inference technology&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jonathan Ross (CEO), Sunny Madra (President), and the entire senior leadership team&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia explicitly did NOT buy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GroqCloud (the cloud infrastructure business)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GroqCloud continues as an independent company under CFO Simon Edwards. This is Nvidia's largest acquisition ever (previous record was Mellanox at $7B in 2019), and they structured it to leave the actual operating business behind. That doesn't happen by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;LPU vs TPU vs CPU: Why SRAM Matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand why Nvidia paid anything for Groq, you need to understand the architectural bet Ross made when he left Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPUs and GPUs are built around external DRAM/HBM (High Bandwidth Memory). Every compute operation requires shuttling data between the processor and off-chip memory. This works fine for general-purpose computing, but for inference workloads, that constant round-trip creates latency and energy overhead. Since GPUs evolved from graphics rendering they're optimized for parallel training workloads and not SEQUENTIAL inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TPUs (Google's Tensor Processing Units) reduce this overhead by passing data directly between processors like an assembly line. But they still rely on external memory (HBM) to store the model. This means the calculations are predictable, but the speed of fetching data from memory is not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LPUs (Groq's Language Processing Units) take a different approach: even larger on-chip SRAM instead of external DRAM/HBM. The entire model (for models that fit) lives in SRAM with 80 TB/s of bandwidth and 230 MB capacity per chip. No off-chip memory bottleneck or dynamic scheduling. The architecture is entirely deterministic from compilation to execution. You know exactly what happens at each cycle on each chip at each moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates massive advantages for inference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Llama 2 7B: 750 tokens/sec (2048 token context)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Llama 2 70B: 300 tokens/sec (4096 token context)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mixtral 8x7B: 480 tokens/sec (4096 token context)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And 10x better energy efficiency because you're not constantly moving data across a memory bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare this to SOTA model tokens/sec throughput on GPU inference&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serious trade off though, only 14GB of SRAM per rack means you can't run Llama 3.1 405B. And LPUs can't train models at all. This is an inference-only architecture with limited model size support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's what makes this interesting: if DRAM/HBM prices continue climbing (DRAM has tripled in a year I should've gone all in DRAM at the start of the year I'm done with indexes), and if inference becomes the dominant AI workload (which it is), SRAM-based architectures become economically compelling despite the size limitations. AND production AI applications seem to be moving from 405B-1T models to running 7B-70B models that need low latency and high throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The $13.1B Premium and the Non-Traditional Structure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq raised $750 million in September 2025 at a post-money valuation of $6.9 billion. Three months later on Xmas Eve, Nvidia paid $20 billion through a "non-exclusive licensing agreement" that acquired all IP and talent while explicitly NOT buying the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just crunched the numbers, that's a $13.1 billion premium (3x the September valuation) for a company valued at 40x target revenue (double Anthropic's recent 20x multiple) with slashed projections (The Information reported Groq cut over $1B from 2025 revenue forecasts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure is the story. Traditional M&amp;amp;A (mergers and acquisitions for those blessed not to have dealt with this crowd) would trigger:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CFIUS review (given Saudi contracts)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Antitrust scrutiny (Nvidia's dominant position)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shareholder votes and disclosure requirements&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-year regulatory review&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-exclusive licensing bypasses all of it. No acquisition means no CFIUS review. "Non-exclusive" means no monopoly concerns (anyone can license Groq's tech). No shareholder votes, minimal disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in practice: Nvidia gets the IP (can integrate before anyone else), the talent (Ross + team can't work for competitors now), and the elimination of GroqCloud (will likely die without IP or leadership). The "non-exclusive" label is legal fiction. When you acquire all the IP and hire everyone who knows how to use it, exclusivity doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question isn't just why Nvidia paid $13.1B more than market rate for technology they could build themselves (they have the PDK, volume, talent, infrastructure, and cash). The question is why they structured it this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where the premium was spent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Regulatory arbitrage: Non-exclusive licensing avoids years of antitrust review. Structure the deal as IP licensing + talent acquisition, and regulators have no grounds to block it. This alone is worth billions in time and certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Neutralizing Meta/Llama: The April 2025 partnership gave Groq distribution to millions of developers. If Llama + Groq became the default open-source inference stack, Nvidia's ecosystem gets commoditized. Kill the partnership before it scales.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Eliminating GroqCloud without inheriting Saudi contracts: Nvidia has invested in other cloud providers (CoreWeave, brev.dev). GroqCloud was a competitor. Traditional acquisition would mean inheriting $1.5B worth of contracts to build AI infrastructure for Saudi Arabia, triggering CFIUS scrutiny. The carve out kills GroqCloud while avoiding geopolitical entanglement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Political access: Chamath makes ~$2B (Social Capital's ~10% stake). Sacks looks good (major AI deal under his watch as AI Czar). Nvidia gets favorable regulatory treatment from the Trump administration. Timing it for Christmas Eve ensures minimal media scrutiny of these connections.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two speculative reasons worth considering:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Blocking Google/Amazon/Microsoft from partnering with Groq: Both are developing custom AI chips (Trainium, Maia). If either had hired Ross + team or licensed Groq's tech, Nvidia's inference dominance faces a real challenger. If Google had acquired Groq and brought Ross back, they'd have the original TPU inventor plus LPU IP.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chiplet integration for future products: Nvidia might integrate LPU as a chiplet alongside GPUs in Blackwell or future architectures. Having Ross's team makes that possible. You can't integrate IP you don't own, and you can't build it without the people who invented it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's how business works when regulation hasn't caught up to structural innovation. Nvidia paid $6.9B for technology and $13.1B to solve everything else using a deal structure that traditional antitrust can't touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Saudi Arabia Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2025, Saudi Arabia committed $1.5 billion to expand Groq's Dammam data center. The publicly stated goal was supporting SDAIA's ALLaM, Saudi Arabia's Arabic large language model. The actual goal was Vision 2030: positioning the Kingdom as an AI superpower. (Wait so its not just about influencer boxing?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq built the region's largest inference cluster in eight days in December 2024. From that Dammam facility, GroqCloud serves "nearly four billion people regionally adjacent to the KSA." This is critical AI infrastructure, funded by the Public Investment Fund, processing inference workloads at national scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Ross in the Series E announcement, Groq powers Humain's services including the Humain chat product and supported OpenAI's GPT-OSS model release in Saudi Arabia. Groq operates 13 facilities across the US, Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. Ross noted that capacity expanded more than 10% in the month before the funding announcement and all of that capacity was already in use. Customers were asking for more capacity than Groq could satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That creates a CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) (I know I know I took a while to unabbreviate it) problem. A U.S. chip company, venture-backed by American investors, building sovereign AI capability for Saudi Arabia. If Nvidia had acquired GroqCloud outright, they would inherit those contracts and the regulatory scrutiny that comes with them. Foreign investment reviews, export control questions, congressional inquiries about why an American company is providing cutting-edge AI to a Middle Eastern monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By carving out GroqCloud, Nvidia gets the technology and the talent without the geopolitical mess. The Saudi contracts stay with Edwards and the independent GroqCloud entity. Clean separation. No CFIUS entanglement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who Actually Gets Paid (And Who Gets Left Behind)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported that "despite the loss of much of its leadership team, Groq said it will continue to operate as an independent company." That's corporate speak for: executives and VCs are cashing out while regular employees watch the company they built get hollowed out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how the $20B probably breaks down (we'll never know the exact numbers since Groq is private and this isn't a traditional acquisition):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who definitely wins:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VCs (Chamath, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom, etc.): They own equity in Groq Inc. Depending on how the deal is structured, they get paid based on their ownership percentage. Social Capital's ~10% stake (after dilution) is worth $1.6-2.4B. BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, and other Series E investors get their cut. They're protected regardless of structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Executives joining Nvidia (Ross, Madra, senior leadership): They get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Retention packages from Nvidia (likely massive given the $20B deal size)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sign-on bonuses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accelerated vesting of any unvested Groq equity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New Nvidia equity compensation packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Their existing Groq equity gets paid out at the $20B valuation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jensen Huang's email to Nvidia staff (obtained by the FT) said they're "adding talented employees to our ranks." When you're talent important enough to be mentioned in a $20B deal, you're getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who might get paid (depending on deal structure):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regular Groq employees with vested equity: This is where it gets murky. There are three possible scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenario 1: The IP licensing fee goes to Groq Inc. If the $20B (or a significant portion) is structured as a licensing fee paid to Groq Inc. for the IP rights, that money gets distributed to all shareholders based on ownership percentage. Employees with vested stock options or RSUs get their pro-rata share. This is the best case for employees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example: Engineer with 0.01% fully vested equity gets $2M ($20B × 0.01%). Not bad for an engineer who's been there since 2018-2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenario 2: Most of the $20B goes to retention packages If the deal is structured so that the bulk of the money goes to retention/hiring packages for Ross, Madra, and the senior team joining Nvidia, with a smaller licensing fee to Groq Inc., employees get less. Maybe the split is $15B retention, $5B licensing fee. Now that same engineer with 0.01% gets $500K instead of $2M.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenario 3: The IP licensing is separate from talent acquisition Nvidia pays Groq Inc. for the IP (say $5-7B, roughly the Sept 2024 valuation), and separately pays Ross + team retention packages directly. Regular employees get their share of the IP licensing fee only. That same engineer might get $500-700K.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The critical question: Is the $20B figure the total cost to Nvidia (including retention packages), or is it just the IP licensing fee? If it's total cost and most goes to retention, regular employees get scammed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who definitely gets done over:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Employees staying at GroqCloud: These are the people who:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Weren't important enough to be hired by Nvidia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have equity tied to GroqCloud's future value&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Just watched their CEO, President, and entire engineering leadership leave&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Are now working for a company with no IP rights, no technical leadership, and no future&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their equity is worthless. GroqCloud will wind down over 12-18 months. They'll either get laid off or jump ship to wherever they can land. They built the LPU architecture, contributed to the compiler stack, supported the infrastructure, and got nothing while Chamath made $2B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The All-In Connection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gets messier when you look at who was involved. Chamath Palihapitiya, through Social Capital, led Groq's initial $10 million investment in 2017 at a $25 million pre-money valuation. Social Capital secured 28.57% of the company and a board seat for Chamath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Sacks, Chamath's co-host on the All-In podcast, became Trump's AI and Crypto Czar in late 2024. In July 2025, Sacks co-authored "America's AI Action Plan," a White House strategy document positioning AI as a matter of national security. The plan called for exporting "the full AI technology stack to all countries willing to join America's AI alliance" while preventing adversarial nations from building independent AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two months later at the All-In Summit in September 2025, Tareq Amin (CEO of HUMAIN, Saudi Arabia's state-backed AI company) presented Groq as "the American AI stack in action." This was seven months after the $1.5B Saudi deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sunny Madra, Groq's President and COO, was actively promoting the All-In narrative during this period. He appeared on the All-In podcast in March 2024 to provide a "Groq update" and joined Sacks on "This Week in Startups" in November 2023. When Anthropic raised AI safety regulation concerns in October 2025, Madra publicly sided with Sacks, suggesting "one company is causing chaos for the entire industry" and echoing Sacks's accusation that Anthropic was engaged in "regulatory capture."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you have Sacks pushing an "America First" AI policy from the White House while Chamath's portfolio company (where Madra is President) is building AI infrastructure for Saudi Arabia. Then Groq gets presented at the All-In Summit as an example of American AI leadership. Three months later, announced on Christmas Eve when media coverage is minimal, Nvidia pays $20 billion to clean up the geopolitical contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chamath walks away with $1.6B to $2.4B. Sacks gets a major AI deal under his watch. Nvidia gets favorable regulatory treatment and eliminates multiple problems. The timing ensures minimal scrutiny of these connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chamath's $2 Billion Win vs. His SPAC Graveyard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After dilution from raising $1.7 billion across Series C, D, and E rounds, Social Capital's stake in Groq was probably 8-12% by the time of the Nvidia deal. At a $20 billion exit, that's $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chamath after using you as exit liquidity and bankrolling it into a 200x win for himself&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do I hate Chamath?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's look at the sh he dumped on retail with his abysmal SPAC track record:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IPOA (Virgin Galactic): -98.5% since inception&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IPOB (Opendoor): -62.9% (was -95% before a brief spike)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IPOC (Clover Health): -74.4%&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IPOE (SoFi): +46% (still underperformed S&amp;amp;P 500's +86%)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chamath personally dumped $213 million of Virgin Galactic stock before it crashed, using PIPE structures that let him exit while retail investors stayed locked up. In October 2025, when launching a new SPAC, he posted a warning telling retail investors not to buy it: "these vehicles are not ideal for most retail investors."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Groq bet was classic venture capital: concentrated bet on an exceptional founder (Jonathan Ross, the engineer who invented Google's TPU) building non-obvious technology. Social Capital's 2017 internal memo projected a "High" exit scenario of $3.2 billion. They landed within range despite dilution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But retail investors never got access to deals like Groq. They got Virgin Galactic. LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;To Conclude&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia paid $20 billion for a company valued at $6.9 billion three months earlier, structured the deal to avoid traditional M&amp;amp;A oversight, killed the cloud business without inheriting Saudi contracts, and enriched the exact people (Chamath, Sacks) who spent the last year promoting "American AI leadership" while cutting deals with foreign governments. The employees who built the technology either got hired by Nvidia or have been utterly shafted.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Windows 2 for the Apricot PC/Xi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(and Word, and Excel, and so much more) by Nina Kalinina, December 27th, 2025 (rev. 1.02 2025-12-27)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought my first Apricot PC about three years ago, when I realised I wanted an 8086-based computer. At the time, I knew nothing about it and simply bought it because it looked rad and the price was low. I had no idea that it was not IBM PC-compatible, and that there were very few programs available for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been on a quest to get a modern-ish word processor and spreadsheet program for it ever since. Which eventually made me "port" Windows 2 on it. In this post, I will tell you the story of this port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a side-quest, I also wrote an article explaining why Windows 2 is kind of awesome. Make sure to check it out, too, if you need more Windows 2 screenshots in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A photograph of a dark grey computer with a CRT monitor - an Apricot PC - running Windows 2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that most of the images in this post were taken from a real green CRT, and thus their quality might vary. You can click the image to load it in full size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you own an Apricot PC, or want to try the port in an emulator, check out the project on sr.ht. You need an Apricot PC, PC/Xi or Xen with at least 512 kB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A few words about the Apricot PC/Xi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want a personal computer today, your general choice is between a "PC" and a "Mac". Back in the 1980s, you would have to choose between dozens or even hundreds of computer architectures, and "PC" was not necessarily the most popular choice for a computer. One of the most promising market contenders, Victor 9000, also known as Sirius 1, was released in 1981. It gained popularity in Europe, creating a niche market for "Sirius-compatible" computers. Two years later, the British company ACT released its Sirius-compatible Apricot PC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A photograph of the main board of Apricot PC/Xi, in the process of being washed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apricot PC is a delightful computer with a great design. Its heart is Intel 8086, the older sibling of the 8088 used in the IBM PC. It uses lovely 3.5" floppy disks; and it is the first Western computer to have a 3.5" drive - before Apple Macintosh. The screen is 9 inches, 800x400 pixels, with great image fidelity. The PC/Xi model comes with a 10 megabyte Winchester hard drive, British-made Rodime RO352, the first-ever 3.5" hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A photograph of the computer's display showing multiple images at once: photographs of computer chips, schematics, and oscilloscope charts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The computer is simple enough to be understood by one person in its entirety (over the course of many months of studying). There are schematics, technical manuals, BIOS reference manuals, and example code available for it, too. Its CPU is supported by Microsoft C, Turbo Pascal, and Open Watcom. It even runs MS-DOS (2.0 to 3.20), though, of course, it cannot run any IBM PC programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of IBM PC-compatibility proved to be fatal for the Apricot. The entirety of its software catalogue is less than 300 megabytes. There is only one graphical game with a soundtrack for it, and it was made in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were, of course, productivity applications for the Apricot, including Microsoft Word for DOS. But among those, only two word processors had a graphical interface: GEM Write and Microsoft Write for Windows 1. Neither were popular; GEM drivers were lost and re-created by John Elliot in 2012 or so. Windows 1 was thought to be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, it should be possible to port a 16-bit Windows to this computer. It would require creating &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM.DRV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DISPLAY.DRV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;KEYBOARD.DRV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MOUSE.DRV&lt;/code&gt;, and ideally &lt;code&gt;COMM.DRV&lt;/code&gt; drivers. But that would be a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Windows 1 Notepad. I didn't have a Windows 1 Write screenshot at hand, but trust me, it looks almost the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where things get interesting. A port of Windows 1 for the Apricot PC (released by ACT in 1987, a year before Windows 2) was miraculously preserved and surfaced online not that long ago. By itself, Windows 1 is unremarkable, as it does not have much useful software. But its driver architecture is not too different from Windows 2, so I thought it might be just about possible to make Windows 2 for the Apricot. And if I could somehow boot Windows 2, I'd be able to run Word, Excel, and Adobe Illustrator on my Apricot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, it only took two and a half years to pull it off!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Porting Windows 2 on the Apricot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Booting, fast and slow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even today, software historians are still arguing whether Windows 2.0 deserves to be called a major Windows update. It added dozens of new kernel features, but it barely changed the driver architecture of the system. The mouse and the keyboard drivers for Windows 2 would work fine on Windows 1, and vice versa. The CGA and EGA video drivers from Windows 1 would allow Windows 2 to boot, but could not render the fonts correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Windows 2 for IBM PC with a broken video driver; all text on the screen is garbled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A natural thing to try would be installing Windows 2 with the Apricot drivers for Windows 1. Except that there are no driver files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you install Windows 1 or 2 on your computer, the SETUP utility combines (links) the driver files with the kernel. It is called "fast boot" and is supposed to improve the boot times of the system. The result of the SETUP is two files, WIN100.BIN and WIN100.OVL. The BIN file is an EXE file in disguise, consisting of the Windows kernel and the system drivers. The OVL file has resources and code that the system uses only from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Windows 1 port of Apricot was only ever distributed with the "fast boot". The individual driver files were not distributed, so we cannot use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The stub drivers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are no drivers, we can make some! Microsoft has a Driver Development Kit for Windows, also known as Windows DDK. The DDK comes with the drivers for the IBM PC, meant to be used as a reference for other platforms. With the help of the DDK, I implemented a stub video driver, and somehow got a stub mouse and system drivers. This was enough to confirm that Windows 2, indeed, can start on the Apricot PC without any patches to the kernel. I had my doubts about that, because Windows 2 comes with EMS memory support, and it might have been using something IBM PC-specific to test for it. Thankfully not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Windows 2 booting in the text mode. The file manager application simply dumps the list of files on the screen, without drawing any windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Trying to write a video driver&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I could expand the drivers to support the Apricot PC. Keyboard, mouse, and even system drivers are small and simple. The real beast of a driver is DISPLAY.DRV, as it has to implement a large subset of the Windows graphical subsystem. With the reference display drivers, this should not be a problem, as long as the video card supports a graphical mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the Apricot PC doesn't have a real graphical mode. It has a 50x25 "graphics screen" with a fake 16x16 font. This is a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A page of the Apricot technical reference explaining the organisation of the Video RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reference video driver from Microsoft makes many bold assumptions about the way video RAM is organised. With the display initialisation routines corrected, the image produced by the reference driver is still undecipherable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of the MAME emulator, running Windows 2 on the Apricot. There are no windows, only stripes of black.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing a driver for such a video card is significantly more painful than designing a VGA-compatible video card for the Apricot. Maybe I return to the Apricot display driver project one day (for the Windows 3.0 port), but for now, I have given up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lose the battle, win the war: re-linking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally, I entertained the idea of unlinking the drivers from the WIN100.BIN/OVL files and reusing them, but rejected it. Not only is it difficult to do, but it is also useless, because the Windows 1 video driver would not display the fonts on the screen under Windows 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when I hit the roadblock with writing the driver from scratch, I got an idea: what if I use a driver from Windows 1 with fonts from Windows 1? Apparently, this trick works! And so, I decided to abandon the video driver writing if I could somehow extract a video driver from the WIN100.BIN/OVL, because I would not need to reverse-engineer it to patch in the font support; it could work out of the box. But how?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The driver files in WIN100 are not "simply concatenated together": some parts from DISPLAY.DRV ends up in WIN100.BIN, and some in WIN100.OVL. Looking closely at those parts, I realised that the part in WIN100.OVL is identical to the Hercules driver. This gave me an idea: I could get a Hercules video driver; then I could extract CODE and DATA segments along with the Entry Table from the WIN100.BIN, and patch them into the Hercules driver. Unfortunately, not a single NE file format tool supported this use-case. I ended up writing my own tool NExus-relink to assist in this process; the tool is still incomplete, but it gave me enough leverage to finish the job manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the video driver, I used a "combine" tool I made for NExus, and then manually patched in the offsets and lengths in the NE header (one for the entry table, two for the segments). Incredibly, this was enough to make Windows 2 happy about the display:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Windows 2 running in the MAME emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same trick worked for the keyboard driver, but the mouse driver gave me a headache. I knew that when the mouse is not found, Windows doesn't display it on the screen, so I kept iterating on the driver, going deeper and deeper. The mouse driver has a relocation table of the OS Fixup type, and there are very few things written about it, so I wasn't sure if the driver was loading correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I confirmed that the interrupt handler of the driver works, and was about to check the kernel source of the corresponding event handler when I discovered that, in fact, the mouse was working fine. It's just that the cursor wasn't displayed on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Windows 1/2, the cursor is handled by the video driver to allow hardware acceleration and "hide cursor before taking a screenshot or drawing a bitmap". So, why is the video driver not drawing the cursor?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows DDK documentation has an answer: the mouse cursor drawing routines in the video driver are called by a timer routine, from the SYSTEM.DRV. I told about this to my fiancée, Atsuko, and she said: "Oh, you didn't notice the cursor wasn't blinking?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out, the timer routines in the SYSTEM.DRV were broken. The SYSTEM.DRV from Windows 1.0 cannot be used with Windows 2, so I implemented the Apricot PC &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM.DRV&lt;/code&gt; using Windows DDK as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this driver complete, I had Windows 2 working on my Apricot PC/Xi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Windows 2 for the Apricot PC: a tour&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome, welcome, let me show you around!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am greeted with the AUG logo when I power up my Apricot. I use the AUG BIOS because it supports the upgraded CPU, NEC V30, much better than the original one. Note that my machine has 896 kB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PC/Xi comes with a single 720 kB floppy drive and a 10 MB hard drive. I have MS-DOS 3.20 installed on the hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have created a file called `win.bat` that simply starts the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to Windows 2. I have GW Basic, Turbo Pascal, Windows 1, Windows 2, Word and Excel installed on the hard drive, and I still have almost 2 megabytes free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PC Paintbrush is one of the few programs that work on both Windows 1 and Windows 2. But it is more stable when running on top of Windows 2. Note that this is not Microsoft Paint **yet**: Microsoft would license this product only for its Windows 3.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to remind you that the screen is monochrome. Pixel dithering works really well on a 100 PPI 800x400 display, creating shades of grey from pixel patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The screen is 4:3, so the pixels are not square. I have to pre-process raster images so they would look right on the Apricot's screen. Vector images are fine, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default shell for Windows 2 is a bit too minimalistic to my taste. WANG's ClearView for Windows 2 brings a familiar to Windows 3 users PROGMAN-like experience to the Apricot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 1 came with tiling windows; Windows 2 uses overlapping windows that quickly become a disorganised mess. ClearView's window manager can arrange the windows for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 2 control panel looks a bit funny in monochrome, but it is a powerful reminder that Windows supports 24-bit colour, which is important for printing and publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A side note: Apricot's keyboard had an LED in the logo before ThinkPad did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MicroScreen and re-programmable keys are fully supported by the Windows keyboard driver. There is no ALT key, so "Close" is as close as we can get to pressing ALT+f4. Note that there is a hotkey for starting the XENTEL telephone accessory. The XENTEL button is somewhat similar to a Copilot button, except it can actually be useful in some situations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Word for Windows. Word for DOS, a completely different program, was first released back in 1983. Word for Windows had its first release in late 1989 due to a non-competition agreement with Apple. The success of Word for Windows made Microsoft abandon Word for DOS and Word for Mac; all the new versions of Word were based on this Word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Word for Windows is surprisingly powerful for a brand-new product. There is a spellchecker, a page layout editor, and even support for macros. I have deleted the macros to save space on the hard drive, so the README file shows "Error!" where the macros were. The files created by Word for Windows 1.0 can be opened by modern office suites if you save as RTF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Excel is a real must-have. There is no other spreadsheet as powerful as Excel on the Apricot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excel for Windows from 1988 looks almost exactly like Excel for Windows from 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My previous trip to Japan was planned between Google Docs and Excel for Windows 2 (I had to convert the file back and forth). I needed a few GB of RAM for Google Docs, and only a few hundred kilobytes for Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excel Help is a hidden gem. It is a hypertext application that feels a lot like a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used the Help application to see how to create a stonks chart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating a stonks chart is surprisingly easy. There are 44 chart types, more than many modern programs offer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until yesterday, Apricot PC had five graphical games: Chess, Where Is The Owl, Windows 1 Reversi, Windows 1 Minesweeper, and Windows 1 Risk. Now there are many more, including a solitaire and a Taipei mahjongg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it! There are many Windows 2 programs I have yet to try on the Apricot, but my quest for running modern-ish Word and Excel for Windows is finally over.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rainbow Six Siege is currently facing a major crisis, with mounting evidence pointing to a large scale hack or exploit, even as Ubisoft continues to describe the situation as a server incident. The disruption has now escalated into full service outages across all platforms, according to Ubisoft’s own service status page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Players across PC and console are being urged by the community to stay offline, as reports continue to surface of accounts receiving billions of in game credits, rare and developer only skins, and experiencing random bans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;BREAKING: Ubisoft Rainbow Six Siege servers have been breached.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Players are reporting massive amounts of R6 Credits, Renown, Alpha Packs, and exclusive items unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Numerous accounts even Ubisoft, including streamers’ and possibly official ones, have received random or… pic.twitter.com/9hGNbBCMAm&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ubisoft Confirms Widespread Outages Across All Platforms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The official service status page for Rainbow Six Siege now shows critical issues across every major platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, core services including authentication, in game store access, and matchmaking are all listed as being in outage, while overall connectivity is marked as degraded. Ubisoft states that issues are being investigated, but has not provided a timeline for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scale of the outages has further fuelled claims that this is far more serious than routine server instability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ubisoft’s Statement Draws Heavy Criticism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier, the official Rainbow Six account acknowledged that it was aware of an incident affecting the game and said teams were working on a resolution. No mention was made of a security breach, hack, or exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re aware of an incident currently affecting Rainbow Six Siege. Our teams are working on a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We will share further updates once available.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;— Rainbow Six Siege X (@Rainbow6Game) December 27, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That wording has been met with heavy backlash from players, many of whom believe Ubisoft is attempting to downplay the severity of the situation. Community responses have accused the publisher of calling it a server issue while core systems appear compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some players also questioned why the game remained online for hours while accounts were being altered in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Players Report Billions of Credits, Dev Skins, and Ban Chaos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the incident unfolded, players reported logging in to find their accounts flooded with billions of R6 Credits and Renown, thousands of Alpha Packs, and access to exclusive cosmetics such as developer skins and Glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Why is nobody talking about what is happening on Siege right now? Everyone that logs in gets 2 Billion R6 credits, Renown, Developer Skins and Glaciers 😭 pic.twitter.com/9SBiLdrirm&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were also widespread claims that the in game ban feed had been taken over, displaying arbitrary messages. Thousands of accounts were reportedly banned and unbanned at random, including those belonging to streamers and high profile players.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prominent Siege creator KingGeorge described the situation as completely broken, warning players not to log in and strongly advising against spending any currency, as it could lead to bans or rollbacks once Ubisoft regains control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Btw as a side note I would not login right now, definitely don’t spend any credits or renown could lead to a ban.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;— KingGeorge (@KingGeorge) December 27, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Community Expects Rollbacks, Fears Punishment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With authentication and account systems affected, many players now expect Ubisoft to roll accounts back to a previous state. However, fears remain that innocent players could still face penalties, especially those who unknowingly spent credits thinking the issue was a visual glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Others argue that banning a significant portion of the active player base would be disastrous, adding further pressure on Ubisoft to handle the aftermath carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of clear communication has only intensified frustration, with players demanding transparency about what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Players Should Do Right Now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until Ubisoft confirms the issue is fully resolved and explains the cause, players are strongly advised to stay offline, avoid logging in, and do not spend any credits or Renown if access is restored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Rainbow Six Siege’s core services offline worldwide and player accounts potentially compromised, this incident could have lasting implications for the game if not handled properly. Ubisoft is expected to provide further updates as its investigation continues.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How We Lost Communication to Entertainment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Ploum on 2025-12-15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;All our communication channels are morphed into content distribution networks. We are more and more entertained but less and less connected.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I did a controversial blog post about Pixelfed hurting the Fediverse. I defended the theory that, in a communication network, you hurt the trust in the whole network if you create clients that arbitrarily drop messages, something that Pixelfed is doing deliberately. It gathered a lot of reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I originally wrote this post, nearly one year ago, I thought that either I was missing something or Dansup, Pixelfed’s creator, was missing it. We could not both be right. But as the reactions piled in on the Fediverse, I realised that such irreconcilable opinions do not arise only from ignorance or oversight. It usually means that both parties have vastly different assumptions about the world. They don’t live in the same world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Two incompatible universes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started to see a pattern in the two kinds of reactions to my blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were people like me, often above 40, who like sending emails and browsing old-fashioned websites. We think of ActivityPub as a "communication protocol" between humans. As such, anything that implies losing messages without feedback is the worst thing that could happen. Not losing messages is the top priority of a communication protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then there are people like Dansup, who believe that ActivityPub is a content consumption protocol. It’s there for entertainment. You create as many accounts as the kinds of media you want to consume. Dansup himself is communicating through a Mastodon account, not a Pixelfed one. Many Pixelfed users also have a Mastodon account, and they never questioned that. They actually want multiple accounts for different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Fediverse threads, nearly all the people defending the Pixelfed philosophy posted from Mastodon accounts. They usually boasted about having both a Mastodon and a Pixelfed account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A multiplicity of accounts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, the very goal of interoperability is not to force you into creating multiple accounts. Big Monopolies have managed to convince people that they need one account on each platform. This was done, on purpose, for purely unethical reasons in order to keep users captive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That brainwash/marketing is so deeply entrenched that most people cannot see an alternative anymore. It looks like a natural law: you need an account on a platform to communicate with someone on that platform. That also explains why most politicians want to "regulate" Facebook or X. They think it is impossible not to be on those platforms. They believe those platforms are "public spaces" while they truly are "private spaces trying to destroy all other public spaces in order to get a monopoly."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People flock to the Fediverse with this philosophy of "one platform, one account", which makes no sense if you truly want to create a federated communication protocol like email or XMPP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Manuel Moreale cracked it for me: the Fediverse is not a communication network. ActivityPub is not a communication protocol. The spec says it: ActivityPub is a protocol to build a "social platform" whose goal is "to deliver content."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The ActivityPub protocol is a decentralised social networking protocol based upon the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format. It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server-to-server API for delivering notifications and content. (official W3C definition of ActivityPub)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No more communication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But aren’t social networks also communication networks? That’s what I thought. That’s how they historically were marketed. That’s what we all believed during the "Arab Spring."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that was a lie. Communication networks are not profitable. Social networks are entertainment platforms, media consumption protocols. Historically, they disguised themselves as communication platforms to attract users and keep them captive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point was never to avoid missing a message sent from a fellow human being. The point was always to fill your time with "content."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We dreamed of decentralised social networks as "email 2.0." They truly are "television 2.0."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are entertainment platforms that delegate media creation to the users themselves the same way Uber replaced taxis by having people drive others in their own car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what was created as "ride-sharing" was in fact a way to 1) destroy competition and 2) make a shittier service while people producing the work were paid less and lost labour rights. It was never about the social!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The lost messages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My own interpretation is that social media users don’t mind losing messages because they were raised on algorithmic platforms that did that all the time. They don’t see the point in trusting a platform because they never experienced a trusted means of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that I write it, it may also explain why instant messaging became the dominant communication medium: because if you don’t receive an immediate answer, you don’t even trust the recipient to have received your messages. In fact, even if the message was received, you don’t even trust the recipient's attention span to remember the message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple studies have confirmed that we don’t remember the vast majority of what we see while doomscrolling. While the "view" was registered to increase statistics, we don’t have the slightest memory of most of that content, even after only a few seconds. It thus makes sense not to consider social media as a means of communication at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no need for a reliable communication protocol if we assume that human brains are not reliable enough to handle asynchronous messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not Dansup who is missing something. It is me who is unadapted to the current society. I understand now that Pixelfed was only following some design decisions and protocol abuses fathered by Mastodon. Pixelfed was my own "gotcha" moment because I never understood Instagram in the first place, and, in my eyes, Pixelfed was no better. But if you take that route, Mastodon is no better than Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many reactions pointed, justly, that other Fediverse tools such as PeerTube, WriteFreely, or Mobilizon were just not displaying messages at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t consider it a big problem because they never pretended to do it in the first place. Nobody uses those tools to follow others. There’s no expectation. Those platforms are "publish only." But this is still a big flaw in the Fediverse! Someone could, using autocompletion, send a message pinging your PeerTube address and you will never see it. Try autocomplete "@ploum" from your Mastodon account and guess which suggestion is the only one that will send me a valid notification!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, I should give credit to Dansup for announcing that Pixelfed will soon allow people to optionally "not drop" text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we lost email&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I cling to asynchronous reliable communications, but those are disappearing. I use email a lot because I see it as a true means of communication: reliable, asynchronous, decentralised, standardised, manageable offline with my own tools. But many people, even barely younger than me, tell me that email is "too formal" or "for old people" or "even worse than social network feeds."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And they are probably right. I like it because I’ve learned to use it. I apply a strong inbox 0 methodology. If I don’t reply or act on your email, it is because I decided not to. I’m actively keeping my inbox clean by sharing only disposable email addresses that I disable once they start to be spammed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for most people, their email inbox is simply one more feed full of bad advertising. They have 4 or 5 digit unread count. They scroll through their inbox like they do through their social media feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Boringness of communications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main problem with reliable communication protocols? It is a mostly solved problem. Build simple websites, read RSS feeds, write emails. Use IRC and XMPP if you truly want real-time communication. Those are working and working great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And because of that, they are boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communications protocols are boring. They don’t give you that well-studied random hit of dopamine. They don’t make you addicted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They don’t make you addicted which means they are not hugely profitable and thus are not advertised. They are not new. They are not as shiny as a new app or a new random chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem with communication protocols was never the protocol part. It’s the communication part. A few sad humans never wanted to communicate in the first place and managed to become billionaires by convincing the rest of mankind that being entertained is better than communicating with other humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;As long as I’m not alone&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that a communication network must reach a critical mass to be really useful. People stay on Facebook to "stay in touch with the majority." I don’t believe that lie anymore. I’m falling back to good old mailing lists. I’m reading the Web and Gemini while offline through Offpunk. I also handle my emails asynchronously while offline.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;There Is No Content on Gemini (ploum.net)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I may be part of an endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter. I made peace with the fact that I will never get in touch with everyone. As long as there are people posting on their gemlogs or blogs with RSS feeds, as long as there are people willing to read my emails without automatically summarising them, there will be a place for those who want to simply communicate. A protected reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;NHS England is rolling out software to run our health records from Palantir – a US spy-tech firm that has supported mass deportation in the US and enabled genocide in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One of Palantir’s founders is also openly against the NHS. Peter Thiel claimed it “makes people sick” and said that the British people love the NHS because we’re suffering from Stockholm syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We can’t let a company like this take control of our healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But we can fight back right now. We’ve set up a simple tool so you can find out if your local NHS trust has started using the software, and then send an email demanding they say no to Palantir.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With the government putting NHS trusts under pressure to adopt the software, we need to act right now. If you want to keep Palantir out of our NHS, send an email to your local trust and Wes Streeting, secretary of state for health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the biopharma industry’s marvels of the 2020s has been the enormous medical and financial success of the GLP-1 class of drugs. But the path to commercialization of these therapies was far more complex than most understand, and some of the earliest history has never been presented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1988, I was part of what I believe was the earliest commercial effort to develop GLP-1 as a metabolic therapy. Despite extremely promising results, Pfizer, the major funder of the work in alliance with California Biotechnology, abandoned the effort around 1991 after mistakenly concluding that the GLP-1 therapeutic approach was not worth continuing. To be clear, I’m not writing this to claim credit for discovery or development of GLP-1s or anything like that. Rather, I think the story offers valuable lessons on drug development for pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and the general public alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1987, John Baxter — a professor of medicine at UCSF, leader in molecular endocrinology, and founder of a biotech firm named California Biotechnology — asked me to work with him to create a start-up focused on metabolic disease, and I enthusiastically agreed. I enlisted two Harvard colleagues, Ron Kahn and Bruce Spiegelman, and together we outlined an approach that included a search for novel insulin analogues and insulin sensitizing agents, identifying the protein responsible for obesity in genetically obese mice (six years before identification of the ob gene), and exploration of gut factors regulating metabolism, such as the “incretins” that enhanced insulin secretion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2026, thousands of copyrighted works from 1930 enter the US public domain, along with sound recordings from 1925. They will be free for all to copy, share, and build upon.[3] The literary highlights range from William Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying to Agatha Christie’s The Murder at the Vicarage and the first four Nancy Drew novels. From cartoons and comic strips, the characters Betty Boop, Pluto (originally named Rover), and Blondie and Dagwood made their first appearances. Films from the year featured Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, the Marx Brothers, and John Wayne in his first leading role. Among the public domain compositions are I Got Rhythm, Georgia on My Mind, and Dream a Little Dream of Me. We are also celebrating paintings from Piet Mondrian and Paul Klee. Below you can find lists of some of the most notable books, characters, comics, and cartoons, films, songs, sound recordings, and art entering the public domain.[4] After each of them, we have provided an analysis of their significance. At the end of the article, we explain:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just a small selection from the thousands of books and plays entering the public domain in 2026. The famous works include modernist masterpieces, detective stories, a science-fiction classic, an early self-help book, and a seminal work on psychoanalysis. All of them and thousands more will be copyright-free in the US. The newly public domain corpus also includes a wealth of children’s and young adult fiction—the first four Nancy Drew books, the introduction of the characters Dick and Jane, a Newbery Award winner about the life of The Buddha, and the popular illustrated version of The Little Engine That Could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Works from 1930 are not only enriching the public domain; they also illustrate its value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I have an idea that the only thing which makes it possible to regard this world we live in without disgust is the beauty which now and then men create out of the chaos. The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books they write, and the lives they lead. Of all these the richest in beauty is the beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art.” –W. Somerset Maugham&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is a quote from W. Somerset Maugham, whose novel Cakes and Ale is entering the public domain in 2026. But artists don’t merely create “beauty…out of the chaos,” though our current moment has lots of the latter. They create beauty by drawing on our shared culture. Look at Maugham’s title: “Cakes and Ale.” Maugham himself was referring to a classic public domain work, in this case Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night. “Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?” says Sir Toby Belch reprovingly to his pompous Puritan steward Malvolio, who is always eager to judge the behavior of others. Maugham reuses the line precisely to make the same point about puritanical moralizing and, in the case of his novel, artistic hypocrisy. The narrator is disgusted by the snobbery and judgmental attitudes of his contemporaries towards Rosie Driffield, a former barmaid who became the wife of a famous fictional novelist. Rosie came from a working-class background and was forthright, without pretension, and sexually free. She is now decried for those qualities, but the narrator finds her far more impressive than the bourgeois scolds who disdain her. The title reaches back 330 years to show that one of our greatest playwrights was mocking faux puritanism in exactly the same way. Maugham's point is that the human race relives those moments and emotions in every era; the desire to moralize is always with us. Now his work is in the public domain and we, too, can reuse his insights and artistry to create new art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same point holds true for many of the other works entering the public domain this year. The title of Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying came from Homer’s Odyssey. The public domain contains far more than works with expired copyrights—names, titles, and very short phrases are not copyrightable standing alone and are therefore public domain in the US; one does not have to wait for the expiration of the copyright term. But when works enter the public domain, the artistic freedom granted over them is far greater. Plot, characters, images, vignettes; all can now be mined for future inspiration. And that, too, was true in the past just as it is now. The tale of the tenacious little engine that pulls the train over the mountain had been circulating in various forms before the Watty Piper version, or the predecessor it credits.[5] To tell new stories, we draw from older ones. One work of art inspires another – that is how the public domain feeds creativity. Why care about the public domain? That is one reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;CHARACTERS, COMICS, CARTOONS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Betty Boop from Fleischer Studios' Dizzy Dishes and other cartoons&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rover (later renamed Pluto) from Disney's The Chain Gang (as an unnamed bloodhound) and The Picnic (as Rover)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Blondie and Dagwood from the Blondie comic strips by Chic Young&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flip the Frog from Fiddlesticks and other cartoons, by Ub Iwerks after he left Disney&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nine new Mickey Mouse cartoons, the initial week of Mickey Mouse comic strips, and ten new Silly Symphonies cartoons from Disney&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Betty Boop was introduced in the Fleischer Studios’ wonderful cartoon Dizzy Dishes, set in a restaurant full of anthropomorphic animals. She is instantly recognizable, with the familiar flapper girl appearance, pouting lips, enormous doe eyes, tiny button nose, and kiss-curls. She even sings her high-pitched “Boop Oop A Doop” tagline—but in a characteristic Fleischer touch of surrealism she has elongated dog ears (similar in shape to her later hoop earrings) and facial expressions that morph between human and animalistic. Betty’s boyfriend-to-be is a dog-chef called Bimbo, who serenades her on a duck that transforms into a guitar, while the restaurant clientele and staff include a fantastical menagerie of animals. The vibe is decidedly trippy: duck-guitars, lovestruck dog-chefs, dancing flapper cats, and needy gorillas. Betty is remarkably sexy. But, because she was designed as a girlfriend for Bimbo, she also has dog ears. The dissonance fits the setting. By contrast, Disney’s character Rover, later renamed Pluto, inhabits a world in The Picnic that is both cuter and more normal—Rover licks Mickey with unbridled enthusiasm, chases rabbits, and provides Mickey and Minnie with comedic canine companionship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contrast between the Fleischer and Disney aesthetics is fascinating. Max Fleischer once said, “If it can be done in real life, it isn’t animation.” Dizzy Dishes certainly does not disappoint. As described by the late Charles Silver, who ran MoMA’s Film Study Center, “Disney was based in Los Angeles and reflected the ‘wholesome’ mid-American values of Uncle Walt’s Kansas City roots. Fleischer’s New York product was more sophisticated and cosmopolitan…Broadly speaking, there was an innocence in Disney’s view of the world, while Fleischer projected an underlying kinkiness.” Our colleague Casey Herbert, who teaches cartoon history at Duke, put it this way: “Max and Dave Fleischer’s characters were drawn from the urban environment they knew so well. Vaudeville, dance-halls, diners, drinking and drugs were routinely part of the hallucinogenic mayhem…On the other hand, Walt, his brother Roy, and best friend Ub Iwerks, the core of the early Disney enterprises, all had roots in rural middle America. With upbeat music and clever solutions, mechanical and animal troubles of all sorts were resolved with a simple, can-do attitude that Mickey and his pals exude.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As more of Disney’s and Fleischer’s classic works enter the public domain, it is worth reflecting on how deeply their styles are embedded in the DNA of today’s animation. Now, entering 2026, we look back and think it inevitable that one genre of cartoons will be cutesy and folksy, with slapstick humor and an upbeat vibe, while another will use the unparalleled artistic freedom afforded by the cartoon medium to explore a distinctly more surreal worldview, sensual and trippy, with wild nightlife and mind-bending transformations. Looking back to 1930, we can find the progenitors of both, and see how the traditions began to diverge. Indeed, it is striking how “edgily modern” some of the Fleischer cartoons feel. To look into each year’s newly public domain crop is to open a time-capsule that offers fresh insights about our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with Mickey Mouse, Popeye, and Winnie-the-Pooh, it is the original 1930 iterations of Betty Boop and Rover/Pluto that are entering the public domain. Newer, different versions of the characters are still copyrighted, and trademark rights still cover the character names and designs when they are used on merchandise as brand signifiers. The rules are complex and explored in more detail here, with their application to Betty Boop discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the other highlights from 1930 are additional Mickey Mouse comic strips and cartoons, in which the famous mouse continues to develop, and the comic strip Blondie, featuring early versions of Blondie and Dagwood. In 1930 they are not yet married, and Dagwood has not yet discovered his signature sandwich.[6] Blondie’s maiden name is Boopadoop—similar to Betty Boop’s scat-singing catchphrase, which in turn echoed the phrase associated with the singer and actress Helen Kane and has been traced back to the African-American jazz performer “Baby” Esther Lee Jones. (Kane actually sued the Fleischers for appropriating the phrase, along with her persona and singing style. In response, the Fleischers claimed that Kane had copied those attributes from Esther Jones. The judge ruled against Kane. Based on the reports we can find, the accuracy of the specific claims and counterclaims is unclear, but accounts of Boop's creation indicate that the character was based at least partly on Kane.)[7]&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Whoopee!, directed by Thornton Freeland&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;War films, musicals, thrillers, Westerns, comedies, surrealist satires—this year’s newly public domain films run the gamut. They feature familiar actors: Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, John Wayne, the Marx Brothers, and the film debut of Moe Howard and Larry Fine, who would later be long-running members of The Three Stooges. There are also familiar names among the directors and writers: Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hughes, and even Rube Goldberg and Salvador Dalí.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These films predated the enactment of the 1934-1968 “Hays Code” that censored profanity, criminal activity, “indecent” dance costumes, and sexual content such as “excessive and lustful kissing, lustful embraces, suggestive postures and gestures.” In Morocco, Marlene Dietrich, handsomely dressed in a top hat and tails, famously kisses another woman. King of Jazz features the sequence “I Like to Do Things For You,” described on Wikipedia as “humorously sadomasochistic.” Pre-Code Betty Boop was overtly seductive. As critic Gabrielle Bellot wrote: “On the one hand, Betty Boop was a creation of the heterosexual male gaze, with an endless parade of lecherous male characters trying to see under her skirt, yet on the other hand she wore power like a light shawl, her image an in-your-face depiction of unashamed sexuality.”[8] Post-Code Betty Boop covered her shoulders and garter. As with Maugham’s Rosie from Cakes and Ale, frank female sexuality was not to be tolerated. Malvolio would have liked the Hays Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the scenes from these films are eerily resonant today. In King of Jazz, a man gets drunk and stammers: “You know what’s the matter with this country? It’s a tariff! That’s who!”, referring to the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act that deepened the Great Depression. Today, there is a lot of debate about whether the public knows enough about the importance of the rule of law and the protections of due process. At the end of Animal Crackers, Groucho and Chico Marx (as Captain Spaulding and Ravelli) have this exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groucho: “We go to court and get a writ of habeas corpus.”&lt;lb/&gt; Chico: “You gonna get rid of what?”&lt;lb/&gt; Groucho: “Haven’t you ever heard of habeas corpus?”&lt;lb/&gt; Chico: “No, but I’ve heard of ‘Habie’s Irish Rose’.”&lt;lb/&gt; Groucho sighs in exasperation and walks away&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Faulkner, the author whose novel begins this year’s list of books, wrote: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cimarron is featured even though it was released in 1931 because it was copyrighted in 1930 and the earlier date controls (date discrepancies are resolved “in favor of the public”). Please note that only the original films from 1930 are public domain; later versions might have newly added material that is still copyrighted. If a film has been restored or reconstructed, only original and creative additions are eligible for copyright; if a restoration faithfully mimics the preexisting film, it does not contain newly copyrightable material. Putting skill, labor, and money into a project is not enough to qualify it for copyright, and the Supreme Court has made clear that “the sine qua non of copyright is originality.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about the music in the films? We are in the era when “talkies” – movies with sound – were new. As with other works, the statutory copyright terms for this music began either upon “publication” or copyright registration. If musical works were previously unpublished or unregistered and first appeared in a film from 1930, the general rule is that the music was published along with the film and is also public domain in 2026. (The same is true of the "sounds accompanying a motion picture," discussed below.) In other circumstances, however, a film and its underlying music may have different copyright terms. If a song was copyrighted separately before the film, for example, the song would have entered the public domain earlier than the film, after its own 95-year term. Conversely, if the copyright in the song was renewed while the copyright in the film was not, the song remained copyrighted after the film went into the public domain. This happened with It’s A Wonderful Life (1946)—the movie’s copyright was not renewed but the soundtrack’s copyright was, so the movie was public domain while the soundtrack and underlying short story were not. But if musical works made their first appearance in a film and the film rights were renewed, then the prevailing view is that the movie and music enter the public domain at the same time.[9]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;MUSICAL COMPOSITIONS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Four Songs - I Got Rhythm, I've Got a Crush on You, But Not for Me, and Embraceable You - with lyrics by Ira Gershwin, music by George Gershwin&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Georgia on My Mind, lyrics by Stuart Gorrell, music by Hoagy Carmichael&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dream a Little Dream of Me, lyrics by Gus Kahn, music by Fabian Andre and Wilbur Schwandt&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight, lyrics by Al Lewis, music by Al Sherman&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On the Sunny Side of the Street, lyrics by Dorothy Fields, music by Jimmy McHugh&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It Happened in Monterey, lyrics by Billy Rose, music by Mabel Wayne&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Body and Soul, lyrics by Edward Heyman, Robert Sour, Frank Eyton, music by Johnny Green&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Just a Gigolo (the first English translation), original German lyrics by Julius Brammer, English translation by Irving Caesar, music by Leonello Casucci&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You're Driving Me Crazy, lyrics and music by Walter Donaldson&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Beyond the Blue Horizon, lyrics by Leo Robin, music by Richard A. Whiting and W. Franke Harling (possible inspiration for the Star Trek theme song)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Royal Welch Fusiliers, by John Philip Sousa&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1930 brought us enduring jazz standards and popular songs. From George and Ira Gershwin came I Got Rhythm, the source of the foundational jazz chord progression known as the “rhythm changes,” and But Not for Me, memorably featured in the film When Harry Met Sally (RIP Rob Reiner). You might still find yourself humming the classics Georgia on My Mind and Dream a Little Dream of Me today. Just A Gigolo offered an early, melancholy take on the proverbial player who’s “gonna play, play, play.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only the musical compositions—the music and lyrics that you might see on a piece of sheet music—are entering the public domain, not the recordings of those songs, which are covered by a separate copyright with a different term of protection. The lyrics and music to Georgia on My Mind and Livin’ in the Sunlight, Lovin’ in the Moonlight were published in 1930 and will be free for anyone to copy, perform, record, adapt, or interpolate into their own song.[10] But the later recordings by Ray Charles and by Tiny Tim are still copyrighted. (Readers may remember the Tiny Tim recording from the first episode of SpongeBob SquarePants—that episode had to be omitted from the first season DVD because the rights were not cleared with Tiny Tim’s estate.) Sound recording rights are more limited than composition rights, however. You can legally imitate a sound recording – should you be able to channel Tiny Tim’s signature falsetto – even if your imitation sounds exactly the same, you just cannot copy from the actual recording.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calculating the copyright term for these early songs can be tricky. Under the law at the time, the copyright clock only started ticking when songs were published in sheet music form, not merely released as recordings. Even though Mood Indigo came out in 1930, the sheet music was not published until 1931, so it will not be in the public domain until 2027. If works were registered for copyright and published in different years, the earlier date controls. So copyright lapses over Dream a Little Dream of Me in 2026 because its copyright was registered in 1930, even though it was not published until 1931.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;SOUND RECORDINGS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen, recorded by Marian Anderson&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yes Sir, That's My Baby, recorded by Gene Austin&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sweet Georgia Brown, recorded by Ben Bernie and His Hotel Roosevelt Orchestra&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You've Been A Good Old Wagon, recorded by Bessie Smith&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The St. Louis Blues, recorded by Bessie Smith, featuring Louis Armstrong&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fascinating Rhythm, recorded by the Paul Whiteman Orchestra&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I'll See You in My Dreams, recorded by Isham Jones, with Ray Miller’s Orchestra&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Everybody Loves My Baby (but My Baby Don't Love Nobody but Me), recorded by Clarence Williams’ Blue Five&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If I Lose, Let me Lose (Mama Don't Mind), recorded by Louis Armstrong, Fletcher Henderson, and Maggie Jones&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Cup of Coffee, A Sandwich and You, recorded by the Carleton Terrace Orchestra&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manhattan, recorded by The Knickerbockers (Ben Selvin and his Orchestra)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the 2018 Music Modernization Act, recordings from 1925 will be open for legal reuse after the conclusion of a 100-year term. There are some incredible performances: the civil rights icon Marian Anderson singing Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen in her haunting contralto, and The St. Louis Blues recorded by Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong. Only the 1925 recordings made by these artists are entering the public domain, not their later recordings. To listen to old recordings, you can go to the Library of Congress National Jukebox.[11]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sound recordings within a movie are treated differently from separate sound recordings because copyright law’s definition of “sound recording” specifically excludes “sounds accompanying a motion picture.” So the 1930 recordings as they appeared in the film King of Jazz have the same copyright term as the movie and are public domain in 2026, while regular sound recordings from 1930 that were independent of motion pictures have the 100-year term and their copyrights won’t expire until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ART&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Piet Mondrian, Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Abel Lafleur, the Jules Rimet Cup (the original trophy of the FIFA World Cup, also known as the Victory Trophy or Coupe du Monde)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edward Steichen, Fashion for Vogue, October 27, 1930&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Paul Klee, Tierfreundschaft (Animal Friendship)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;José Clemente Orozco, Prometheus&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Composition of Circles and Overlapping Angles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Theo Van Doesburg, Simultaneous Counter-Composition&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copyright will also expire in 2026 over works of art that were published or registered in 1930, reflecting artistic movements ranging from Art Deco to Constructivism and Neoplasticism. In the traumatic years of World War I, Paul Klee wrote that “the more horrifying this world becomes, the more art becomes abstract.” Artists such as Klee, Mondrian, Taeuber-Arp, and van Doesburg abstracted the world around them: stylizing, simplifying, flattening, and deconstructing. But the artists on our list also include José Clemente Orozco, whose intensely realistic Prometheus was described by Jackson Pollock as “the greatest painting in North America,” and Edward Steichen, who went on to revolutionize minimalism in commercial fashion photography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Determining the copyright status of older artworks is challenging. They are only public domain in 2026 if they were “published” as defined by copyright law in 1930, and it is often unclear when exactly publication occurred.[12] The rules are murky and “published” is a legal term of art that was not well-defined. Generally the law looks at whether the art was genuinely released to the public by being exhibited without restrictions on copying, circulated in a magazine or catalogue with authorization, or offered for sale to the public. If it was created but remained only in the artist’s studio or shown only to a limited group, this did not count. But artistic records from almost 100 years ago are difficult to find. Our tireless research assistant Jason Rosenberg spent months contacting experts and combing through exhibition catalogues, museum archives, journals, catalogue raisonnés, provenance indexes, auction records, and biographies to confirm whether the highlighted works were published in 1930.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are other legal wrinkles too. Works by US artists had to comply with copyright “formalities,” including initial publication with a copyright notice and renewal after 28 years, to enjoy the full 95-year term. This is why American Gothic – which is from 1930 – is not on our list; it was by an American artist, Grant Wood, and entered the public domain in 1958 when its copyright was not renewed. Foreign authors such as Mondrian and Klee are treated differently—because of a 1996 provision that restored copyright over certain foreign works, they are eligible for the full term without notice or renewal. For such authors, the question is whether their works were actually “published” in 1930.[13]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may see reports that the Chrysler building is entering the public domain in 2026 because it was constructed in 1930. The building was reportedly scrubbed from the 2023 Spider-Man 2 video game because of a copyright claim. However, there is no legal basis for such a claim. US copyright law only covers buildings created on or after December 1, 1990, when protection was first extended to architectural works. And even with newer copyrighted buildings, the law allows “pictorial representations of the work, if the building in which the work is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place.” So if the Spider-Man story is true, it would be an example of copyright overreach or overly cautious avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a short video celebrating the works entering the public domain in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep reading to learn more about the public domain! You can use the links below to jump to the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why celebrate the public domain?&lt;lb/&gt; How do copyright and trademark law apply to characters?&lt;lb/&gt; What is the impact of the long copyright term?&lt;lb/&gt; What are the basic rules for determining whether something is public domain?&lt;lb/&gt; Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;WHY CELEBRATE THE PUBLIC DOMAIN&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When works go into the public domain, they can legally be shared, without permission or fee. Community theaters can screen the films. Youth orchestras can perform the music publicly, without paying licensing fees. Online repositories such as the Internet Archive, HathiTrust, Google Books, and the New York Public Library can make works fully available online. This helps enable both access to and preservation of cultural materials that might otherwise be lost to history. 1930 was a long time ago and the vast majority of works from that year are not commercially available. You couldn’t buy them, or even find them, if you wanted. When they enter the public domain in 2026, anyone can rescue them from obscurity and make them available, where we can all discover, enjoy, and breathe new life into them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The public domain is also a wellspring for creativity. You could think of it as the yin to copyright’s yang. Copyright law gives authors important rights that encourage creativity and distribution—this is a very good thing. But the United States Constitution requires that those rights last only for a “limited time,” so that when they expire, works go into the public domain, where future authors can legally build on the past—reimagining the books, making them into films, adapting the songs and movies. That’s a good thing too! It is part of copyright’s ecosystem. The point of copyright is to promote creativity, and the public domain plays a central role in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court explained: “The copyright term is limited so that the public will not be permanently deprived of the fruits of an artist’s labors.” To quote Justice Joseph Story, this benefits the public by “admitting the people at large, after a short interval, to the full possession and enjoyment of all writings . . . without restraint.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the public domain feed creativity? Here are just a few current illustrations. In 2025 you may have enjoyed Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein, derived from Mary Shelley’s novel, or Wicked: For Good, derived from L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Perhaps you are looking forward to Christopher Nolan’s forthcoming epic IMAX version of The Odyssey, Wuthering Heights starring Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw, or Lear Rex, a new version of King Lear starring Al Pacino as Lear. The Great Gatsby entered the public domain in 2021 and has already spawned a number of creative reworkings. 2025 saw others join them. We had The Gatsby Gambit, The Great Mann, Local Heavens, and Mrs. Wilson's Affair: A Great Gatsby Retelling. Clearly, this is a public domain work on which today's novelists have been feasting. Shakespeare, Dickens, and Austen continue to spawn adaptations too, including a reimagining of Hamlet in present-day London, A Far Better Thing (A Tale of Two Cities with fairy changelings), and The Season of Dragons (Pride and Prejudice and dragons). We haven't yet read it, but very much hope it contains the line, "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single dragon in possession of a good hoard of treasure, must be in want of a wife."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The works we are celebrating from 1930 also illustrate how the public domain nurtures creativity. Once again, a fine exemplar is Disney, whose beloved works, from Snow White and Cinderella to The Jungle Book and Sleeping Beauty, have consistently built upon the public domain. That was as true in 1930 as it is today. The Mickey Mouse cartoons from 1930 made ingenious reuse of public domain music. Here are some of the public domain songs from these works: Morning, Night and Noon in Vienna by Franz von Suppé (1844), the William Tell Overture by Gioachino Rossini (1829), Orphée aux Enfers by Jacques Offenbach (1858), A Hunting We Will Go by Thomas Arne (1777), Oh Susanna and Old Folks at Home/Swanee River by Stephen Foster (1848, 1851), The Farmer in the Dell (1820s) and Pop Goes the Weasel (1850s) (traditionals), and a tune known as the Snake Charmer Song (1840s). All of these compositions date from before 1880, when the maximum copyright term was 42 years, and could be freely used in 1930 animations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes people worry that entry into the public domain could mean the desecration of a beloved character or plot. Yes, inevitably there will be those who capitalize on public domain status to make deliberately shocking content—the slasher movie based on Winnie the Pooh comes to mind, or the low-budget horror films featuring Mickey Mouse. Works like that may even generate outrage—that is their whole marketing plan! But will they be remembered? We have always been able to make slasher or porn versions of Shakespeare, yet I am guessing that the Shakespearean adaptations you remember are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (from Hamlet, RIP Tom Stoppard), West Side Story (from Romeo and Juliet), Forbidden Planet (from The Tempest), or 10 Things I Hate About You (from The Taming of the Shrew). From the serious to the whimsical, these are public domain reuses with more enduring appeal. Far from dimming the luster of the original works, they have allowed their legacy to live on. The best reason not to care about the merely shocking use of public domain works, without an underlying artistic point, is that they tend not to stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This point is true far beyond Shakespeare. Think of all the other films, cartoons, books, plays, musicals, video games, songs, and other works based on Greek mythology, on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, or on the works of Austen and Dickens. The Odyssey inspired not only the upcoming Christopher Nolan epic and the title of As I Lay Dying, but also centuries of other remakes—The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Ulysses, and the Coen brothers’ O Brother Where Art Thou, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that the public domain extends beyond works whose copyrights have expired. Some material is born in the public domain. Ideas, facts, and raw data can never be copyrighted. The public domain also includes official works of the US government such as legislation, legal opinions, and even NASA images. The images from the James Webb telescope, the NASA collections NASA on The Commons (flickr) and NASA image and video library, the famous “Earthrise” photograph taken by astronaut William Anders, and the Farm Security Administration - Office of War Information Photograph Collection (a pictorial record of American life from 1935-1944 that includes Dorothea Lange's powerful photograph "Migrant Mother," one of the enduring images of the Great Depression) are all copyright-free. Another category of public domain material consists of works that creators choose to dedicate to the public domain, and many have done so using Creative Commons’ CC0 tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HOW DO COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK LAW APPLY TO CHARACTERS?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Mickey Mouse 1.0 went into the public domain in 2024, he joined a host of other public domain characters—Winnie-the-Pooh, Sherlock Holmes, Snow White, Cinderella, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, Robin Hood, Santa Claus, and the Wonderful Wizard of Oz characters, to name a few. This year, we get the first versions of Betty Boop and Pluto (originally named Rover) and new iterations of Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Looking ahead, an exciting new cast of characters will become public domain in the coming years: the initial appearance of Goofy in 2028 (originally named Dippy Dawg), Donald Duck in 2030, Superman in 2034, Batman in 2035, Tom and Jerry and Bugs Bunny in 2036, and Wonder Woman in 2037.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-running characters such as Betty Boop and Mickey Mouse are subject to both expired and enduring rights. This creates a fascinating checkerboard of material that is free and still owned. The overall result is a layered mosaic of public domain and copyrighted character attributes. Here is a summary, with the legal rules spelled out in more detail afterward and applied to Betty Boop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning with Mickey Mouse as a concrete example, dozens of iterations of the mouse fall into each of the categories above. In the top left quadrant, we will have 24 Mickey cartoons (from 1928-1930) and 6 comic strips (1930) that have entered the public domain due to copyright expiration after the full term. At the top right, there are also non-renewed cartoons and over a thousand additional comic strips just from 1930-1935 that appear to be public domain due to non-renewal. And in the bottom row, there are decades of still-copyrighted works, as well as continuing trademark rights for the use of Mickey’s image on various Disney products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The non-renewed works in the top right quadrant present an additional legal twist. The only aspects that became public domain upon non-renewal were their new features, not material derived from earlier works that remained in-copyright. The chronology of owned and free in such works is inverted. The new is free; the old may be subject to copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is how this nuance plays out in one Mickey story without a renewed copyright—the 1934 tale of Rumplewatt the Giant. This story introduces a gnome village from which the titular giant steals a golden goose. After Mickey defeats the giant, the butterfly who initially flew him to the castle morphs into Princess Minnie. As a reward for his valiance, she agrees to marry Mickey. So far as we can tell, these elements were newly introduced in the 1934 comic. If this is correct, they are in the public domain due to non-renewal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Rumplewatt the Giant derived many of its elements from the still-copyrighted cartoon Giantland (1933). These include a sequence where Mickey hides in a sugar-cube jar and ends up in the giant’s coffee cup, and a bit where Mickey uses pepper to make the giant sneeze. Assuming these were original to Giantland, they are still copyrighted. Even though they reappear in the non-renewed comic, they are not in the public domain because they originated in a work that is still under copyright. Finally, both works share basic “ideas” that are uncopyrightable and were always in the public domain—these include the generic “hero fights a giant and defeats him” plot line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;BETTY BOOP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Betty Boop provides another illustration. As Betty Boop 1.0 enters the public domain, this is an opportunity to celebrate and appreciate Max and Dave Fleischers’ unparalleled artistry and pioneering animation. While Fleischer Studios may not be as well-known to the general public as Disney, perhaps they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that Boop’s initial appearances from 1930 are public domain in 2026. There are also dozens of post-1930 Betty Boop cartoons that have long been public domain due to non-renewal. And there are many still-copyrighted works featuring Boop, plus trademark rights over her name and depiction for certain products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleischer Studios has posted a statement called “Fact Check 2026: Is Betty Boop in the Public Domain?". It begins with "this year Betty Boop appeared on a number of [public domain] lists, claiming that she will enter the public domain on January 1, 2026, which is actually not true" and elaborates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the copyright in the ‘Dizzy Dishes’ cartoon may fall into the public domain in 2026, this does not affect Fleischer Studios’ copyright in the fully developed BETTY BOOP character Fleischer Studios created in subsequent cartoons and other uses and continues to use today. Fleischer Studios’ copyright in that character will therefore remain in force for some years to come, as will Fleischer Studios’ copyrights in the many subsequently revised and modern versions of the BETTY BOOP character and related elements. Equally important, the BETTY BOOP name and various related character designs are well-known and valuable Fleischer Studios trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is interesting because while Fleischer Studios does own continuing trademark rights over Betty Boop (discussed below), its claim to copyright over the fully developed character is less clear. In fact, in 2011, an appeals court definitively held that Fleischer did not own the copyright in the Boop character.[14] The original Fleischer Studios had gone out of business and sold off its rights in the 1940s. The current Fleischer Studios, “a distinct and separate entity,” had later tried to buy back those rights. The only issue before the court was whether Fleischer owned the familiar Boop character. The court ruled that, because “the chain of title is broken,” it did not. (Beside the text you can see, from the court exhibits, two versions of Boop that Fleischer did not then own. As you can see, they are more “modern” than the 1930 Boop with her subtle dog ears.) Perhaps Fleischer has since reacquired some of those rights, or perhaps they only have the rights over newly added features from the “subsequent cartoons and other uses” they mention. In the latter case, those rights would be narrow and would not extend to the underlying Boop character at issue in the 2011 decision. One thing is clear: regardless of who owns the later versions of the character, the original Betty Boop character from 1930 is in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your head is spinning from all the complexities involved here, congratulations! You are in good company. This is another reason why copyright expiration is so important: It brings clarity. There can be multiple separate copyrights implicated in a single creative work – over characters, audiovisual content, music, and so on. During a copyright term that lasts almost 100 years, those multiple rights may have changed hands many times and may no longer be owned by a single entity, or indeed by any entity we can identify. It can be incredibly difficult to figure out who owns what. When entire works become public domain, they are free for reuse without having to untangle this web of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, now that Betty Boop 1.0 is public domain, the ownership and chain of title questions are immaterial. She, at least, is copyright-free. That brings us to another set of questions: What features of the newer, copyrighted Boop characters are still subject to exclusive ownership, and what is free to the public? Expanding on the checkerboard above, here are more specifics about the legal rules, and how they apply to Betty Boop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;EXPIRED AND SUBSISTING COPYRIGHTS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We begin with the left column on the checkboard above. When the copyright expires over a creative work, the characters within that work enter the public domain, and you can use them in new works without permission or fee. What if those characters also appear in more recent works that remain copyrighted?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, under US copyright law, anyone is free to use characters as they appeared in public domain works. If those characters recur in later works that are still under copyright, the rights only extend to the newly added material in those works, not the underlying material from the public domain works—that content remains freely available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, with newer versions of characters, copyright only extends to those new features that qualify for such protection. The features must be “original, creative expression,” meaning that they were independently created (as opposed to copied from somewhere else) and possess at least a modicum of creativity. Mere “ideas” such as generic character traits are not copyrightable. Nor are “merely trivial” or “minuscule” variations added to the original characters. It is not enough for the new material to be different; it has to meet copyright’s threshold requirements for protectability. In addition, using commonplace elements that have become standard or indispensable (copyright law calls these “scènes à faire”) is not infringement.[15] Finally, if your use qualifies as “fair use,” for example if you make a scathing parody that significantly transforms the original work, the copyright owner has no right to stop you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From what we have said so far, you can see that even when a work is still under copyright, the rightsholder’s control is not absolute. Here is a serendipitous example. In Nichols v. Universal (1930), the author of the play Abie’s Irish Rose (mentioned above as part of the Marx Brothers’ pun) sued the producers of a popular movie for copyright infringement, claiming appropriation of her characters and plot. The judge rejected this claim, invoking as an example Shakespeare’s Sir Toby Belch from Twelfth Night, the source of W. Somerset Maugham’s Cakes and Ale title highlighted earlier. The judge wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Twelfth Night were copyrighted, it is quite possible that a second comer might so closely imitate Sir Toby Belch or Malvolio as to infringe, but it would not be enough that for one of his characters he cast a riotous knight who kept wassail to the discomfort of the household, or a vain and foppish steward who became amorous of his mistress. These would be no more than Shakespeare’s “ideas” in the play, as little capable of monopoly as Einstein’s Doctrine of Relativity, or Darwin’s theory of the Origin of Species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applying this to Abie’s Irish Rose, the judge explained why copying two lovers from the play would not be infringement: “The lovers are so faintly indicated as to be no more than stage properties. They are loving and fertile; that is really all that can be said of them, and anyone else is quite within his rights if he puts loving and fertile lovers in a play of his own, wherever he gets the cue.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do these legal rules apply to Betty Boop? BOOP! the Musical was made when the character was still under copyright. Permission needed to be obtained. What if you wanted to make your own different Betty Boop musical in 2026, now that Boop 1.0 is in the public domain?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of Boop’s features from the 1930 cartoons are public domain in 2026. In her first appearance in Dizzy Dishes, she has the familiar flapper girl appearance and dance moves, and sings variations of “Boop Oop a Doop” to the besotted Bimbo character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Betty Boop is in the public domain, along with the lyrics, plot, and incredible animation. So are the Boops from other 1930 cartoons (to the left, Barnacle Bill and Mysterious Mose). However, those are not the only parts of the character in the public domain. Some of her features were not copyrightable from the beginning, because they were copied from elsewhere. Her general appearance and “Boop Oop A Doop” catchphrase were inspired by the Jazz Age flapper girl archetype, as embodied by celebrities such as Helen Kane.[16] It was the way those came together into a captivating new character that was copyrighted and is now entering the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is how Betty Boop developed over time, from Fleischer Studios' "Becoming Betty Boop" website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What features of newer Betty Boops are copyrightable? While copyright still covers the overall post-1930 depictions of Boop, it does not extend to unoriginal, “merely trivial,” or stereotypical modifications of Boop 1.0, such as replacing the dog ears with human ones, dressing her in standard attire for a cabaret performer or homemaker, adding a Rosie the Riveter bandana, or modulating her voice to reflect newer singing styles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We went through this same process two years ago with Mickey Mouse. Mickey 1.0 did not have red shorts or speak in a high-pitched voice; those traits were added in later, still-copyrighted works. When the original Mickey became public domain, we were asked by many reporters whether creators could color his shorts red or have him talk in a falsetto. Are those variations, standing alone, copyrightable? Does choosing a single, bright, primary color for an article of clothing, or giving an animated mouse a squeaky voice (given that mice actually squeak), meet the copyrightability threshold? We would say no, but reasonable people could disagree on exactly where the line is to be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us be clear: None of this detracts from the astounding creativity in the Fleischer cartoons—they are some of the most innovative cartoons we have ever seen! The later works contain a wealth of copyright-eligible material such as plot lines, dialogue, and new characters. But with any creative work – as the quote about Twelfth Night demonstrates – there are also uncopyrightable building blocks that remain free for future creators. The challenge is to separate the copyrightable wheat from the uncopyrightable chaff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;NON-RENEWED COPYRIGHTS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now turn to the top right quadrant in the checkerboard—the plot thickens when we add works that are also in the public domain due to non-renewal. Under early copyright law, copyrights lapsed after 28 years if they were not renewed. Dozens of post-1930 Betty Boop cartoons, including Ker-Choo (1932) and Poor Cinderella (1934), did not have renewals.[17] The newly added material in these animations is also in the public domain. As mentioned earlier, however, the material derived from still-copyrighted Boop animations is not.[18]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To sum up the copyright story so far: in 2026, the underlying Betty Boop character goes into the public domain. She is joined there by the attributes, plot lines, and dialogue that were first introduced in those later cartoons without renewed copyrights, as well as the uncopyrightable attributes of her later instantiations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;WHAT IF THE CHARACTER IS NO LONGER COPYRIGHTED, BUT ITS NAME OR IMAGE IS STILL SUBJECT TO TRADEMARK RIGHTS?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We finish with the bottom right quadrant: trademarks. You may encounter claims that even though Betty Boop 1.0 is copyright-free in 2026, you still cannot use the character in new creative works because it is trademarked by Fleischer Studios. But this is not what the law actually says. While Fleischer’s trademark rights over Betty Boop are unaffected by her entry into the copyright public domain, those rights are limited. Trademark law only prohibits the use of a trademarked character if doing so “is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive” consumers about the source or sponsorship of a new product.[19] Here is a brief summary of the relevant law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trademark rights are designed to prevent consumer confusion in the marketplace. They are not supposed to interfere with artistic expression that doesn’t create such confusion. Trademark law does not prevent you from using a public domain character’s name or image in a new creative work so long as consumers are not likely to be misled into thinking that your work is produced or sponsored by the trademark holder. In addition, the law has special rules that allow creators to use other people’s trademarks in artistic works without liability.[20]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trademarks do not override copyright law.The Supreme Court has made clear that trademark rights cannot be used to block the freedoms that the expiration of copyright allows, such as using a public domain character in a book or movie.[21]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;→ Therefore, trademark rights do not prevent you from using the 1930 Betty Boop character in a new creative work unless consumers will be confused into thinking it is a Fleischer-sponsored product.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is the précis; here is the expanded version for those who are interested. Copyrights and trademarks are different. Copyrights cover creative works and prevent people from copying and adapting them without permission, with the goal of providing economic incentives to create and distribute cultural material. The US Constitution requires that these rights expire after a “limited time,” so that the public and future creators can have unfettered access to creative works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trademarks cover words, logos, images, and other signifiers that serve as brands identifying the source of a product. The goal is to minimize consumer confusion in the marketplace. Nike can prevent other producers of athletic apparel from putting “Nike” or a swoosh on their merchandise so that when purchasers see those indicators, they know they are getting a Nike product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike copyrights, trademarks do not automatically expire. They can last as long as a mark is still being “used in commerce.” While trademarks can outlast copyrights, however, the rights themselves are more circumscribed. It is only trademark infringement if an unauthorized use is likely to create consumer confusion about a product’s source or sponsorship. Non-confusing uses are not prohibited, and there are a variety of legal safeguards for uses of trademarks in connection with expressive works such as films, books, and songs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes copyrights and trademarks overlap. A character such as Betty Boop might be covered both by copyright law (as a creative work) and trademark law (as an indicator of product-source). What happens when the copyright expires and the trademark is ongoing? In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court made clear that trademarks cannot be used to make an end run around copyright law because this would “create a species of mutant copyright law that limits the public’s federal right to copy and to use expired copyrights.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have been careful to caution against misuse or overextension of trademark and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by . . . copyright.” Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox (Supreme Court 2003)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, trademark rights cannot be used to block the freedoms that the expiration of copyright allows, such as using a public domain character in a new creative work. Along the same lines, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explained that when a work enters the public domain “[w]e all own it now,” and trademark law “cannot be used to circumvent copyright law. If material covered by copyright law has passed into the public domain, it cannot then be protected by the Lanham Act [the federal trademark statute] without rendering the Copyright Act a nullity.”[22]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, you can use a character’s name or image in a new creative work so long as consumers do not think that your work is produced or sponsored by the trademark holder. Those who tell you otherwise are mistaken.[23] One way to help dispel potential confusion is to make clear the actual source of the work – you or your company – on the title screen or cover, along with a prominent disclaimer indicating that your work is not produced, sponsored, endorsed, licensed, or approved by the trademark owner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleischer owns trademark rights to the words “Betty Boop” and “Boop” for products such as live musical theater performances and clothing. It also has trademarks over Betty Boop designs such as the one depicted here for a range of merchandise including jewelry, wallets, back packs, drinking glasses, plastic water bottles, clothing, and dolls. (As noted by the Ninth Circuit appeals court in the case rejecting Fleischer’s copyright claim, it turns out that Boop merchandise is extremely popular, even appearing in the most surprising locations: “This merchandise has reached such a high level of popularity that even drug dealers have been known to use it. See United States v. Lakoskey, 462 F.3d 965, 971 (8th Cir. 2006) (‘A search warrant was issued, and the package was opened pursuant to that warrant on January 26, 2004. The package contained a large ceramic Betty Boop doll, with four concealed, separately wrapped plastic bundles of high-purity-level methamphetamine inside’).”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleischer’s trademark rights are for uses of “Betty Boop,” “Boop,” and her image, but only in connection with particular specified products. Fleischer does not own the simple word “Boop,” unconnected to Betty. Other companies have federally registered “Boop” as a trademark for coffee mugs and pet stores. Trademarks do not convey ownership of a word. “Popeye” the sailor cartoons coexist happily with the unconnected “Popeyes” chicken and biscuits. Dove soap does not infringe Dove chocolate. Delta faucets and Delta airlines legally use the same brand name for different goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result of all of these points is that Fleischer Studios cannot use trademark law to interfere with the production of a new creative work featuring the Betty Boop 1.0 character when it is clear that the new work is not a Fleischer-sponsored production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here it is important to distinguish between different uses of the Boop character. Certainly, there would be a risk of consumer confusion if you use Betty Boop as a brand identifier on the kind of merchandise Fleischer sells—jewelry, back packs, water bottles, dolls. Trademark law does protect Fleischer against that risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrast these uses with simply putting the Boop character in a new artistic work. This is exactly what copyright expiration is intended to allow. Were trademark law to prevent this, then trademark rights would be leveraged to obtain the effective equivalent of a perpetual copyright—precisely what the Supreme Court said we cannot do. You can also use the trademarked terms “Betty Boop” or “Boop” in connection with the new work featuring that character. As one court explained:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When a public domain work is copied, along with its title, there is little likelihood of confusion when even the most minimal steps are taken to distinguish the publisher of the original from that of the copy. The public is receiving just what it believes it is receiving—the work with which the title has become associated. The public is not only unharmed, it is unconfused.”[24]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If courts have delineated the line between copyright and trademark, why is there so little clarity in this area? Sadly, companies sometimes claim to have more expansive rights than they actually do, capitalizing on fear, uncertainty, and doubt to collect royalties and licensing fees to which they are not legally entitled. This is deeply regrettable. It interferes with the rights of everyone from the small community theater trying to screen a public domain movie, and being told they still have to pay licensing fees, to new creators trying to make a new work from a public domain character but facing baseless threats that they are infringing. In the process, it fundamentally misstates the law in a way that confuses the public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When such overbroad claims have actually gone to court, they have been dismissed, sometimes harshly. In 2023 we covered the Sherlock Holmes saga. The ingenious detective and his faithful sidekick Dr. Watson had been in the public domain for a long time. But that did not stop Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. from demanding licensing fees. Most people simply paid up. But when Leslie Klinger, a lawyer and Sherlock Holmes scholar, fought back, a court decisively confirmed that all of the elements in the out-of-copyright Sherlock Holmes stories are “free for public use.” The estate appealed, in a move that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals described as bordering on the “frivolous” and “quixotic.” The appeals court affirmed Klinger’s right to use the Holmes and Watson characters and awarded him attorney’s fees. Judge Richard Posner called out the estate’s “unlawful business strategy”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Doyle estate’s business strategy is plain: charge a modest license fee for which there is no legal basis, in the hope that the “rational” writer or publisher asked for the fee will pay it rather than incur a greater cost, in legal expenses, in challenging the legality of the demand…only Klinger (so far as we know) resisted. In effect he was a private attorney general, combating a disreputable business practice — a form of extortion…It’s time the estate, in its own self-interest, changed its business model. Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate (7th Cir. 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us hope that 2026 does not see more of this type of disreputable legal overreach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE LONG COPYRIGHT TERM?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For copyrighted culture, the public domain arrives only after a long wait. Works from 1930 were first set to go into the public domain after a 56-year term in 1986, but a term extension pushed that date to 2006. They were then supposed to go into the public domain in 2006, after being copyrighted for 75 years. But before this could happen, Congress hit a 20-year pause button and extended their copyright term to 95 years. Now the wait is over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The works featured above are famous; that is why we included them. Their copyright holders benefitted from 20 more years of copyright because the works were still earning royalties. But they are just the tip of the iceberg. When Congress extended the copyright term for these works, it also did so for all of the works whose commercial viability had long lapsed. For the vast majority—probably 99%—of works from 1930, no copyright holder financially benefited from continued copyright. Yet they remained off limits, for no good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Congressional Research Service report indicated that only around 2% of copyrights between 55 and 75 years old retain commercial value. After 75 years, that percentage is even lower. Most older works are “orphan works,” where the copyright owner cannot be found at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why a former head of our Copyright Office concluded that adding an extra 20 years to the US copyright term was a “big mistake.” Indeed, there is a consensus among policymakers, economists, and academics that lengthy copyright extensions impose costs that far outweigh their benefits. Why? The benefits are minuscule—economists (including five Nobel laureates) have shown that term extension does not spur additional creativity. At the same time, it causes enormous harm, locking away millions of older works that are no longer generating any revenue for the copyright holders. Films have disintegrated because preservationists can’t digitize them. The works of historians and journalists are incomplete. Artists find their cultural heritage off limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The public domain enables the rediscovery and reuse of works that might otherwise be forgotten. Empirical studies have shown that public domain books are less expensive, available in more editions and formats, and more likely to be in print—see here, here, and here. The works highlighted above are just a tiny snapshot of what will be copyright-free. Many more are waiting to be found and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the arrival of works into the public domain is cause for celebration, the length of the copyright term means that even though works from 1930 are legally available, this does always not mean they are actually available. Many films from the era have been lost forever. Noteworthy lost or mostly lost films from 1930 include the sound version of John Ford’s Men Without Women and The Gorilla.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that works from 1930 are legally available also does not mean that rights holders won't continue to claim copyright over them. The previous section mentioned what an appeals judge called the "disreputable business practice" of charging "license fee[s] for which there is no legal basis." Yet rights holders continue to claim copyright over public domain properties. Lloyd Entertainment has told small community theaters that, unless the pay licensing fees, they cannot screen Safety Last! – a silent film that went into the public domain in 2019 – even when the theaters are using their own music and thought they were playing public domain prints. Lloyd claims that no public domain versions of the film exist because all available copies have been restored. Not all restorations have new copyrights, however. As mentioned earlier, if a film has been restored, only original and creative additions are eligible for copyright. If the restoration faithfully mimics the preexisting film, it does not contain newly copyrightable material and can be screened just like the public domain version. Many restorations contain new copyrightable material, but is it possible that every surviving print of Lloyd's movies is both restored, and sufficiently creatively changed to acquire a new copyright? The fact that this is in doubt underscores the problem with the long copyright term: after nearly a century, works may be legally available, but it is difficult to find original versions. Harold Lloyd was brilliant and the rights holders to his films enjoyed 95 years of copyright exclusivity. But when that term expires, theaters should be able to screen the films—this is exactly what the public domain is supposed to allow. It is disappointing to know that rights holders are targeting people who are merely trying to show films to fans, out of love and respect for the art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To take a similar example, the owners of the rights to Charlie Chaplin’s films have been sending aggressive letters to small theaters telling them that they cannot screen Chaplin films that are legally in the public domain. The letters contain assertions about US copyright law that are, to use the technical term, bogus. To be sure, Chaplin was a genius and his successors have legitimate rights over his still-copyrighted films. But they do not have the right to squelch activities that are entirely legal. As Judge Posner commented earlier, falsely claiming an entitlement to licensing fees over public domain works can be "a form of extortion."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chaplin Office nevertheless claims that the 1925 film The Gold Rush cannot be screened because the copyright in the underlying screenplay does not expire until 70 years after Chaplin’s death, or the end of 2047, because Chaplin was British and his copyright was restored under special rules for works by foreign authors. (They focus on the screenplay because the film entered the public domain in 1953 due to non-renewal of its copyright.) Even if this copyright restoration met the law's requirements (it does not appear to) there is a more basic mistake in their calculation: they cite to the wrong provision of US copyright law, §303, for the life + 70 term, ignoring that it is only for works that were “created but not published or copyrighted before January 1, 1978.” The Copyright Office records show that the screenplay was copyrighted in 1925, and for such works the law states that the copyright lasts for “the remainder of the term of copyright that the work would have otherwise been granted in the United States,” which is 95 years under §304 of the Copyright Act, making the work public domain in 2021. Case closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;WHAT ARE THE BASIC RULES FOR DETERMINING WHETHER SOMETHING IS PUBLIC DOMAIN?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How long does copyright last in the United States? The 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act gave works published or registered before 1978 a 95-year term, expiring on January 1 after the conclusion of the 95th year. Doing the math, you add 96 years to the publication date. Works from 1930 were copyrighted for 95 years—through 2025—and are in the public domain January 1, 2026. This year's featured works are in the public domain because of either a 1930 registration or publication with a 1930 copyright notice. We were also able to track down the renewal data indicating that they are still in-copyright through the end of 2025 and entering the public domain in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Works published before 1978 had to meet certain requirements to be eligible for the full 95-year term—they had to be published with a copyright notice, and works from before 1964 also had to have their copyrights renewed after an initial 28-year term. Works published from 1978 through 3/1/1989 without a notice had to register their copyrights within five years to fix the lack of copyright notice. This means that many works published after 1930 might technically be in the public domain. However, as a practical matter, users sometimes have to assume they’re still copyrighted (or risk a lawsuit) because the relevant copyright information is difficult to find. We do not have clear and comprehensive records of copyright ownership and older records can be fragmentary, confused, or lost. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the concept of "publication" is important and has a special meaning under copyright law. It refers to when the work was sold or distributed to the general public with the authority of the copyright owner. Determining whether and when publication occurred can be complicated and vary depending on the kind of work—with music from before 1978, for example, the distribution of recordings of a song did not publish the song.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For pre-1978 works that were never published or registered, the term is different: life-plus-70 years for works by natural persons, and 120 years from creation for works of corporate authorship. In this category, works created by people who died in 1955 are in the public domain in 2026. Newer works created since 1978 are also treated differently from those published before 1978. Works by natural persons from 1978 forward have a life-plus-70 term, while works of corporate authorship are copyrighted for 95 years after publication. This is the copyright term for works created today, and there are no longer notice or renewal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about foreign works? Some countries have a life-plus-50 term and many others, including EU countries, have a life-plus-70-year term, even for the older works that have the 95-year term in the US. This means that works might be copyrighted in one country and copyright-free in another. For example, W. Somerset Maugham’s Cakes and Ale enters the US public domain in 2026 but is still copyrighted elsewhere until 2036, because the author died in 1965. In life-plus-70 jurisdictions, works from authors who died in 1955 are public domain this year, so they are celebrating a different set of works on Public Domain Day. How do you know which law applies to you? As a general matter, courts have said that users are governed by the law in the jurisdiction where they are using the creative work. But this inquiry can be more complicated and depend on the circumstances surrounding the use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the US, many foreign works from 1930 are copyrighted until 2026 because of a provision that, in 1996, restored copyright over certain foreign works that had fallen into the US public domain because of non-compliance with notice or renewal requirements. This restored term applies to many of the foreign works we are highlighting. You can learn more about how this functions from the Copyright Office's circular Copyright Restoration Under the URAA. If the owners of copyright in foreign works filed a Notice of Intent to Enforce their restored copyright you can find that information here. You can also find copyright restoration records through the Copyright Office’s search portal here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rumor Alert! You may see inaccurate claims online that all works by non-US authors such as Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, or Hergé are not entering the US public domain because they are subject to a life + 70 copyright term. This is not true. The 1996 provision that restored US copyright over qualifying foreign works is clear that their copyrights last for “the remainder of the term of copyright that the work would have otherwise been granted in the United States.” For foreign works that were published or copyrighted in 1930 – such as the ones we highlight – this term is 95 years, and they enter the public domain in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the copyright term for sound recordings? The Music Modernization Act’s “Classics Protection and Access Act” established a timeline for old recordings to enter the public domain. Recordings first published between 1923–1946 are public domain in January 2024–2047 (the year after a 100-year term). Then there is a ten-year pause from 2048–2058. After that, recordings first published between 1947–1956 are public domain in January 2058–2067, after a 110-year term. The term for all remaining recordings first fixed from 1957 until February 15, 1972 ends on February 15, 2067. Note that the term of protection for sound recordings in other countries is different from the one in the US: in the EU it is 70 years, and elsewhere it is 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year’s entrants into the public domain are a wonderful group—enthralling, and deeply entertaining. Whatever your artistic interest, they have some delicious “cakes and ale” for you. Malvolio would disapprove. But they also offer us something deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Language and art were once domains that humans thought solely our own. Generative AI has forced us to re-articulate our conception of art and the creative process; to focus on the subjective experience behind the work, not just the pretty patterns manifested within it. In that context, it is fascinating to reflect on these works from 1930. What leaps out at you is the humanity behind them—the wit, the stylistic innovation, the stories being told in the shadow of World War I and in the midst of the Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These authors were producing meaning from lived experience, not just replicating patterns. Their artistic output is not merely a snapshot of our culture at a moment in time or an entertaining postcard from the past. It is a record of the lives they lived, the emotions they felt, and the art they made as a result of it. It gives new meaning to the Somerset Maugham quote with which we began this essay, speaking of the beauty that artists sometimes create out of chaos. “The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books they write, and the lives they lead. Of all these the richest in beauty is the beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art.” In the age of AI, those words seem to offer us a luminous insight.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[2] Our featured works are only entering the public domain under US copyright law. The copyright term for older works is different in other countries. In the EU, works from authors who died in 1955 are going into the public domain in 2026 after a life-plus-70 year term. As a general matter, under the principle of lex loci delicti, users are governed by the law in the jurisdiction where they are using the creative work. See Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v. Russian Kurier, Inc. (2d Cir. 1998). But this inquiry can be complicated and fact-specific, and governing law will depend on the circumstances of the use in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[3] Even though a work is still in-copyright, you may legally use it in certain ways if your activity qualifies for copyright’s “fair use” exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[4] To find more material from 1930, you can visit the Catalogue of Copyright Entries. In the US, only the author’s works from 1930 and earlier are in the public domain, not all of the other work published by that author. With regard to newly copyright-free works, only the original versions published in 1930 are entering the US public domain. Later versions of them—adaptations, movies, or translations—may still be copyrighted. However the later copyright only covers newly added creative material. The original content from the 1930 work remains free. As you look through these works from 1930, please note that they offer a temporal cross section of our cultural past, capturing the era in its complexity. Unfortunately many of the works from 1930 contain racist and sexist stereotypes and demeaning language. When such works enter the public domain, anyone is free to critique and remake them, even if doing so goes beyond what would be allowed under copyright’s fair use doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[5] Arnold Munk credited a book called “The Pony Engine” (1916) but later faced an unsuccessful claim that he took the story from Frances Ford who had written a similar story in 1910. For fascinating research into the stories that led up to Munk’s version, see Roy Plotnick, “In Search of Watty Piper: The History of the ‘Little Engine’ Story,” New Review of Children’s Literature and Librarianship, 18:11-26 (2012).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[6] We found "King Features Weekly" copyright renewals from 1935 that may cover the first appearance of Dagwood’s sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[7] Peter Benjaminson, The Life and Times of Betty Boop: The 100-Year History of an Animated Icon (Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2023), p17: “Early one morning in 1930, Dave Fleischer told animator Grim Natwick to design a girl dog who would costar with Bimbo in a cartoon to be titled ‘Dizzy Dishes.’ Natwick was told that the new character, as yet unnamed, would be singing a ‘boop-oop-a-doop’ song similar to those sung by Helen Kane. Fleischer also handed Natwick a picture of Kane.” The lyrics from the song that Boop sings in Dizzy Dishes are from “I Have to Have You,” performed by Helen Kane in a film the year before. Animation Resources recounts similar origins in this biography of Grim Natwick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[8] You can find Bellot’s quote and a more in-depth analysis of the Betty Boop character before and after the Hays Code in Emily Wishingrad, “The Evolution of Betty Boop”, Smithsonian Magazine (March 9, 2022). Bellot further explained that "[Betty Boop] was a stereotype, yet she also defied stereotypes of what female cartoon characters could do onscreen. In The Life and Times of Betty Boop, Peter Benjaminson writes: “Betty is the only classic female comic character who isn’t someone’s wife, girlfriend, or regular employee. Unlike Olive Oyl, Blondie, and other cartoon women, Betty’s not defined by her relationship to a male character…She’s her own woman, known for herself, and not just because she belongs to some man.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[9] Here is additional information on the question of when musical compositions were “published” under early copyright law. We know that they were published when copies of sheet music were sold, and were not published if they were merely distributed as sound recordings. But what if the music first appeared in a movie? While courts have offered inconsistent interpretations of the law, the leading copyright treatise explains that the “general rule” is that publication of a movie also publishes the previously unpublished works incorporated within the movie, such as music and screenplays. 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 4.12. Cases following this rule include Shoptalk, Ltd. v. Concorde-New Horizons Corp. (2d Cir. 1999), Batjac Prods. Inc. v. GoodTimes Home Video Corp (9th Cir. 1998) and Maljack Prods. Inc. v. UAV Corp. (C.D. Cal. 1997). The logic is that publication of the film necessarily entails publication of its constituent parts. See Classic Film Museum, Inc. v. Warner Bros., Inc. (D.Me.1978) (“It is impossible to cleave the story, screenplay and musical score of a motion picture film from the film itself”; holding that non-renewal of the original 1937 film A Star Is Born “dedicated the film in its entirety [including the script and musical score] to the public use”). If the film’s owners complied with the legal requirements for the full 95-year copyright term, the owners of the underlying material in the film received that protection as well. When the term expires, the motion picture and its component parts become public domain, allowing use of the composite film.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Copyright Office agrees with this interpretation. In a 1975 review of the 1909 Copyright Act, which governed works from 1930, it explained: “On the basis of a thorough legal review and analysis of the status of motion picture soundtracks under the copyright statute, the Copyright Office has concluded that under the prevailing judicial view, copyright in a motion picture extends to an integrated sound track and its copyrightable component parts.” 37 C.F.R. § 202.15 (1975). Accordingly, under the 1909 Act, “[t]he U.S. Copyright Office considers a motion picture to be a unitary work in which the component parts are integral to the work as a whole.” Copyright Office Compendium § 2122.6(C). This remains true under today’s copyright law: “Where music is first published in a motion picture soundtrack, the motion picture is considered a copy of the musical work.” Copyright Office Compendium § 802.4(C).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are cases that departed from this general rule, but they did so in a different context. See Richlin v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Inc. (9th Cir. 2008); TCA TV Corp. v. McCollum (2d Cir. 2016). These decisions did not afford the works embodied in a film the full copyright term, so that the composite entered the public domain after 95 years. Instead, they did the opposite, and said that the owners of such underlying works forfeited their copyrights because they could not benefit from the film owners’ compliance with copyright formalities. Criticizing this “harsh construction” of the law, Professor Nimmer invokes a scenario relevant to this discussion: “the fact that a songwriter may separately register her work for protection does not prove that her failure to separately register the work forfeits all protection in it—the possibility remains that she could rely on the registration of the work in which the song appears to vindicate her rights in that song.” After these rights expire, both the film and song go into the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The popular songs in King of Jazz were copyrighted separately from the film and either entered the public domain before 2026, as with My Bridal Veil (1920), Rhapsody in Blue (1924), Mississippi Mud (1927), and The Bluebirds and the Blackbirds Got Together (1929), or are from 1930 and are becoming public domain along with the film—these include A Bench in the Park, The Song of the Dawn, Happy Feet, I Like to Do Things for You, It Happened in Monterey, Ragamuffin Romeo, and Music Has Charms (all from 1930).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[10] Note that US copyright law allows you to cover a song without permission while it is still copyrighted under the “compulsory license” in §115, so long as you do not “change the basic melody or fundamental character” of the original song and pay a pre-set royalty rate. When a song is in the public domain you can make covers without complying with this provision, and you can also make other adaptations, performances, and interpolations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[11] The Music Modernization Act sets a timeline for older recordings to enter the public domain, and also has provisions allowing people to legally make noncommercial uses of still-copyrighted recordings that are no longer being commercially exploited. Older recordings contain a wealth of history; not just music but spoken word, radio broadcasts, oral histories. A lot of this material has faded into obscurity and is of interest primarily to scholars and hobbyists. But, like old films, old audio lives on a fragile substrate—many vintage formats deteriorate over time, to the point where they literally disintegrate, or it is impossible to play them again. Congress therefore included carveouts in the law to try and ensure that this history can be digitized and preserved for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[12] For never-published, never-registered works, the term is life + 70 years.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[14] In the 2011 case Fleischer Studios v. A.V.E.L.A., the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Fleischer Studios was not the owner of the copyright to the Betty Boop character. The original Fleischer Studios sold those rights away and was dissolved in the 1940s. The rights in the Betty Boop character were carved out from the rights in the cartoons and the separate sets of rights were eventually transferred to different companies. Later the Fleischer heirs formed a new Fleischer Studios – “a distinct and separate entity from the now defunct Original Fleischer which first owned Betty Boop” – and tried to buy back the copyright to the Betty Boop character. There was a complicated chain of title: “Original Fleischer transferred its rights to Paramount Pictures, Inc. (Paramount) in 1941; Paramount transferred those rights to UM &amp;amp; M TV Corp. (UM &amp;amp; M) in 1955; in 1958, UM &amp;amp; M transferred these rights to National Telefilm Associates, Inc. (NTA), which became Republic Pictures in 1986; and finally, Republic Pictures transferred the exclusive copyright to Fleischer in 1997.” The problem? There is a broken link in the chain: “it is clear that Paramount did not transfer the copyright to the Betty Boop character to UM &amp;amp; M.” Because the copyright was kept by Paramount, rather than transferred to UM &amp;amp; M, UM &amp;amp; M could not transfer it down the line to Fleischer. Something could have happened since this 2011 decision – for example, Fleischer could have regained rights directly from Paramount – but we cannot find anything in the legal filings or Copyright Office records and do not know who now owns the rights at issue in A.V.E.L.A. If Fleischer owns copyrights in later cartoons, this would only confer rights over character features that were not derived from the iterations it does not own. Suffice it to say that the scope of their copyright claims is unclear, and any copyright actions against others would necessarily be limited to uses that infringe on what they actually own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[15] To quote the Copyright Office primer on derivative works: “[I]t is not possible to extend the length of protection for a copyrighted work by creating a derivative work…the copyright in the derivative work will not extend to the public domain material, and the use of the public domain material in a derivative work will not prevent anyone else from using the same public domain work for another derivative work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[16] See the Copyright Office Compendium. Regarding generic character traits, courts have held that being “nice,” having a “cocky attitude,” and being “young, attractive, and sarcastic” are not independently copyrightable character traits. See Shame on You Prods. v. Banks (C.D. Cal. 2015, aff’d 9th Cir. 2017); Campbell v. Walt Disney Co. (N.D. Cal. 2010); Gable v. Nat’l Broad. Co. (C.D. Cal. 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[17] To look for renewals, we consulted both the Catalog of Copyright Entries and Virtual Card Catalog for renewal records and did not find any.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[18] See Stewart v. Abend (1990).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[19] 15 U.S.C. §§1114, 1125(a). A small subset of superbrands with “famous” marks gets extra protection against “dilution” that impairs the distinctiveness or harms the reputation of the famous mark, even when there is no consumer confusion. This protection is limited to “famous” marks, as defined by trademark law. Fame has a specialized meaning here: only trademarks that are widely recognized by the general public as a brand signifier qualify. It is not enough that a character is famous in the general sense of the word. Instead, its depiction would need to function like the Nike Swoosh in designating product source. Importantly, even for trademarks that qualify, anti-dilution protection is subject to statutory First-Amendment exceptions that allow for the kinds of expressive uses discussed in this section. See 15 U.S.C. §1125(c)(3). For instance, even though “Barbie” is a famous mark that qualifies for anti-dilution protection, the statutory exceptions in §1125(c)(3) have allowed artists to use the “Barbie” trademark for artistic commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[20] Trademark law has a number of speech-protecting limitations that safeguard artistic uses. These apply whether or not the trademark is also the subject of an expired copyright. One defense allows “nominative use” of a trademark as a point of reference – for example, using “Betty Boop” accurately to refer to the character in your work. Another comes from a case called Rogers v. Grimaldi, which privileged the use of trademarks in titles of expressive works when the term has some artistic relevance to the new work and does not explicitly mislead as to the source of the work. A 2023 Supreme Court decision let the Rogers test stand for these kinds of uses, see Jack Daniel's Properties, Inc. v. VIP Products LLC (2023), so long as the unauthorized use is not as a brand signifier. These doctrines are why Mattel loses in court when it sues people for using the word “Barbie” and the doll’s trademarked appearance in expressive works. See Mattel, Inc. v. Walking Mountain Productions (9th Cir. 2003); Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc. (9th Cir. 2002). While a disclaimer is not required to benefit from these limitations, it can nevertheless be useful to make abundantly clear that you are not providing an official Fleischer Studios production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[21] Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox (2003) (“We have been careful to caution against misuse or overextension of trademark and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by . . . copyright”). This case dealt with an attempt to make an attribution-like claim under the federal trademark statute over public domain works, but the larger policy underlying the decision is that trademark law cannot be used to circumvent copyright expiration. Dastar had repackaged parts of a public domain documentary, removing the original credits and presenting it as a Dastar production. Twentieth Century Fox owned the copyrights to the documentary before they expired and claimed that Dastar violated trademark law by passing off Fox’s work as its own and failing to attribute it to Fox. The Supreme Court rejected this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[22] Comedy III v. New Line (9th Cir. 2000). Nonetheless, people sometimes still try to use trademark law to interfere with legal reuses of public domain material, leading to unnecessary litigation and chilling effects. Zorro Productions, Inc. and Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. did this with the Zorro works and the Tarzan and John Carter works. Zorro lost in court—because the Zorro story was in the public domain, a new “Queen of Swords” TV series about Zorro’s sword-wielding daughter could proceed. See Sony v. Fireworks (C.D. Cal. 2001) (the case also included unsuccessful copyright claims). Burroughs was able to extract a joint licensing deal from the publisher of new “Lord of the Jungle” and “Warlord of Mars” comic books; even the threat of lawsuits can chill creative reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[23] The leading treatise on trademark law explains: “The expiration of copyright on a copyrighted work, such as a motion picture containing a cartoon character, should place limits on the scope of trademark rights in the character. Under the view that upon expiration of copyright the public should have free use of the work, copyright policy requires that anyone should be able to reproduce, display and perform the out-of-copyright motion picture so long as there is no confusion as to the source, sponsorship or affiliation of the seller of the reproduced film,” and “a court should not permit trademark in an image to serve the same function as did the lapsed copyright to exclude others from reproducing and distributing the out-of-copyright work, such as a film . . . a balancing of the rights of trademark and of the 'public domain' status of out-of-copyright works is needed. A similar balancing is made when constitutional free speech policies are balanced against the prevention of consumer confusion.” J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition, § 6.30.&lt;/p&gt;

(S.D.N.Y. 1951, aff'd 2d Cir. 1951) (Disney could not prevent another film producer from using the title “Alice in Wonderland” because “the book ‘Alice in Wonderland’ is no longer subject to copyright and is as much in the public domain as are Shakespeare’s plays. Anyone has a legal right to make a picture based on Lewis Carroll’s book and entitled ‘Alice in Wonderland’”).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the Bazel team at Google did not have a very Merry Boxing Day. An SSL certificate expired for https://bcr.bazel.build and https://releases.bazel.build, as shown in this screenshot from the github issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This expired certificate apparently broke the build workflow of users who use Bazel, who were faced with the following error message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
ERROR: Error computing the main repository mapping: Error accessing registry https://bcr.bazel.build/: Failed to fetch registry file https://bcr.bazel.build/modules/platforms/0.0.7/MODULE.bazel: PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: validity check failed
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After mitigation, Xùdōng Yáng provided a brief summary of the incident on the Github ticket:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say the words “expired SSL certificate” to any senior software engineer and watch the expression on their face. Everybody in this industry has been bitten by expired certs, including people who work at orgs that use automated certificate renewal. In fact, this very case is an example of an automated certificate renewal system that failed! From the screenshot above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;it was an auto-renewal being bricked due to some new subdomain additions, and the renewal failures didn’t send notifications for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reality is that SSL certificates are a fundamentally dangerous technology, and the Bazel case is a great example of why. With SSL certificates, you usually don’t have the opportunity to build up operational experience working with them, unless something goes wrong. And things don’t go wrong that often with certificates, especially if you’re using automated cert renewal! That means when something does go wrong, you’re effectively starting from scratch to figure out how to fix it, which is not a good place to be. Once again, from that summary:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And then it took some Bazel team members who were very unfamiliar with this whole area to scramble to read documentation and secure permissions…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t know the specifics of the Bazel team composition: it may very well be that they have local SSL certificate expertise on the team, but those members were out-of-office because of the holiday. But even if that’s the case, with an automated set-it-and-forget-it solution, the knowledge isn’t going to spread across the team, because why would it? It just works on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is, until it stops working. And that’s the other dangerous thing about SSL certificates: the failure mode is the opposite of graceful degradation. It’s not like there’s an increasing percentage of requests that fail as you get closer to the deadline. Instead, in one minute, everything’s working just fine, and in the next minute, every http request fails. There’s no natural signal back to the operators that the SSL certificate is getting close to expiry. To make things worse, there’s no staging of the change that triggers the expiration, because the change is time, and time marches on for everyone. You can’t set the SSL certificate expiration so it kicks in at different times for different cohorts of users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, SSL certs are a technology with an expected failure mode (expiration) that absolutely maximizes blast radius (a hard failure for 100% of users), without any natural feedback to operators that the system is at imminent risk of critical failure. And with automated cert renewal, you are increasing the likelihood that the responders will not have experience with renewing certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it any wonder that these keep biting us?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why Reliability Demands Functional Programming: ADTs, Safety, and Critical Infrastructure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In banking, telecom, and payments, reliability is not a nice to have. It is table stakes. The most reliable systems I have worked on reduce entire classes of bugs before the code even runs. Functional programming and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) let you push correctness into the type system, so illegal states cannot be constructed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you will learn&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How invalid states show up in real systems and why they cause costly incidents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How ADTs encode business rules so the compiler enforces them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How pattern matching and exhaustiveness checks turn refactors into safe edits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Practical modeling patterns for banking and telecom domains in TypeScript and OCaml&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A migration playbook that juniors and mid-levels can apply today&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;References&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Functional programming&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Algebraic data type&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tagged union or sum type&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Product type&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pattern matching&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immutable object&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pure function&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High availability&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1) Reliability starts at the type system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most production incidents are not due to complex algorithms. They are due to the code entering a state that should never have been possible. If you have been on call, you have seen variants of these:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Magic strings: &lt;code&gt;"paypal"&lt;/code&gt;sneaks into a system that only supports&lt;code&gt;Cash&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Card&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Pix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nulls: a function expects an email and receives &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;in a path you forgot to guard&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conflicting booleans: an account is both &lt;code&gt;isActive = true&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;isSuspended = true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Incomplete lifecycles: a transaction is marked &lt;code&gt;Pending&lt;/code&gt;and then jumps to&lt;code&gt;Reversed&lt;/code&gt;without an associated&lt;code&gt;Settled&lt;/code&gt;record&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Functional programming helps by modeling the domain with types that make invalid states unrepresentable. Pure functions and immutability keep behavior predictable and testable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2) ADTs in practice: sums and products&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Product types combine fields, think "and". Sum types choose one of several cases, think "or". Together they model your domain rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Product type example&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
type user = {
  id    : int;
  name  : string;
  email : string option;  (* Some "[email protected]" or None *)
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript
type User = Readonly&amp;lt;{
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email?: string; // we will improve this with Option next
}&amp;gt;;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sum type example&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
type payment =
  | Cash
  | Card of string   (* last 4 digits *)
  | Pix  of string
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript discriminated union
type Payment =
  | { kind: "cash" }
  | { kind: "card"; last4: string }
  | { kind: "pix"; key: string };
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this shape, &lt;code&gt;"paypal"&lt;/code&gt; cannot exist as a &lt;code&gt;Payment&lt;/code&gt;. The compiler refuses the value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3) Pattern matching and exhaustiveness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you pattern match on a sum type, the compiler can force you to handle every variant. If you later add a new case, every non exhaustive match becomes a compilation error or warning. This is how refactors become safe by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
let describe_payment = function
  | Cash -&amp;gt; "Paid in cash"
  | Card last4 -&amp;gt; "Card ••••" ^ last4
  | Pix key -&amp;gt; "Pix " ^ key
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript
const assertNever = (x: never): never =&amp;gt; { throw new Error(`Unhandled variant: ${JSON.stringify(x)}`) }

function describePayment(p: Payment): string {
  switch (p.kind) {
    case "cash":  return "Paid in cash"
    case "card":  return `Card ••••${p.last4}`
    case "pix":   return `Pix ${p.key}`
    default:      return assertNever(p)
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add a new &lt;code&gt;Crypto&lt;/code&gt; method and both code bases will point out every place you must update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4) Failure scenarios and their type driven fixes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.1 Banking example: double settlement and reconciliation drift&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incident story&lt;lb/&gt; A payout worker retries on network timeouts and calls &lt;code&gt;settle()&lt;/code&gt; twice. The table allows &lt;code&gt;pending = false&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;settled = true&lt;/code&gt; twice with the same ledger id. Reconciliation finds duplicates and accounting needs a manual fix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it happened&lt;lb/&gt; State is spread across booleans and strings. The database does not express the lifecycle. The application code does, but only by convention and tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix with ADTs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
type failure_reason =
  | InsufficientFunds
  | ComplianceHold
  | NetworkError of string

type txn_state =
  | Pending
  | Settled  of string       (* ledger_id *)
  | Failed   of failure_reason
  | Reversed of string       (* original_ledger_id *)

type txn = {
  id           : string;
  amount_cents : int;
  state        : txn_state;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript
type FailureReason =
  | { kind: "insufficientFunds" }
  | { kind: "complianceHold" }
  | { kind: "networkError"; message: string }

type TxnState =
  | { kind: "pending" }
  | { kind: "settled"; ledgerId: string }
  | { kind: "failed"; reason: FailureReason }
  | { kind: "reversed"; originalLedgerId: string }

type Txn = Readonly&amp;lt;{
  id: string
  amountCents: number
  state: TxnState
}&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transitions become total functions. You can return a &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; when a transition is not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
type 'a result = Ok of 'a | Error of string

let settle (t: txn) (ledger_id: string) : txn result =
  match t.state with
  | Pending -&amp;gt; Ok { t with state = Settled ledger_id }
  | Settled _ -&amp;gt; Error "already settled"
  | Failed _ -&amp;gt; Error "cannot settle a failed transaction"
  | Reversed _ -&amp;gt; Error "cannot settle a reversed transaction"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript
type Ok&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;  = { _tag: "Ok"; value: T }
type Err&amp;lt;E&amp;gt; = { _tag: "Err"; error: E }
type Result&amp;lt;T, E&amp;gt; = Ok&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; | Err&amp;lt;E&amp;gt;
const Ok = &amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(value: T): Result&amp;lt;T, never&amp;gt; =&amp;gt; ({ _tag: "Ok", value })
const Err = &amp;lt;E&amp;gt;(error: E): Result&amp;lt;never, E&amp;gt; =&amp;gt; ({ _tag: "Err", error })

function settle(t: Txn, ledgerId: string): Result&amp;lt;Txn, string&amp;gt; {
  switch (t.state.kind) {
    case "pending":  return Ok({ ...t, state: { kind: "settled", ledgerId } })
    case "settled":  return Err("already settled")
    case "failed":   return Err("cannot settle a failed transaction")
    case "reversed": return Err("cannot settle a reversed transaction")
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the illegal transitions are blocked by construction. Test coverage still matters, but the shape of the model prevents a class of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refactor safety&lt;lb/&gt; When product adds &lt;code&gt;Chargeback&lt;/code&gt;, the compiler highlights every match that ignores it. You cannot ship with a half handled lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type TxnState =
  | { kind: "pending" }
  | { kind: "settled"; ledgerId: string }
  | { kind: "failed"; reason: FailureReason }
  | { kind: "reversed"; originalLedgerId: string }
  | { kind: "chargeback"; networkRef: string } // new
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;TxnState&lt;/code&gt; now requires a &lt;code&gt;chargeback&lt;/code&gt; branch. This is free guidance from the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.2 Telecom example: ghost billing and incomplete sessions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incident story&lt;lb/&gt; The call detail record pipeline generates billing events whenever it sees a &lt;code&gt;Connected&lt;/code&gt; event. Under jitter and retries, some sessions never receive &lt;code&gt;Completed&lt;/code&gt;. The billing system charges based on the wrong boundary and customers complain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it happened&lt;lb/&gt; The call lifecycle is implicit across many services. A connected session with no end was still billable because there was no type that separated non billable states from billable ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix with ADTs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
type drop_reason = Network | Busy | Timeout

type call =
  | Dialing   of int                   (* at_ms *)
  | Connected of int                   (* started_ms *)
  | Dropped   of drop_reason * int     (* reason, at_ms *)
  | Completed of int * int             (* started_ms, ended_ms *)

let billable_seconds = function
  | Completed (start_ms, end_ms) -&amp;gt; max 0 (end_ms - start_ms) / 1000
  | _ -&amp;gt; 0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript
type DropReason = "network" | "busy" | "timeout"

type Call =
  | { kind: "dialing";   atMs: number }
  | { kind: "connected"; startedMs: number }
  | { kind: "dropped";   reason: DropReason; atMs: number }
  | { kind: "completed"; startedMs: number; endedMs: number }

const billableSeconds = (c: Call): number =&amp;gt; {
  switch (c.kind) {
    case "completed": return Math.max(0, (c.endedMs - c.startedMs) / 1000)
    default:          return 0
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now a connected but never completed call cannot produce a billable duration. The shape forbids the bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.3 Config parsing example: hidden NaN and partial failures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incident story&lt;lb/&gt; A cache TTL is stored in an environment variable. Someone sets &lt;code&gt;CACHE_TTL_SECS=30s&lt;/code&gt;. In JavaScript, &lt;code&gt;Number("30s")&lt;/code&gt; yields &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt; and your code treats it as zero, disabling caching in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix with Result types&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
type 'a result = Ok of 'a | Error of string

let parse_int (s: string) : int result =
  try Ok (int_of_string s) with _ -&amp;gt; Error "invalid int"

let load_ttl () : int option =
  match Sys.getenv_opt "CACHE_TTL_SECS" with
  | None -&amp;gt; None
  | Some s -&amp;gt;
    match parse_int s with
    | Ok n -&amp;gt; Some n
    | Error _ -&amp;gt; None  (* or propagate the error *)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript
const parseIntR = (s: string): Result&amp;lt;number, "invalid-int"&amp;gt; =&amp;gt;
  /^-?\d+$/.test(s) ? Ok(Number(s)) : Err("invalid-int")

function loadTtl(): Option&amp;lt;number&amp;gt; {
  const raw = process.env.CACHE_TTL_SECS
  if (!raw) return None
  const parsed = parseIntR(raw)
  return parsed._tag === "Ok" ? Some(parsed.value) : None
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ambiguity disappears. The code must handle absence and parse errors explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5) Options and Results as first class tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not use &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; to mean "maybe". Do not throw exceptions for expected errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Option or Maybe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
type user = { id: int; email: string option }

let send_mail (u: user) =
  match u.email with
  | Some e -&amp;gt; (* send e *) ()
  | None   -&amp;gt; ()
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript
type None = { _tag: "None" }
type Some&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; = { _tag: "Some"; value: T }
type Option&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; = None | Some&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
const None: None = { _tag: "None" }
const Some = &amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(value: T): Option&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; =&amp;gt; ({ _tag: "Some", value })

const map = &amp;lt;A, B&amp;gt;(o: Option&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;, f: (a: A) =&amp;gt; B): Option&amp;lt;B&amp;gt; =&amp;gt;
  o._tag === "Some" ? Some(f(o.value)) : None
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Result or Either&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
let result_map f = function
  | Ok x -&amp;gt; Ok (f x)
  | Error e -&amp;gt; Error e
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript
type Ok&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;  = { _tag: "Ok"; value: T }
type Err&amp;lt;E&amp;gt; = { _tag: "Err"; error: E }
type Result&amp;lt;T, E&amp;gt; = Ok&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; | Err&amp;lt;E&amp;gt;
const Ok  = &amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(value: T): Result&amp;lt;T, never&amp;gt; =&amp;gt; ({ _tag: "Ok", value })
const Err = &amp;lt;E&amp;gt;(error: E): Result&amp;lt;never, E&amp;gt; =&amp;gt; ({ _tag: "Err", error })
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These types make the happy path and the error path equally explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;6) Immutability and why it simplifies reasoning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mutable shared state is a common source of heisenbugs under concurrency. Prefer immutable data and pure functions. When you need to update, create a new value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
let set_email (u: user) (e: string option) : user =
  { u with email = e }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript
type User = Readonly&amp;lt;{ id: number; name: string; email: Option&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; }&amp;gt;

const setEmail = (u: User, email: Option&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;): User =&amp;gt;
  ({ ...u, email })
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your tests become simple. Given the same inputs, the function returns the same output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;7) Smart constructors and newtypes to protect units and invariants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Numbers are not self describing. Create types that carry meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml *)
module Cents : sig
  type t
  val make : int -&amp;gt; t            (* reject negatives *)
  val add  : t -&amp;gt; t -&amp;gt; t
end = struct
  type t = Cents of int
  let make x = if x &amp;lt; 0 then invalid_arg "negative cents" else Cents x
  let add (Cents a) (Cents b) = Cents (a + b)
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript
type Brand&amp;lt;K, T&amp;gt; = K &amp;amp; { __brand: T }

type Cents = Brand&amp;lt;number, "Cents"&amp;gt;
const Cents = (n: number): Cents =&amp;gt; {
  if (!Number.isInteger(n) || n &amp;lt; 0) throw new Error("invalid cents")
  return n as Cents
}

type Millis = Brand&amp;lt;number, "Millis"&amp;gt;
const Millis = (n: number): Millis =&amp;gt; n as Millis

const price: Cents = Cents(500)
// const wrong: Cents = Millis(500)  // type error
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You stop mixing milliseconds with seconds or dollars with cents by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;8) Pure core, effectful shell&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep the domain logic pure and push IO to the edges. This makes unit tests cheap and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* OCaml, pure core *)
let authorize_payment (amount: Cents.t) (balance: Cents.t) : bool =
  amount &amp;lt;= balance  (* assume a comparison helper inside the module *)

(* impure shell *)
let run () =
  let amount = Cents.make 500 in
  let balance = Cents.make 1200 in
  if authorize_payment amount balance then
    (* call database and payment gateway here *) ()
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// TypeScript, pure core
const authorizePayment = (amount: Cents, balance: Cents): boolean =&amp;gt; {
  return (amount as unknown as number) &amp;lt;= (balance as unknown as number)
}

// effectful shell
async function run() {
  const amount = Cents(500)
  const balance = Cents(1200)
  if (authorizePayment(amount, balance)) {
    // perform DB writes or API calls here
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;9) Migration playbook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start small and make continuous progress. Here is a practical order for a team new to these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Replace pairs of booleans with a sum type&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Before: &lt;code&gt;{ isActive: boolean; isSuspended: boolean }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;After: &lt;code&gt;type AccountState = { kind: "active" } | { kind: "suspended" } | { kind: "closed" }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Before: &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Replace string enums with discriminated unions&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Avoid free form strings like &lt;code&gt;"pending" | "settled" | "failed" | string&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avoid free form strings like &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Replace nullable fields with Option&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;OCaml &lt;code&gt;string option&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;TypeScript &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;or a stricter domain specific union&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OCaml &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Replace thrown control flow with Result&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Reserve exceptions for truly unexpected situations&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Introduce newtypes or branded types for units and ids&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Prevent mixing &lt;code&gt;Millis&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;Seconds&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Cents&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;Dollars&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prevent mixing &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enforce exhaustiveness&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;OCaml already warns&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;TypeScript: discriminated unions, &lt;code&gt;assertNever&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;strictNullChecks&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;noImplicitReturns&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add guard rails in CI&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Treat TypeScript non exhaustive switches and OCaml warnings as errors&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smells to look for&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple booleans that can be true at the same time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Strings that travel far before being validated&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Functions that sometimes return a value and sometimes throw&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Types that carry numbers without units&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;10) Performance and ergonomics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pattern matching compiles to simple branches. Discriminated unions in TypeScript are just plain objects. The main cost you will feel is validation at the boundaries in smart constructors. This is a trade worth making. The compiler then protects the interior of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reliability is designed. With Algebraic Data Types, pattern matching, Option and Result, immutability, and smart constructors, you encode domain rules directly in your types. Illegal states cannot compile. This is why industries that cannot afford failure, such as banking and telecom, gravitate to functional ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you work on code that touches money, minutes, or public availability, adopt these patterns now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Model workflows with sum types, not conflicting flags&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use Option and Result instead of nullable and throwable APIs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep a pure core with effects at the edges&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Brand units and identifiers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enforce exhaustiveness during code review and in CI&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your on call shifts will be quieter, and your users will notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Further reading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Functional programming&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Algebraic data type&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tagged union or sum type&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Product type&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pattern matching&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immutable object&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pure function&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High availability&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How Dad’s Fitness May Be Packaged and Passed Down in Sperm RNA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard sperm-meets-egg story posits that sperm cells are hardly more than bundles of shrink-wrapped DNA with tails. Their mission is simple: Deliver a father’s genes into a mother’s egg for sexual reproduction. Just about all other aspects of a developing embryo, including its cellular and environmental components, have nothing to do with dad. Those all come from mom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But nearly two decades of studies from multiple independent labs threaten to rewrite that story. They suggest that dad’s gametes shuttle more than DNA: Within a sperm’s minuscule head are stowaway molecules, which enter the egg and convey information about the father’s fitness, such as diet, exercise habits and stress levels, to his offspring. These non-DNA transfers may influence genomic activity that boots up during and after fertilization, exerting some control over the embryo’s development and influencing the adult they will become.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings, so far largely described in mouse models, could end up changing the way we think about heredity. They suggest “that what we do in this life affects the next generation,” said Qi Chen, a reproductive and developmental biologist at the University of Utah Medical School who is among the pioneers of this research. In other words: What a father eats, drinks, inhales, is stressed by or otherwise experiences in the weeks and months before he conceives a child might be encoded in molecules, packaged into his sperm cells and transmitted to his future kid. The researchers have largely zeroed in on RNA molecules, those short-lived copies of DNA that reflect genetic activity at a given time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a tantalizing notion. But the mechanistic details — how experience is encoded, how it’s transferred from sperm to egg, and whether and how it affects a developing embryo — are not easy to unpack, especially given the challenges of conducting research in human subjects. For this reason, and because of the potentially textbook-rewriting implications of the findings, researchers, including those spearheading the work, are cautious about overselling their results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s still very hand-wavy,” said the epigeneticist Colin Conine of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who has been trying to uncover the mechanics of how sperm RNA can contribute nongenetic information to progeny. Some elements of the story are clear, he said: Researchers have significant evidence that the environment can regulate sperm RNAs, that these molecules transmit traits to offspring and that they can regulate embryonic development after fertilization. “We just don’t have really any understanding of how RNAs can do this, and that’s the hand-wavy part,” Conine said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But evidence keeps piling up. Most recently, in November 2025, a comprehensive paper published in Cell Metabolism traced the downstream molecular effects of a father mouse’s exercise regimen on sperm microRNAs that target genes “critical for mitochondrial function and metabolic control” in a developing embryo. The researchers found many of those same RNAs overexpressed in the sperm of well-exercised human men.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This study shows that paternal exercise can confer benefits — enhanced endurance and metabolic health — to offspring,” said Chen, who was not involved in the study. “It’s a powerful reminder that many sperm-mediated epigenetic effects are deeply adaptive in nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The possibility that a previously undocumented avenue of inheritance is at play is too important to ignore. That’s why the researchers are now hunkering down in their labs to trace out the molecular processes that would have to operate for a father’s here-and-now experience to be transferred as developmental instructions to his partner’s egg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Epigenetic Avenues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most animals, a sperm cell is tiny compared to an egg cell. In humans, an egg contains 10 million times the volume of a sperm and contributes most cellular components — nutrition, cytoplasm, mitochondria and other organelles, the molecular machinery to make proteins, and more — to a zygote (a newly fertilized egg that hasn’t started dividing). Plus, a mother provides the environment within which an embryo and then fetus develops and grows. As a result, the effect of a mother’s health on her children has long been scrutinized, including at the molecular level. But over the past 15 years or so, the evidence for some kind of non-DNA inheritance of paternal experience has also been strengthening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are many different labs that have done diet and stress studies, and typically the readouts of those in the next generation are either metabolism or behavioral changes,” Conine said. Feed a male mouse a high-fat or low-protein diet, or take him away from his mom when he is young, and his offspring will inherit traits, such as changes in mitochondrial function, related to those environmental conditions. These traits aren’t necessarily detrimental. For instance, mouse fathers exposed to nicotine sire male pups with livers that are good at disarming not just nicotine but cocaine and other toxins as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a survival logic here, said Oliver Rando, an epigeneticist at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School who led the nicotine study. It’s reasonable to expect that offspring will experience an environmental context similar to that of their parents. Biologically priming them for those conditions could therefore help them survive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You might think of this as a way to tell your kids something useful for them so that they can be better at dealing with the world they inherit,” said Rando, a father of two boys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But logic does not make the story true. That’s why Chen, Rando, Conine and other researchers have been working to uncover the mechanistic components of dad-based epigenetic heredity to add to what is already known about these processes in mothers. “Epigenetics” refers to heredity processes that do not change the DNA sequences of genes, but rather involve when and to what degree genes are expressed and made into functional proteins. Epigeneticists focus on the molecular biology that unfolds around genomic and chromosomal frameworks that can switch genes on and off in response to internal and external cues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of differential gene expression is central to some of biology’s greatest wonders — for example, the fact that all cells in the human body have the same DNA, and yet brain cells differ dramatically from liver, skin and blood cells. Some cues that trigger changes in gene expression are programmed into DNA, while others come from the environment — for example, a dearth of calories or nutrients due to food deprivation, or rising cortisol levels due to stressors such as the absence of parental care. These conditions affect the kinds of metabolites and other molecules circulating in our bodies, which influences what kinds of reactions and genomic processes cells can carry out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some molecules involved in epigenetic processes, such as methyl or acetyl groups, interface directly with DNA or bind to proteins attached to DNA. These actions loosen up or batten down portions of the genome and are akin to opening or closing doors to specific genes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RNA molecules — flexible, ephemeral versions of DNA sequences — can also intervene in gene expression. But because they are relatively short-lived, sometimes surviving mere minutes or hours before degrading, they have been overlooked as epigenetic regulators. Since the 1990s, their roles have been clarified, as has their longevity: Certain RNAs can survive for weeks or longer. Some RNAs (such as long noncoding RNAs, or lncRNAs) regulate gene expression by modifying DNA or its proteins. Others, known as microRNAs, alter or repress other RNAs, including those that would otherwise be translated into proteins; this discovery was awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could sperm carry RNA or other molecules that then participate in epigenetic processes in the embryo? It seemed plausible to some researchers, but it would take a whole lot of experimental work to put the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Package of RNA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three core questions that biologists need to resolve to confirm that sperm cells transmit epigenetic inheritance. The first is how a father’s body physically encodes lived experience, such as stress, diet, exercise or nicotine use, in the form of molecules — for example, as RNAs circulating in blood that reflect gene expression in tissues. The next centers on how molecularly encoded experience could make its way into sperm cells. The third traces how those signals in sperm could become epigenetic vectors during and after fertilization to specify observable traits, known as phenotypes, in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a series of studies beginning in 2012, Qi Chen started answering all three questions. In what he describes as one of the most serendipitous discoveries of his career, his team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing used sequencing techniques to inventory the short RNA molecules present in mice sperm cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They were shocked to see a subset of the RNAs drastically increasing in concentration as sperm cells matured, and then crowding into the sperm heads with DNA. This same class of RNAs was abundant in the blood serum of various vertebrates, ranging from fish to humans, they found. All of this pointed to the possibility that information-carrying molecules were being transferred into the reproductive cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It got even more interesting when Chen, who moved to the U.S. academic circuit in 2015, and his team collected sperm RNAs from male mice fed different diets. The RNA assemblages in mice reared on high-fat foods differed dramatically from those in mice that were fed normal diets. And when the researchers injected the RNAs from the sperm of the fat-eating mice into a zygote, some of the male offspring showed metabolic issues associated with a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The experiments hinted at a seemingly heretical possibility, Chen said: that “certain acquired traits during paternal exposure can be ‘memorized’ in the sperm and inherited by the offspring.” After characterizing a pathway that regulates sperm RNAs, in 2019 Chen dubbed this channel of heredity the “sperm RNA code,” which he suggested “programs the metabolic health of offspring.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He wasn’t the only one to become fixated on this idea. Around the same time, in an article published in Developmental Cell in 2018, Rando’s team reported the use of biochemical techniques to characterize where and when RNAs are packaged into sperm cells and how those RNAs might change during this process. They were trying to answer the question: “What tissue could be responsible for choosing what to tell sperm to tell kids?” he said. One logical place to start looking was the epididymis. Within this tubular organ attached to the back of the testicle, sperm cells undergo a maturation process, taking about one to two weeks in most mammalian species, before they become ready for fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rando’s data showed that sperm cells gain almost all their small RNAs when they are in the epididymis. Using techniques for tracking specific RNA molecules, the scientists observed RNAs getting packaged into virus-size capsules, called epididymosomes, which shuttled the molecules into sperm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This shows how small RNAs can get trafficked between the body’s nonreproductive cells, like those in the epididymis, and germline cells,” such as sperm, Rando said. “The epididymis has been emerging as a key location for paternal effects. Certainly the epididymis has to be taken seriously as a potential sensor of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Molecular Snapshot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By “sensor of the world,” Rando is referring to the first stage of a presumed paternal-effects mechanism — when a male’s body translates a lived condition, such as a high-fat diet, rigorous exercise or toxin exposure, into molecular signals. The epididymis then provides a route for the second step, packaging those signals for the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also where investigations by Isabelle Mansuy come in. At the University of Zurich and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, she studies the molecular and cellular mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;© Philippe Rossier / Ringier Media Switzerland&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one line of her research, she focuses on processes that transmit the molecular effects of traumatic stress to subsequent generations by focusing on extracellular vesicles (EVs) that circulate in blood. Shed by almost every type of cell in the body, including in the epididymis (the epididymosomes are EVs), they carry a diversity of molecular cargo, such as RNAs, proteins, lipids and metabolites. Because EVs circulate in blood just about anywhere in the body and can cross cell membranes, they provide a potential means to transfer molecules and the biological cues they carry between bodily tissues and reproductive cells. Notably, RNAs tend to survive longer when packaged in EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mansuy creates trauma in mice by subjecting the animals to conditions such as restraint or maternal separation when they are young. Then she searches for molecular changes in reproductive cells that could cause similar consequences of trauma to manifest in the children or even grandchildren of the animals who directly endure it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She’s shown that traumatic stress alters metabolic pathways, especially those that involve lipids, in exposed male mice and their offspring. She has also found a similar metabolic profile in humans who experienced high stress in childhood. In mice, some of the metabolic changes remained discernible through five generations — a rare data-backed finding for epigenetic inheritance cascading through generations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dennis Kunkel Microscopy/Science Source&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March 2025, in a preprint uploaded to biorxiv.org, Mansuy and colleagues reported that EVs in mice can transport certain RNAs, metabolites and lipids linked to early-life stress from circulating blood to sperm, with consequences for offspring. The offspring produced by these sperm cells had stress-related metabolic dysfunction as adults and bore the stress signatures in their own sperm RNA. “These changes imply a mechanistic link between sperm RNA modifications and phenotypic features in the offspring,” Mansuy’s team concluded in their paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Phenotypic Translation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the trickiest step to understand is how sperm-borne molecules could influence an adult’s observable traits. In one form of experiment, researchers extract all the sperm RNA from mice that have been raised under stressful or health-altering conditions. Those isolated RNAs are then injected into a zygote. Pups that emerge usually “get the dad’s phenotypes,” Conine said, suggesting that the RNAs alone confer traits from dad to offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But how? During early development, epigenetic processes reign. As one fertilized cell divides into two, and those cells divide again, and so on, one set of DNA instructions is dynamically and repeatedly reprogrammed. The growing body specializes into different cell types and is sculpted into a sequence of increasingly complex forms. It’s possible, then, that early epigenetic alterations to the genome could have significant downstream effects on an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research out of Conine’s lab, published in 2024, showed that sperm microRNAs alter gene expression in mouse embryos. Experiments like these, he said, support the idea that offspring can inherit paternal traits via the transfer of non-DNA molecular stowaways in sperm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recent Cell Metabolism paper took this idea a step further by tracing a mechanism by which this can happen. A team of more than two dozen Chinese researchers focused on the epigenetic transmission of exercise benefits, homing in on a set of microRNAs that reprogram gene expression in the early embryo. These changes ultimately result in skeletal muscle adaptations in adult offspring that enhance exercise endurance. The researchers found that well-exercised mice had more of these microRNAs in their sperm than sedentary mice did. When these microRNAs were transferred into zygotes, the adults they grew into were more physically fit, with more mitochondria in skeletal muscle and higher endurance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But how did the molecules generate the exercise-positive phenotype? In experiments, the researchers found that the microRNAs suppressed a particular protein, which had the effect of boosting genes related to mitochondrial activity and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the sperm of physically trained male humans also hosted higher levels of many of the same microRNAs than those of untrained cohorts. “This cross-species conservation suggests a potential role for these sperm mi[cro]RNAs in intergenerational exercise adaptations in humans,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The First Draft&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The notion that a father’s lived experience can become recorded by his body, transmitted to his gametes and relayed to his offspring is no longer as outlandish as it once seemed. Many researchers in the field are willing to float speculative visions of what could be going on, even as they acknowledge that gaps remain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our hypothesis is that the epididymis ‘sees’ the world and alters the small RNAs it produces in response,” Rando said. “These RNAs are then delivered to the zygote upon fertilization and control early gene regulation and development to shape offspring health and disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conine speculates that once certain RNAs make their way into the egg, they trigger “a cascade of changes in developmental gene expression that then leads to these phenotypes” of the father showing up in the next generation. Remarkably, this unfolds even though the sheer volume of the sperm’s contents is so much less than an egg’s contents, including the relative amounts of RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full picture of how paternal experience and behavior might epigenetically influence offspring is not nearly in hand. Researchers are currently piecing the story together, one experiment at a time, rather than proving out every step sequentially in the same set of organisms. One of the gaps is in the characterization of what RNA and perhaps other epigenetic factors do in the zygote to modify genomic activity as it unfolds during development, Mansuy said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are still blind men describing for the first time different parts of the same elephant,” Chen said. “The underlying mechanism is almost certainly an orchestra of a sperm RNA code and factors beyond that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirming the findings in humans would take enormous effort, but it would be key to turning these findings in mice into “informed medical advice,” Chen said. This would require well-controlled experiments following multiple generations, tracking diet, exercise, aging and environmental exposures, while also using advanced tools to decode sperm-packaged molecules — and then looking for strong correlations between the molecular and phenotypic data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even amid the uncertainties, researchers are cautiously moving forward as they learn to believe the results of their own experiments. If they’re right, they will have discovered a new fact of life, Rando said. When he thinks about his two boys, he wonders what he might have done differently when he was younger, before they were born, that might have tweaked his RNA profile in ways that would affect them today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We don’t know enough yet to develop guidance like that,” Rando said. “Maybe we will get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
