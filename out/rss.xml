  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce a significant advancement in the security of the Signal Protocol: the introduction of the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet (SPQR). This new ratchet enhances the Signal Protocol’s resilience against future quantum computing threats while maintaining our existing security guarantees of forward secrecy and post-compromise security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Signal Protocol is a set of cryptographic specifications that provides end-to-end encryption for private communications exchanged daily by billions of people around the world. After its publication in 2013, the open source Signal Protocol was adopted not only by the Signal application but also by other major messaging products. Technical information on the Signal Protocol can be found in the specifications section of our docs site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a previous blog post, we announced the first step towards advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an upgrade called PQXDH that incorporates quantum-resistent cryptographic secrets when chat sessions are established in order to protect against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks that could allow current chat sessions to become compromised if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is developed in the future. However, the Signal Protocol isn’t just about protecting cryptographic material and keys at the beginning of a new chat or phone call; it’s also designed to minimize damage and heal from compromise as that conversation continues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We refer to these security goals as Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS). FS and PCS can be considered mirrors of each other: FS protects past messages against future compromise, while PCS protects future messages from past compromise. Today, we are happy to announce the next step in advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an additional regularly advancing post-quantum ratchet called the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR. On its own, SPQR provides secure messaging that provably achieves these FS and PCS guarantees in a quantum safe manner. We mix the output of this new ratcheting protocol with Signal’s existing Double Ratchet, in a combination we refer to as the Triple Ratchet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you as a Signal user? First, when it comes to your experience using the app, nothing changes. Second, because of how we’re rolling this out and mixing it in with our existing encryption, eventually all of your conversations will move to this new protocol without you needing to take any action. Third, and most importantly, this protects your communications both now and in the event that cryptographically relevant quantum computers eventually become a reality, and it allows us to maintain our existing security guarantees of forward secrecy and post-compromise security as we proactively prepare for that new world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Current State of the Signal Protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Signal ratchet uses hash functions for FS and a set of elliptic-curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) secret exchanges for PCS. The hash functions are quantum safe, but elliptic-curve cryptography is not. An example is in order: our favorite users, Alice and Bob, establish a long-term connection and chat over it regularly. During that session’s lifetime, Alice and Bob regularly agree on new ECDH secrets and use them to “ratchet” their session. Mean ol’ Mallory records the entire (encrypted) communication, and really wants to know what Alice and Bob are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concept of a “ratchet” is crucial to our current non-quantum FS/PCS protection. In the physical world, a ratchet is a mechanism that allows a gear to rotate forward, but disallows rotation backwards. In the Signal Protocol, it takes on a similar role. When Alice and Bob “ratchet” their session, they replace the set of keys they were using prior with a new set based on both the older secrets and a new one they agree upon. Given access to those new secrets, though, there’s no (non-quantum) way to compute the older secrets. By being “one-way”, this ratcheting mechanism provides FS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ECDH mechanism allows Alice and Bob to generate new, small (32 bytes) data blobs and attach them to every message. Whenever each party receives a message from the other, they can locally (and relatively cheaply) use this data blob to agree on a new shared secret, then use that secret to ratchet their side of the protocol. Crucially, ECDH also allows Alice and Bob to both agree on the new secret without sending that secret itself over their session, and in fact without sending anything over the session that Mallory could use to determine it. This description of Diffie-Hellman key exchange provides more details on the concepts of such a key exchange, and this description of ECDH provides specific details on the variant used by the current Signal protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometime midway through the lifetime of Alice and Bob’s session, Mallory successfully breaches the defences of both Alice and Bob, gaining access to all of the (current) secrets used for their session at the time of request. Alice and Bob should have the benefits of Forward Secrecy - they’ve ratcheted sometime recently before the compromise, so no messages earlier than their last ratchet are accessible to Mallory, since ratcheting isn’t reversible. They also retain the benefits of Post-Compromise Security. Their ratcheting after Mallory’s secret access agrees upon new keys that can’t be gleaned just from the captured data they pass between each other, re-securing the session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should Mallory have access to a quantum computer, though, things aren’t so simple. Because elliptic curve cryptography is not quantum resistant, it’s possible that Mallory could glean access to the secret that Alice and Bob agreed upon, just by looking at the communication between them. Given this, Alice and Bob’s session will never “heal”; Mallory’s access to their network traffic from this point forward will allow her to decrypt all future communications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mixing In Quantum Security&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to make our security guarantees stand up to quantum attacks, we need to mix in secrets generated from quantum secure algorithms. In PQXDH, we did this by performing an additional round of key agreement during the session-initiating handshake, then mixing the resulting shared secret into the initial secret material used to create Signal sessions. To handle FS and PCS, we need to do continuous key agreement, where over the lifetime of a session we keep generating new shared secrets and mixing those keys into our encryption keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luckily there is a tool designed exactly for this purpose: the quantum-secure Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM). KEMs share similar behavior to the Diffie-Hellman mechanisms we described earlier, where two clients provide each other with information, eventually deciding on a shared secret, without anyone who intercepts their communications being able to access that secret. However, there is one important distinction for KEMs - they require ordered, asymmetric messages to be passed between their clients. In ECDH, both clients send the other some public parameters, and both combine these parameters with their locally held secrets and come up with an identical shared secret. In the standardized ML-KEM key-encapsulation mechanism, though, the initiating client generates a pair of encapsulation key (EK) and decapsulation key (DK) (analogous to a public and private key respectively) and sends the EK. The receiving client receives it, generates a secret, and wraps it into a ciphertext (CT) with that key. The initiating client receives that CT and decapsulates with its previously generated DK. In the end, both clients have access to the new, shared secret, just through slightly different means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wanting to integrate this quantum-secure key sharing into Signal, we could take a simple, naive approach for each session. When Alice initiates a session with Bob,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice, with every message she sends, sends an EK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bob, with every message he receives, generates a secret and a CT, and sends the CT back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice, on receiving a CT, extracts the secret with her DK and mixes it in&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This initially simple-looking approach, though, quickly runs into a number of issues we’ll need to address to make our protocol actually robust. First, encapsulation keys and CTs are large - over 1000 bytes each for ML-KEM 768, compared to the 32 bytes required for ECDH. Second, while this protocol works well when both clients are online, what happens when a client is offline? Or a message is dropped or reordered? Or Alice wants to send 10 messages before Bob wants to send one?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of these problems have well-understood solutions, but others have trade-offs that may shine in certain circumstances but fall short in others. Let’s dive in and come to some conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who Wants What When&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does Alice decide what to send based on what Bob needs next, and vice versa? If Bob hasn’t received an EK yet, she shouldn’t send the next one. What does Bob send when he hasn’t yet received an EK from Alice, or when he has, but he’s already responded to it? This is a common problem when remote parties send messages to communicate, so there’s a good, well-understood solution: a state machine. Alice and Bob both keep track of “what state am I in”, and base their decisions on that. When sending or receiving a message, they might also change their state. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice wants to send a message, but she’s in a StartingA state, so she doesn’t have an EK. So, she generates an EK/DK pair, stores them locally, and transitions to the SendEK state&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice wants to send a message and is in the SendEK state. She sends the EK along with the message&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice wants to send another message, but she’s still in the SendEK state. So, she sends the EK with the new message as well&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bob receives the message with the EK. He generates a secret and uses the EK to create a CT. He transitions to the SendingCT state.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bob wants to send a message and he’s in the SendingCT state. He sends the CT along with the message&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bob wants to send a message and he’s in the SendingCT state. He sends the CT along with the message&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;… etc …&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By crafting a set of states and transitions, both sides can coordinate what’s sent. Note, though, that even in this simple case, we see problems. For example, we’re sending our (large) EK and (large) CT multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Say (or Send) Less&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve already mentioned that the size of the data we’re sending has increased pretty drastically, from 32 bytes to over 1000 per message. But bandwidth is expensive, especially on consumer devices like client phones, that may be anywhere in the world and have extremely varied costs for sending bytes over the wire. So let’s discuss strategies for conserving that bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the simplest approach - don’t send a new key with every message. Just, for example, send with every 50 messages, or once a week, or every 50 messages unless you haven’t sent a key in a week, or any other combination of options. All of these approaches tend to work pretty well in online cases, where both sides of a session are communicating in real-time with no message loss. But in cases where one side is offline or loss can occur, they can be problematic. Consider the case of “send a key if you haven’t sent one in a week”. If Bob has been offline for 2 weeks, what does Alice do when she wants to send a message? What happens if we can lose messages, and we lose the one in fifty that contains a new key? Or, what happens if there’s an attacker in the middle that wants to stop us from generating new secrets, and can look for messages that are 1000 bytes larger than the others and drop them, only allowing keyless messages through?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another method is to chunk up a message. Want to send 1000 bytes? Send 10 chunks of 100 bytes each. Already sent 10 chunks? Resend the first chunk, then the second, etc. This smooths out the total number of bytes sent, keeping individual message sizes small and uniform. And often, loss of messages is handled. If chunk 1 was lost, just wait for it to be resent. But it runs into an issue with message loss - if chunk 99 was lost, the receiver has to wait for all of chunks 1-98 to be resent before it receives the chunk it missed. More importantly, if a malicious middleman wants to stop keys from being decided upon, they could always drop chunk 3, never allowing the full key to pass between the two parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can get around all of these issues using a concept called erasure codes. Erasure codes work by breaking up a larger message into smaller chunks, then sending those along. Let’s consider our 1000 byte message being sent as 100 byte chunks again. After chunk #10 has been sent, the entirety of the original 1000 byte message has been sent along in cleartext. But rather than just send the first chunk over again, erasure codes build up a new chunk #11, and #12, etc. And they build them in such a way that, once the recipient receives any 10 chunks in any order, they’ll be able to reconstruct the original 1000 byte message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we put this concept of erasure code chunks together with our previous state machine, it gives us a way to send large blocks of data in small chunks, while handling messages that are dropped. Crucially, this includes messages dropped by a malicious middleman: since any N chunks can be used to recreate the original message, a bad actor would need to drop all messages after #N-1 to disallow the data to go through, forcing them into a complete (and highly noticeable) denial of service. Now, if Alice wants to send an EK to Bob, Alice will:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transition from the StartingA state to the SendingEK state, by generating a new EK and chunking it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;While in the SendingEK state, send a new chunk of the EK along with any messages she sends&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When she receives confirmation that the recipient has received the EK (when she receives a chunk of CT), transition to the ReceivingCT state&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Bob’s side, he will:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transition from the StartingB state to the ReceivingEK state when he receives its first EK chunk&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep receiving EK chunks until he has enough to reconstruct the EK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At that point, reconstruct the EK, generate the CT, chunk the CT, and transition to the SendingCT state&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;From this point on, he will send a chunk of the CT with every message&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One interesting way of looking at this protocol so far is to consider the messages flowing from Alice to Bob as potential capacity for sending data associated with post-quantum ratcheting: each message that we send, we could also send additional data like a chunk of EK or of the CT. If we look at Bob’s side, above, we notice that sometimes he’s using that capacity (IE: in step 4 when he’s sending CT chunks) and sometimes he’s not (if he sends a message to Alice during step 2, he has no additional data to send). This capacity is pretty limited, so using more of it gives us the potential to speed up our protocol and agree on new secrets more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Meditation On How Faster Isn’t Always Better&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to generate shared secrets, then use them to secure messages. So, does that mean that we want to generate shared secrets as fast as possible? Let’s introduce a new term: an epoch. Alice and Bob start their sessions in epoch 0, sending the EKs for epoch 1 (EK#1) and associated ciphertext (CT#1) to each other. Once that process completes, they have a new shared secret they use to enter epoch 1, after which all newly sent messages are protected by the new secret. Each time they generate a new shared secret, they use it to enter a new epoch. Surely, every time we enter a new epoch with a new shared secret, we protect messages before that secret (FS) and after that secret (PCS), so faster generation is better? It seems simple, but there’s an interesting complexity here that deserves attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s discuss how to do things faster. Right now, there’s a lot of capacity we’re not using: Bob sends nothing while Alice sends an EK, and Alice sends nothing while Bob sends a CT. Speeding this up isn’t actually that hard. Let’s change things so that Alice sends EK#1, and once Bob acknowledges its receipt, Alice immediately generates and sends EK#2. And once she notices Bob has received that, she generates and sends EK#3, etc. Whenever Alice sends a new message, she always has data to send along with it (new EK chunks), so she’s using its full capacity. Bob doesn’t always have a new CT to send, but he is receiving EKs as fast as Alice can send them, so he often has a new CT to send along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now let’s consider what happens when an attacker gains access to Alice. Let’s say that Alice has sent EK#1 and EK#2 to Bob, and she’s in the process of sending EK#3. Bob has acknowledged receipt of EK#1 and EK#2, but he’s still in the process of sending CT#1, since in this case Bob sends fewer messages to Alice than vice versa. Because Alice has already generated 3 EKs she hasn’t used, Alice needs to keep the associated DK#1, DK#2, and DK#3 around. So, if at this point someone maliciously gains control of Alice’s device, they gain access to both the secrets associated with the current epoch (here, epoch 0) and to the DKs necessary to reconstruct the secrets to other epochs (here, epochs 1, 2, and 3) using only the over-the-wire CT that Bob has yet to send. This is a big problem: by generating secrets early, we’ve actually made the in-progress epochs and any messages that will be sent within them less secure against this single-point-in-time breach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test this out, we at Signal built a number of different state machines, each sending different sets of data either in parallel or serially. We then ran these state machines in numerous simulations, varying things like the ratio of messages sent by Alice vs Bob, the amount of data loss or reordering, etc. And while running these simulations, we tracked what epochs’ secrets were exposed at any point in time, assuming an attacker were to breach either Alice’s or Bob’s secret store. The results showed that, in general, while simulations that handled multiple epochs’ secrets in parallel (IE: by sending EK#2 before receipt of CT#1) did generate new epochs more quickly, they actually made more messages vulnerable to a single breach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;But Let’s Still Be Efficient&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This still leaves us with a problem, though: the capacity present in messages we send in either direction is still a precious resource, and we want to use it as efficiently as possible. And our simple approach of Alice’s “send EK, receive CT, repeat” and Bob’s “receive EK, send CT, repeat” leaves lots of time where Alice and Bob have nothing to send, should that capacity be available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To improve our use of our sending capacity, we decided to take a harder look into the ML-KEM algorithm we’re using to share secrets, to see if there was room to improve. Let’s break things down more and share some actual specifics on the ML-KEM algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice generates an EK of 1184 bytes to send to Bob, and an associated DK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bob receives the EK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bob samples a new shared secret (32 bytes), which he encrypts with EK into a CT of 1088 bytes to send to Alice&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice receives the CT, uses the DK to decrypt it, and now also has access to the 32 byte shared secret&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diving in further, we can break out step #3 into some sub-steps&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice generates an EK of 1184 bytes to send to Bob, and an associated DK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bob receives the EK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bob samples a new shared secret (32 bytes), which he encrypts with EK into a CT of 1088 bytes to send to Alice1&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bob creates a new shared secret S and sampled randomness R by sampling entropy and combining it with a hash of EK&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bob hashes the EK into a Hash&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bob pulls 32 bytes of the EK, a Seed&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bob uses the Seed and R to generate the majority of the CT&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bob then uses S and EK to generate the last portion of the CT&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice receives the CT, uses the DK to decrypt it, and now also has access to the 32 byte shared secret&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 3.d, which generates 960 bytes of the 1088-byte CT, only needs 64 bytes of input: a Seed that’s 32 of EK’s bytes, and the hash of EK, which is an additional 32. If we combine these values and send them first, then most of EK and most of the CT can be sent in parallel from Alice to Bob and Bob to Alice respectively. Our more complicated but more efficient secret sharing now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice generates EK and DK. Alice extracts the 32-byte Seed from EK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alice sends 64 bytes EK1 (Seed + Hash(EK)) to Bob. Bob sends nothing during this time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bob receives the Seed and Hash, and generates the first, largest part of the CT from them (CT1)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After this point, Alice sends EK2 (the rest of the EK minus the Seed), while Bob sends CT1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bob eventually receives EK2, and uses it to generate the final portion of the CT (CT2)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once Alice tells Bob that she has received all of CT1, Bob sends Alice CT2. Alice sends nothing during this time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With both sides having all of the pieces of EK and the CT that they need, they extract their shared secret and increment their epoch&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are still places in this algorithm (specifically steps 2 and 6) where one side has nothing to send. But during those times, the other side has only a very small amount of information to send, so the duration of those steps is minimal compared to the rest of the process. Specifically, while the full EK is 37 chunks and the full CT is 34, the two pieces of the new protocol which must be sent without data being received (EK1 and CT2) are 2 and 4 chunks respectively, while the pieces that can be sent while also receiving (EK2 and CT1) are the bulk of the data, at 36 and 30 chunks respectively. Far more of our sending capacity is actually used with this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that all of this is just to perform a quantum-safe key exchange that gives us a secret we can mix into the bigger protocol. To help us organize our code, our security proofs, and our understanding better we treat this process as a standalone protocol that we call the ML-KEM Braid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work was greatly aided by the authors of the libcrux-ml-kem Rust library, who graciously exposed the APIs necessary to work with this incremental version of ML-KEM 768. With this approach completed, we’ve been able to really efficiently use the sending capacity of messages sent between two parties to share secrets as quickly as possible without exposing secrets from multiple epochs to potential attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mixing Things Up - The Triple Ratchet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of details to add to make sure that we reached every corner - check those out in our online protocol documentation - but this basic idea lets us build secure messaging that has post-quantum FS and PCS without using up anyone’s data. We’re not done, though! Remember, at the beginning of this post we said we wanted post-quantum security without taking away our existing guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While today’s Double Ratchet may not be quantum safe, it provides a high level of security today and we believe it will continue to be strong well into the future. We aren’t going to take that away from our users. So what can we do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our answer ends up being really simple: we run both the Double Ratchet and the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet alongside each other and mix their keys together, into what we’re calling the Triple Ratchet protocol. When you want to send a message you ask both the Double Ratchet and SPQR “What encryption key should I use for the next message?” and they will both give you a key (along with some other data you need to put in a message header). Instead of either key being used directly, both are passed into a Key Derivation Function - a special function that takes random-enough inputs and produces a secure cryptographic key that’s as long as you need. This gives you a new “mixed” key that has hybrid security. An attacker has to break both our elliptic curve and ML-KEM to even be able to distinguish this key from random bits. We use that mixed key to encrypt our message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Receiving messages is just as easy. We take the message header - remember it has some extra data in it - and send it to the Double Ratchet and SPQR and ask them “What key should I use to decrypt a message with this header?” They both return their keys and you feed them both into that Key Derivation Function to get your decryption key. After that, everything proceeds just like it always has.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Heterogeneous Rollout&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we’ve got this new, snazzy protocol, and we want to roll it out to all of our users across all of their devices… but none of the devices currently support that protocol. We roll it out to Alice, and Alice tries to talk to Bob, but Alice speaks SPQR and Bob doesn’t. Or we roll it out to Bob, but Alice wants to talk to Bob and Alice doesn’t know the new protocol Bob wants to use. How do we make this work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about the simplest option: allowing downgrades. Alice tries to establish a session with Bob using SPQR and sends a message over it. Bob fails to read the message and establish the session, because Bob hasn’t been upgraded yet. Bob sends Alice an error, so Alice has to try again. This sounds fine, but in practice it’s not tenable. Consider what happens if Alice and Bob aren’t online at the same time… Alice sends a message at 1am, then shuts down. Bob starts up at 3am, sends an error, then shuts down. Alice gets that error when she restarts at 5am, then resends. Bob starts up at 7am and finally gets the message he should have received at 3am, 4 hours behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To handle this, we designed the SPQR protocol to allow itself to downgrade to not being used. When Alice sends her first message, she attaches the SPQR data she would need to start up negotiation of the protocol. Noticing that downgrades are allowed for this session, Alice doesn’t mix any SPQR key material into the message yet. Bob ignores that data, because it’s in a location he glosses over, but since there’s no mixed in keys yet, he can still decrypt the message. He sends a response that lacks SPQR data (since he doesn’t yet know how to fill it in), which Alice receives. Alice sees a message without SPQR data, and understands that Bob doesn’t speak SPQR yet. So, she downgrades to not using it for that session, and they happily talk without SPQR protection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s some scary potential problems here… let’s work through them. First off, can a malicious middleman force a downgrade and disallow Alice and Bob from using SPQR, even if both of them are able to? We protect against that by having the SPQR data attached to the message be MAC’d by the message-wide authentication code - a middleman can’t remove it without altering the whole message in such a way that the other party sees it, even if that other party doesn’t speak SPQR. Second, could some error cause messages to accidentally downgrade sometime later in their lifecycle, due either to bugs in the code or malicious activity? Crucially, SPQR only allows a downgrade when it first receives a message from a remote party. So, Bob can only downgrade if he receives his first message from Alice and notices that she doesn’t support SPQR, and Alice will only downgrade if she receives her first reply from Bob and notices that he doesn’t. After that first back-and-forth, SPQR is locked in and used for the remainder of the session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, those familiar with Signal’s internal workings might note that Signal sessions last a really long time, potentially years. Can we ever say “every session is protected by SPQR”, given that SPQR is only added to new sessions as they’re being initiated? To accomplish this, Signal will eventually (once all clients support the new protocol) roll out a code change that enforces SPQR for all sessions, and that archives all sessions which don’t yet have that protection. After the full rollout of that future update, we’ll be able to confidently assert complete coverage of SPQR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One nice benefit to setting up this “maybe downgrade if the other side doesn’t support things” approach is that it also sets us up for the future: the same mechanisms that allow us to choose between SPQR or no-SPQR are designed to also allow us to upgrade from SPQR to some far-future (as yet unimagined) SPQRv2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making Sure We Get It Right&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complex protocols require extraordinary care. We have to ensure that the new protocol doesn’t lose any of the security guarantees the Double Ratchet gives us. We have to ensure that we actually get the post-quantum protection we’re aiming for. And even then, after we have full confidence in the protocol, we have to make sure that our implementation is correct and robust and stays that way as we maintain it. This is a tall order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make sure we got this right, we started by building the protocol on a firm foundation of fundamental research. We built on the years of research the academic community has put into secure messaging and we collaborated with researchers from PQShield, AIST, and NYU to explore what was possible with post-quantum secure messaging. In a paper at Eurocrypt 25 we introduced erasure code based chunking and proposed the high-level Triple Ratchet protocol, proving that it gave us the post-quantum security we wanted without taking away any of the security of the classic Double Ratchet. In a follow up paper at USENIX 25, we observed that there are many different ways to design a post-quantum ratchet protocol and we need to pick the one that protects user messages the best. We introduced and analyzed six different protocols and two stood out: one is essentially SPQR, the other is a protocol using a new KEM, called Katana, that we designed just for ratcheting. That second one is exciting, but we want to stick to standards to start!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Formal Verification From the Start&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research gave us the framework to think about protocol design and prove protocols are secure, but there is a big leap from an academic paper to code. Already when designing PQXDH - a much simpler protocol! - we found that formal verification was an important tool for getting the details right. With the Triple Ratchet we partnered with Cryspen and made formal verification part of the process from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we kept finding better protocol candidates - and we implemented around a dozen of them - we modeled them in ProVerif to prove that they had the security properties we needed. Rather than wrapping up a protocol design and performing formal verification as a last step we made it a core part of the design process. Now that the design is settled, this gives us machine verified proof that our protocol has the security properties we demand from it. We wrote our Rust code to closely match the ProVerif models, so it is easy to check that we’re modeling what we implement. In particular, ProVerif is very good at reasoning about state machines, which we’re already using, making the mapping from code to model much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are taking formal verification further than that, though. We are using hax to translate our Rust implementation into F* on every CI run. Once the F* models are extracted, we prove that core parts of our highly optimized implementation are correct, that function pre-conditions and post-conditions cannot be violated, and that the entire crate is panic free. That last one is a big deal. It is great for usability, of course, because nobody wants their app to crash. But it also matters for correctness. We aggressively add assertions about things we believe must be true when the protocol is running correctly - and we crash the app if they are false. With hax and F*, we prove that those assertions will never fail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Formal Verification Doesn’t Freeze Our Progress&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often when people think about formally verified protocol implementations, they imagine a one-time huge investment in verification that leaves you with a codebase frozen in time. This is not the case here. We re-run formal verification in our CI pipeline every time a developer pushes a change to GitHub. If the proofs fail then the build fails, and the developer needs to fix it. In our experience so far, this is usually as simple as adding a pre- or postcondition or returning an error when a value is out of bounds. For us, formal verification is a dynamic part of the development process and ensures that the quality is high on every merge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TLDR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signal is rolling out a new version of the Signal Protocol with the Triple Ratchet. It adds the Sparse Post-Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR, to the existing Double Ratchet to create a new Triple Ratchet which gives our users quantum-safe messaging without taking away any of our existing security promises. It’s being added in such a way that it can be rolled out without disruption. It’s relatively lightweight, not using much additional bandwidth for each message, to keep network costs low for our users. It’s resistant to meddling by malicious middlemen - to disrupt it, all messages after a certain time must be dropped, causing a noticeable denial of service for users. We’re rolling it out slowly and carefully now, but in such a way that we’ll eventually be able to say with confidence “every message sent by Signal is protected by this.” Its code has been formally verified, and will continue to be so even as future updates affect the protocol. It’s the combined effort of Signal employees and external researchers and contributors, and it’s only possible due to the continued work and diligence of the larger crypto community. And as a user of Signal, our biggest hope is that you never even notice or care. Except one day, when headlines scream “OMG, quantum computers are here”, you can look back on this blog post and say “oh, I guess I don’t have to care about that, because it’s already been handled”, as you sip your Nutri-Algae while your self-driving flying car wends its way through the floating tenements of Megapolis Prime.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Those that are interested can look at https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.203.pdf and note that Algorithm 17 uses randomness plus the hash of EK to generate a shared secret and random value, then that random value is used in Algorithm 14 to create c1. The rest of ekPKE is only used by Algorithm 14 to generate c2. ↩&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Playball can be configured using the &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; subcommand. To list the current configuration values run the subcommand with no additional arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;playball config&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should see output similar to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;color.ball = green
color.favorite-star = yellow
color.in-play-no-out = blue
color.in-play-out = white
color.in-play-runs-bg = white
color.in-play-runs-fg = black
color.on-base = yellow
color.other-event = white
color.out = red
color.strike = red
color.strike-out = red
color.walk = green
favorites = 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get the value of a single setting pass the key as an additional argument:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;playball config color.strike&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To change a setting pass the key and value as arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;playball config color.strike blue&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To revert a setting to its default value provide the key and the &lt;code&gt;--unset&lt;/code&gt; flag:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;playball config color.strike --unset&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This table summarizes the available settings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;color.ball&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Color of dots representing balls in top row of game view&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;green&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;One of the following: &lt;code&gt;black&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;green&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;blue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;magenta&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cyan&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;white&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grey&lt;/code&gt;. Any of those colors may be prefixed by &lt;code&gt;bright-&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;light-&lt;/code&gt; (for example &lt;code&gt;bright-green&lt;/code&gt;). The exact color used will depend on your terminal settings. The value &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; may be used to specify the default text color for your terminal. Finally hex colors (e.g &lt;code&gt;#FFA500&lt;/code&gt;) can be specified. If your terminal does not support true color, the closest supported color may be used.&lt;/cell&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why I chose Lua for this blog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog used to run using with a stack based on Racket using Pollen and lots of hacks on top of it. At some point I realised that my setup was working against me. The moving parts and workflow I created added too much friction to keep my blog active. That happened mostly because it was a static generator trying to behave as if it was dynamic website with an editing interface. That can be done really well â cue Grav CMS â but that was not the case for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I decided to rewrite this blog as a simpler system, I faced the dilema of what stack to choose. The obvious choice for me would be Javascript, it is the language I use more often and one that I am quite confortable with. Still, I don't think it is a wise choice for the kind of blog I want to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talking to some friends recently, I noticed that many people I know that have implemented their own blogging systems face many challenges keeping them running over many years. Not because it is hard to keep software running, but because their stack of choice is moving faster than their codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This problem is specially prevalent in the Javascript world. It is almost a crime that JS as understood by the browser is this beautiful language with extreme retrocompatibility, while JS as understood and used by the current tooling and workflows is this mess moving at lightspeed. Let me unpack that for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can open a web page from 1995 on your browser of choice and it will just work because browser vendors try really hard to make sure they don't break the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers who built the whole ecosystem of NodeJS, NPM, and all those libraries and frameworks don't share the same ethos. They all make a big case of semantic versioning and thus being able to handle breaking changes, but they have breaking changes all the time. You'd be hardpressed to actually run some JS code from ten years ago based on NodeJS and NPM. There is a big chance that dependencies might be gone, broken, or it might be incompatible with the current NodeJS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I know this sounds like FUD, and that for many many projects, maybe even most projects, that will not be the case. But I heard from many people that keeping their blogging systems up to date requires a lot more work than they would like to do and if they don't, then they're screwed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is also true about other languages even though many of them move at a slower speed. A friend recently complained about a blogging system he implemented that requires Ruby 2.0 and that keeping that running sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want a simpler blogging system; one that requires minimal changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Now we talk about Lua&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lua is a wonderful and nimble language that is often misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One characteristic that I love about it, is that is evolves very slowly. Lua 5.1 was introduced in 2006, Lua 5.4 which is the current version initial release was in 2020. Yes, there are point released in between, but you can see how much slower it moves when compared to JS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The differences between Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.4 are minimal when compared with how much other languages changed in the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lua only requires a C89 compiler to bootstrap itself. It is very easy to make Lua work and even easier to make it interface with something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JS is a lot larger than Lua, there is more to understand and more to remember. My blog needs are very simple and Lua can handle them with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How this blog works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an old-school blog. I uses cgi-bin â aka Comon Gateway Interface â scripts to run it. It is a dynamic website with a SQLite database holding its data. When you open a page, it fetches the data from a database and assembles a HTML to send to the browser using Mustache templates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One process per request. Like the old days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might argue that if I went with NodeJS, I'd be able to serve more requests using fewer resources. That is true. I don't need to serve that many requests though. My peak access was a couple years ago with 50k visitors on a week, even my old Racket blog could handle that fine. The Lua one should handle it too; and if it breaks it breaks. I'm a flawed human being, my code can be flawed too, we're in this together, holding hands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your blog is your place to experiment and program how you want it. You can drop the JS fatigue, you can drop your fancy Haskell types, you can just do whatever you find fun and keep going (and that includes JS and Haskell if that's your thing. You do you).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cause I'm using Lua, I don't have as many libraries and frameworks available to me as JS people have, but I still have quite a large collection via Luarocks. I try not to add many dependencies to my blog. At the moment there are about ten and that is mostly because Lua is a batteries-not-included language so you start from a minimal core and build things up to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a lot of things I went with the questionable choice of implementing things myself. I got my own little CGI library. It is 200 lines long and does the bare minimum to make this blog work. I got my own little libraries for many things. Micropub and IndieAuth were all implemented by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the moment I'm &lt;del&gt;despairing&lt;/del&gt;&lt;del&gt;frustrated&lt;/del&gt; having a lot of fun implementing WebMentions. Doing the Microformats2 &lt;del&gt;exorcism&lt;/del&gt; extraction on my own is teaching me a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I want to say is that by choosing a small language that moves very slowly and very few dependencies, I can keep all of my blogging system in my head. I can make sure it will run without too much change for the next ten or twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lua is a lego set, a toolkit, it adapts to you and your needs. I don't need to keep chasing the new shiny or the latest framework du jour. I can focus on making the features I want and actually understanding how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of installing a single dependency in another language and it pulling a hundred of other small dependencies all of which were transpiled into something the engine understands to the point that understanding how all the pieces work and fit together takes more time than to learn a new language, I decided to keep things simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got 29 Luarocks installed here and that is for all my Lua projects in this machine. That is my blog, my game development, my own work scripts for my day job. Not even half of those are for my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I often see wisdom in websites such as Hacker News and Lobsters around the idea of "choosing boring" because it is proven, safe, easier to maintain. I think that boring is not necessarily applicable to my case. I don't find Lua boring at all, but all that those blog posts talk about that kind of mindset are all applicable to my own choices here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next time you're building your own blogging software, consider for a bit for how long do you want to maintain it. I first started blogging on macOS 8 in 2001. I choose badly many times and in the end couldn't keep my content moving forward in time with me as softwares I used or created became impossible to run. The last two changes: from JS to Racket and from Racket to Lua have been a lot safer and I managed to carry all my content forward into increasingly simpler setups and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My blogging system is not becoming more complex over the years, it is becoming smaller, because with each change I select a stack that is more nimble and smaller than the one I had before. I don't think I can go smaller than Lua though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By small I mean:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A language I can fully understand and keep on my head.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A language that I know how to build the engine and can do it if needed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An engine that requires very few resources and is easy to interface with third-party libraries in native code.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I chose Lua because of all that, and I'm happy with it and hope this engine will see me through the next ten or so years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why I Keep Blogging With Emacs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time I look at someone’s simple static site generation setup for their blog, I feel a pang of envy. I’m sure I could make a decent blogging engine in 2,000 lines of code, and it would be something I’d understand, be proud over, able to extend, and willing to share with others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Instead, I write these articles in Org mode, and use mostly the standard Org publishing functions to export them to html. This is sometimes brittle, but most annoyingly, I don’t understand it. I have been asked for details on how my publishing flow works, but the truth is I have no idea what happens when I run the &lt;code&gt;org-publish-current-file&lt;/code&gt; command.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I could find out by tracing the evaluation of the Lisp code that runs on export, but I won’t, because just the html exporting code (&lt;code&gt;ox-html.el&lt;/code&gt;) is 5,000
lines of complexity. The general exporting framework (&lt;code&gt;ox-publish.el&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;ox.el&lt;/code&gt;) is 8,000 lines. The framework depends on Org parsing code
(&lt;code&gt;org-element.el&lt;/code&gt;) which is at least another 9,000 lines. This is over 20,000
lines of complexity I’d need to contend with.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might seem like a no-brainer to just write that 2,000 line custom static generator and use that instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except one thing: Babel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any lightweight markup format (like Markdown or ReStructuredText or whatever) allows for embedding code blocks, but Org, through Babel, can run that code on export, and then display the output in the published document, even when the output is a table or an image. It supports sessions that lets code reuse definitions from earlier code blocks. It allows for injecting variables from the markup into the code, and vice versa. As a bonus, Org doesn’t require a JavaScript syntax highlighter, because it generates inline styles in the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It does this for a large number of languages, although I mainly use it with R for drawing plots. Being able to do this is incredibly convenient, because it makes it trivial to draft data, illustrations, and text at the same time, adjusting both until the article coheres. Having tried it, I cannot see myself living without it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple 2,000 line blogging engine would be a fun weekend project. Mirroring the features of Babel I use would turn it into a multi-month endeavour for someone with limited time such as myself. Not going to happen, and I will continue to beat myself up for overcomplicating my publishing workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;English spelling has a reputation. And it’s not a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s full of silent letters, as in numb, knee, and honour. A given sound can be spelled in multiple ways (farm, laugh, photo), and many letters make multiple sounds (get, gist, mirage).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;English spelling is so complex that we’ve made mastering it into a competitive sport: what would be the point of a spelling bee in a language with a predictable spelling system? Where’s the fun unless you have to sweat a little as you struggle to recall whether this particular word is one where “‘i’ before ‘e’ except after ‘c’” doesn’t apply?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, English has a complicated writing system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve written about the origin of some of this complexity before, blaming everyone from the French to stingy printers and late medieval yuppies. But I’ve not yet plumbed the depths of this complexity. To do so, I will need to tell you the story of yogh,1 an obscure medieval letter whose rise and fall allows us to peer into this abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But like an Icelandic family saga, we begin not with the story of yogh, but with the story of its parent. So allow me to introduce you to the letter ‘g,’ which, as you’ll soon see, is a complicated letter in its own right, dating back to Old English.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It starts with the shape of the letter. When modern editors print Old English today, they print nice, modern-looking ‘g’s — that is, the ones we use today, with an open or closed loop on the bottom, depending on the typeface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This modern form of ‘g’ is called the Carolingian ‘g.’ It had its origin in the Carolingian minuscule, the script used by the scribes of the Carolingian Renaissance, the great revival of learning which flourished in the vast realm of Charlemagne (reigned 768–814).2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Old English scribes didn’t write their g-sounds with a Carolingian ‘g.’ The Old English letter ‘g’ was written in a form called the insular ‘g.’ Here’s what it looked like: ‘ᵹ.’ It’s like a mix between a ‘z’ and a ‘3.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see it in action. When the first lines of Beowulf are written in a modern edition, they look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hwæt, we Gardena in geardagum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;þeodcyninga þrym gefrunon,&lt;p&gt;‘How we have heard of the glory of the kings of the spear-Danes in days of old’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Beowulf 1–2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in the manuscript, they’re written like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;HǷÆT ǷE GARDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;na inᵹear daᵹum þeod cyninᵹa&lt;lb/&gt;þrym ᵹefrunon&lt;p&gt;London, British Library, Cotton MS Vitellius A XV, f. 132r.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, there’s clearly lots of other weird stuff going on in the manuscript, but focus on how the ‘g’ is represented. While the majuscule (capital) ‘G’ in ‘gardena’ is spelled more like a modern ‘g,’ all the others are insular ‘ᵹ.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Anglo-Saxons did use the Carolingian ‘g’ — just not for Old English. They used it when writing Latin, at least after the late 10th century. This was when the Church in England underwent a set of reforms, which caused a flowering of literature both in Latin and Old English.3 As part of these reforms, the Carolingian minuscule script was adopted for Latin texts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So for a period, both ‘g’ and ‘ᵹ’ were used in England, but generally speaking, each was used for writing the ‘g’ sound in a different language. Simple enough, but the stage was set for things to get a lot more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for that, we need the help of the Normans.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Of course, they would have spelled it ȝoȝ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the history of the English language, no single year was more momentous than 1066. In this year, William, Duke of Normandy, invaded and took the English throne, bringing with him Norman knights, and more importantly for our purposes, Norman scribes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These Norman scribes inherited the writing traditions that the Carolingian renaissance had given birth to. This meant the latest, greatest, 11th-century French versions of the Carolingian minuscule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These weren’t so different from the way Anglo-Saxon scribes had written Latin. But they were very different from the way they had written Old English, especially in the ‘g’ department.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that wasn’t so much of an issue, since these Norman-trained scribes, and those of the generations that came after them, didn’t write much English at all. In fact, writing in English of any kind was very scarce up until the end of the 12th century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of that tumultuous — and, for English, silent — century, the language had changed a great deal. All the scribes trained in the old, Anglo-Saxon traditions were long dead, so when a new generation of scribes turned their attention once again to English, they had to devise some new strategies for writing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this, after a surprisingly long delay, is where we first meet the star of today’s issue: ‘ȝ,’ also known as yogh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yogh is descended from a variant form of the old insular ‘ᵹ.’ But, while the insular ‘ᵹ’ was thought of as the same letter as the Carolingian ‘g’ in Anglo-Saxon times, the yogh ‘ȝ’ of the 12th century was an entirely different letter from the Carolingian-derived ‘g.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, stranger still, ‘ȝ’ was used to write two completely different sounds in Middle English, the form of English spoken from around 1100–1450: the y-sound as in young or yesterday, and another sound that English has lost altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other sound that ‘ȝ’ once spelled is the “harsh” or “guttural” sound made in the back of the mouth, which you hear in Scots loch or German Bach.4 This sound is actually the reason for the most famous bit of English spelling chaos: the sometimes-silent, sometimes-not sequence ‘gh’ that you see in laugh, cough, night, and daughter. Maybe one day I’ll tell you that story too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For today, however, just know that the spelling ‘gh,’ which causes spellers so much trouble, was originally a replacement for ‘ȝ’ in these words. But more on that later. Let’s dwell for a moment on the bizarre situation we had in Middle English, where the same letter ‘ȝ’ could represent either a y-sound or that now-vanished gh-sound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;But not as bizarre as this painting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or is it actually so bizarre?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern English spelling is, of course, chaotic. So perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that we too have a very yogh-like situation with two of our letters: ‘c’ and — wait for it — ‘g.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these regularly represents two not particularly similar sounds. The letter ‘c’ sometimes represents a k-sound, like in cat, and sometimes an s-sound, like in city. The letter ‘g’ is similar: sometimes it writes a true g-sound, like in good, but other times, what it represents is a j-sound, like in gem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If these sounds seem similar to you, pay attention to your tongue as you make each one: the k-sound and the true g-sound are made with the back of your tongue hitting against your soft palate. The s-sound and the ‘j’ sound are made in slightly different places, but in both cases, they use the tip of your tongue coming up against (or close to) just behind your upper teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of our two double-sounding letters, ‘c’ and ‘g,’ has two variants, which are made at completely different ends of the mouth. This is how yogh worked too: it had one variant made at the back of the mouth (the gh-sound) and the other made towards the front (that’s the y-sound).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s actually a good linguistic reason why this pattern keeps happening. It’s a sound change called palatalization: this happens when a sound made towards the back of the mouth, like a k- or g-sound, gets pulled forward because it’s next to another sound made at the front of the mouth. Often, these front-of-the-mouth sounds are vowels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Old English, these front-of-the-mouth vowels (front vowels for short) included the ones spelled ‘i’ and ‘e,’ which sounded like the vowels in bee and bay.5 Sometime in the deep prehistory of the English language, the ‘g’ sound got pulled forward in the mouth to sound like ‘y’ whenever it was next to these front vowels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when it came time to spell these ‘y’ sounds in the Latin alphabet, they still seemed to the Anglo-Saxon scribes to be versions of ‘g’ sounds. So they spelled them ‘ᵹ’ just like they spelled other ‘g’ sounds. This is why, when you read Old English, you can often replace ‘ᵹ’ (or ‘g’ in modern editions) with ‘y’ and get recognizable Modern English words: ᵹear is year, dæᵹ is day, weᵹ is way.6&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A process like this happened in the ancestor of French too, just slightly differently. Instead of the ‘g’ being pulled forward into a ‘y’ sound before ‘i’ and ‘e,’ it got pulled forward into a ‘j’ sound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why the Modern English ‘g’ represents two sounds, one before the letters ‘i’ and ‘e’, and the other before the other letters. It’s because we took our spelling conventions from how the Norman scribes wrote their language, which was an old form of French.7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the Norman scribes, and the later English scribes they trained, were used to the letter ‘g’ writing two different sounds, neither was a y-sound. They needed another letter for that, and they found one: the old insular ‘ᵹ,’ or rather, its descendant, the yogh ‘ȝ.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that’s why ‘ȝ’ spelled a ‘y’ sound. To understand why ‘ȝ’ also spelled that vanished ‘gh’ sound, however, we need to go back into the distant history of English, long before it was ever written down. Actually, long before there even was an English.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back then, there was just one single language, which would later split into English, Dutch, German, Swedish, and all the other Germanic languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this Proto-Germanic language (as it’s called today), the sound that would become the English g-sound — which the Anglo-Saxons would later spell ‘ᵹ’ — was not the g-sound we have today in words like good or bag. That came later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, the Proto-Germanic ancestor of words like good had a sound very similar to the later Middle English gh-sound at the start.8 Only later would English harden that gh-sound into the g-sound we know today. But this only happened in certain places in the word, especially at the start. At the end of the word, the gh-sound remained. In Old English, both versions were spelled the same: ‘ᵹ.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that ‘ᵹ’ actually had three pronunciations in Old English, not two: the y-sound (next to front vowels), the g-sound (at the start of words), and the gh-sound (in the middle of words). So when those Norman-trained scribes turned their attention to writing English in the 12th century, they had no problem writing the g-sound at the start of words with ‘g.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when they wanted to write the gh-sound, they ran into the same problem they had in writing the y-sound. They didn’t have a good way to write the gh-sound, which didn’t exist in French at the time, so they pressed yogh into service again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s why yogh has two sounds, each of which corresponds to a pronunciation of the Old English letter ‘ᵹ’ that the French scribal tradition couldn’t accept writing with ‘g.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Wait, we’ve been saying ‘Mackenzie’ wrong?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you’re reading Middle English, it can get a bit confusing: Which kind of yogh is which?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at this line from Sir Gawain and the Green Knight:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Þaȝ ȝe ȝourself be talenttyf, to take hit to yourseluen,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;‘Though you yourself are eager to accept it [a challenge] personally,’ (Sir Gawain and the Green Knight 350)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this line, the first yogh makes the gh-sound, while the second and third represent y-sounds. But you just have to know the words in order to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As inconvenient as this confusion is for us modern readers of Middle English, that isn’t the reason yogh disappeared from the English language. The fate of yogh was sealed by a conspiracy of factors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is that yogh was never the only alternative for writing the sounds it wrote. The y-sound could also be written in the way the French wrote it, that is, ‘i’ or ‘y.’ The latter is the spelling that English ended up using for this sound, hence yourself instead of ȝourself. The gh-sound could also be written ‘h,’ ‘ȝh,’ or ‘gh.’ The last of these, of course, is what English ended up adopting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the death blow dealt to yogh was the printing press. The earliest printing press in England was a Flemish import, as were the typefaces. But the yogh letter was unique to English, and like the other letters unique to English, it would be expensive to print. And, as we just saw, there were ready alternatives, so yogh disappeared without a trace… from English.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Scotland, on the other hand, it stuck around for longer. Scots used the combination ‘lȝ’ to represent an ‘ly’ sequence like we have in million, and ‘nȝ’ to represent either the ‘ny’ sequence like in canyon, or an ‘ng’ sound like in singer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Scottish printers were more eager to keep it than English printers were. So they took advantage of the visual similarity between ‘ȝ’ and ‘z’ — most forms of cursive writing in English still write ‘z’ like ‘ȝ’ — to write their yoghs with ‘z’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You still see the results of this substitution, ‘lz’ and ‘nz,’ in certain Scottish names. But the ‘z’ has led them to be pronounced in ways that have nothing to do with their traditional forms. So Menzies and Mackenzie were meant to spell things that sounded more like Mingus and Mackenyie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s how one single letter of the Middle English alphabet ended up being pronounced like ‘y,’ ‘gh,’ or even eventually like ‘z.’ I warned you it would be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the journey through the history of yogh has allowed us to peer down some interesting side alleys of the history of writing, from Carolingian scribal practices to the compromises of Scottish printers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t lament the loss of yogh myself, not nearly as much as I lament the fate of other lost letters. But if the cause of yogh is one ȝou fancy taking up ȝourself, there’s nothing standing in ȝour waȝ (it’s included in many modern fonts), althouȝ I can imagine hiȝer causes to aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The name of the letter yogh is pronounced today in many ways: you can say it to rhyme with log, loch, or brogue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically, it was the double-storey, closed-loop ‘g’ that was associated with Carolingian minuscule. The open-loop, single-storey ‘g’ was a later development. Today, they’re seen as more or less interchangeable: in fact, I don’t even know what version you’re seeing when you read this, since it’ll look different on the web and in your email client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know phonetic terminology, I’ll be more specific: this sound was the voiceless velar fricative, or [x] in the International Phonetic Alphabet. In some situations, it was likely the voiceless palatal fricative (IPA [ç]).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to know why the names of these letters sound completely different in Modern English (‘i’ and ‘e’ sound more like the vowels in buy and bee), let me tell you all about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conscientious modern editors (myself included, he said humbly) will spell the ‘g’ that you’re supposed to pronounce like ‘y’ with a little dot on top: ‘ġ.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ditto for the two pronunciations of ‘c.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note for nerds: this was the voiced velar fricative [ɣ]. Yogh would later be used for the voiceless velar fricative [x], which actually had a different origin in the ancestor of Old English. But the two sounds ended up sounding identical at the end of a word, so yogh ended up being used for both.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1977, three new microcomputers appeared on the scene that broke free from the industry’s hobbyist roots: the Apple II, the Commodore PET, and the Tandy/Radio Shack TRS-80. Much later, in the 1990s, journalists and historians began reverently referring to this group as “the Trinity.” Though all three machines had different origins and different trajectories (Apple, for example, appeared in 1978 to be an also-ran before rising to eclipse all of its rivals), the distinctiveness of the 1977 generation of computers is not merely a retrospective imputation by later writers. The hobby journalists of the time recognized that with the Trinity, something like an “appliance” computer had arrived on the scene, “a clean break from commercial and hobbyist computer systems requiring technical skill and dedication from their operators into a consumer market where no qualifications are required of the customer.”[1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three factors were required to join this holy ensemble: the technical expertise to design a capable and reliable microcomputer, a nose for the larger business opportunity latent in the hobby computer market, and the capital resources to produce, market, and sell thousands (or even tens of thousands) of computers per month. Most of all it required a certain measure of daring, a willingness to a take a leap in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all, the transformation of the microcomputer hobby into a large-scale commercial enterprise came as a surprise to most outsiders. In 1977, the established mainframe and minicomputer makers remained cooly aloof from the microcomputer business. Clearly, computer enthusiasts had found in the Altair and its successors a fascinating gadget to occupy their spare hours. It did not necessarily follow that these toys had anything to do with the “real” computer business, any more than model rocketry had to do with putting a man on the moon. Two of the leading minicomputer makers, Hewlett-Packard and Digital, were offered ready-made micro designs by computing-loving engineers within their ranks (Steve Wozniak and Dave Ahl, respectively), but both rejected the idea, unwilling to pursue a fringe market that seemed to have nothing to do with their business.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even many of the hobbyists themselves didn’t believe that the market for a home computer would extend much beyond the existing circle of electronic hobbyists and computer enthusiasts. But a few people with access to deep pockets (not necessarily their own) smelled an opportunity in the microcomputer, and decided to pursue it, and those people formed the breaking edge of the second wave of personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The obvious place to start to tell the story of the second wave is Apple Computer: not because it is, retrospectively, the most well-known of the three, but because it had the deepest roots in the first-wave hobby community. Commodore and Tandy were well-established companies, dragged into the computer business almost against their will by internal agitators who believed fervently in the idea of the personal computer. Apple was founded by and for hobbyists. If not for the fickle whims of fate and the chutzpah of Steve Jobs, it would have met a quiet demise in total obscurity, like so many other hobby computer companies of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Apple Computer (later, simply Apple) continues to fascinate because of the company’s massive economic success and cultural impact (first in the early 1980s, then again in the twenty-first century), because of its meteoric rise from humble beginnings, and because of the vivid and contrasting personalities of its two primary co-founders: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. No other topic I will cover in this series has a comparably extensive literature: all of the known details of the early years of the two Steves and their company could fill more than one book (and have). Here we can note only the most important highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What became the first Apple computer began as an anonymous circuit board, the product of an intense burst of creative energy by Steven “Woz” Wozniak. Wozniak’s engineer father moved his family to Sunnyvale, California, at the southern end of San Francisco Bay, in the late 1950s, to take a job at Lockheed. The younger Wozniak developed an early fascination with electronics, and he came of age in the perfect environment to feed and reinforce that fascination: a suburban neighborhood teeming with engineer dads on every block, who had bins full of parts and minds full of expertise to lend to the eager young gadget enthusiasts who roamed the sidewalks.[3]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time Woz graduated from high school in 1968, he had grown into a true electronics genius, with a level of insight and skill far beyond the typical hobbyist. He could envision a design that would produce the desired effect in the most efficient way possible, with the elegant finality of a mathematical proof. Socially isolated, he lived an inward life of imagination, spending every spare moment at home and in school sketching designs for electronic systems. His social awkwardness dwelled side-by-side with a love of pranks and juvenile humor: in his early twenties he ran a Dial-a-Joke service out of his home that played pre-recorded Polack jokes from an answering machine.[4]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His high school electronics teacher gave Wozniak the opportunity to make weekly visits to a nearby corporate computer center, and he learned about minicomputers from the trade literature at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). Like many other young men of his generation, these brushes with computing got him pining for his own computer; unlike most of them, he decided to do something about it. In 1971, while a student at University of California, Berkeley, he built a home computer with the help of a younger friend, a high school student named Bill Fernandez. This “Cream Soda Computer,” named for the beverage that fueled its creation, was roughly similar in character and capabilities to the Kenbak-1 sold by John Blankenbaker that same year: a very basic processor, a tiny memory, and a handful of lights for output. Meanwhile, Woz continued to pore over the brochures and manuals for dream machines like the Data General Nova minicomputer, and to work out schematics on paper for minicomputers of his own design.[5]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, Wozniak’s dream of a computer to call his own slumbered. Then, in the spring of 1975, a sudden shock jolted it awake. His friend Allen Baum took Wozniak to the first Homebrew Computer Club meeting under false pretenses—he told Woz that the people there were working on computer video terminals like Don Lancaster’s TV Typewriter. Wozniak knew all about that: he had already designed his own terminal to use with a local time-sharing service, Call Computer. He was unprepared, then, when he arrived at Don French’s Menlo Park garage and found everyone chattering about microprocessors. Accustomed to mastery of all things electronic, Wozniak initially recoiled at being thrown into an environment that exposed him as ignorant.[6]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the meeting, though, he began looking into how these newfangled microprocessors worked, and found that they replicated the structure of his favorite minicomputers in miniature (indeed, the first Intel microprocessor was consciously modeled on the DEC PDP-8). Moreover, he saw that with a microprocessor, he could put a whole computer right in his TV terminal, and eliminate the need to actually “call” some outside computer.[7]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wozniak designed and built his second computer over the following months. For the processor, he opted at first for the Motorola 6800, but then found a much cheaper device with a similar design: the MOS Technology 6502, a new product that he acquired for $25 at the Western Electric Show and Convention (WESCON) at San Francisco’s Cow Palace, in June 1975. He assembled a circuit board around the processor with controller chips for a keyboard, TV screen, 4K bytes of static RAM, and a tiny program in ROM to bring up the keyboard interface at power on. Later in the year he upgraded to cheaper (but more finicky) dynamic RAM, with the help of his friend Steve Jobs, a classmate of Bill Fernandez.[8]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Had it been only up to Wozniak, the story of his computer would end there, as a minor anecdote in the history of hobby microcomputers. Proud of his accomplishment but shy of self-promotion, he would set up his computer at Homebrew meetings and wait patiently to lure in fellow hobbyists, to whom he would offer free copies of the plans for the machine. He found few takers. Wozniak’s design was clean and self-contained, but others were cobbling together the same capabilities by combining an Altair, a Processor Technology memory board, and a TV Typewriter. Moreover, using the 6502 processor put him out of step with the mainline hobby culture of Intel 8080 machines based on Altair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wozniak didn’t mind that at all. He had not designed his computer to fill a market need, but because he wanted it. Comfortably settled into his dream job—designing calculators for Hewlett-Packard (HP)—and into his first real romantic relationship (with Alice Robertson, whom he met through his Dial-a-Joke line), he was content with the direction of his life and felt no pull to parlay his talent for computer design into fame, recognition, or money. His young friend Steve Jobs, on the other hand, bristled with restless energy. Though he found electronics interesting, he lacked Wozniak’s all-consuming passion for the field, and did not know where to turn instead for fulfillment. Dissatisfied with the well-worn patterns around which others organized their lives, he spent his late teens and early twenties in search of some kind of vital spiritual awakening, whether through bizarre diets inspired by German-born writer Arnold Ehret, primal scream therapy, the ancient wisdom of India, or the All One Farm, a hippie commune in Oregon.[9]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jobs saw in Woz’s computer the potential for a business: instead of giving away the plans, they could sell the pre-assembled boards (with no case, keyboard, monitor, or other accessories). In early 1976, he cajoled his friend into a partnership; Woz agreed, but still considered this a sideline to his real work at HP. Inspired by the orchard at All One Farm where he had been spending much of his time, Jobs proposed the name Apple Computer. The partnership had a clear division of labor: Wozniak would design the hardware and software, Jobs would make the business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financed by the sale of their most valuable property (Jobs’ Volkswagen bus and Wozniak’s HP calculator), and thirty-day credit with a parts supplier, they made a fifty-computer deal with Paul Terrell, owner of the Byte Shop computer store. But this promising beginning also turned out to also be the end of their success; very few other Apples were sold. By mid-1976, the barebones board offered by Apple didn’t cut it anymore. A hobbyist could order a Processor Technology Sol-20 that came in a handsome case with integrated power supply, keyboard and cassette interface. Even when outfitted with all of that (which Terrell had to do himself in order to make a saleable computer), the Apple lacked compatibility with the growing array of software and hardware designed for the 8080 processor and S-100 bus.[10]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jobs knew that they would need a better computer and more money to build it. In late 1976, Woz lost himself in a second design. While he had built the first Apple so he could finally have a minicomputer of his own, he built the Apple II so he could create and play arcade games with full-color graphics. Woz knew the field well, because Jobs had an on-again, off-again job at Atari in Sunnyvale and Woz had taken a commission from his friend to design a Breakout game for the company—a single-player Pong variant, with the goal to break a whole array of blocks before losing the ball off the bottom of the screen. Unlike the Atari games of the time, though, Apple II games would be written in mutable BASIC code, not fossilized in hardware. As usual for Woz, the Apple II’s design was spare and efficient. The pièce de resistance was circuitry to time-share the memory bus so that the video card could read from memory while drawing each line of the screen, then hand control to the processor while waiting for the cathode ray beam to reset to the start of the next line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jobs, meanwhile, went to work on finding an investor. He tried selling Apple Computer to Atari and Commodore (a calculator firm about which we’ll have much more to say very shortly), but the former had no interest in the product and the latter balked at the price. Jobs asked Atari founder Bushnell (his former employer) for an investment, and was rebuffed again. But Bushnell did ask venture capitalist Don Valentine to come take a look at Apple. Valentine was turned off by Jobs’ hippie vibes, but put Jobs in touch with a former employee of his from his Fairchild Semiconductor days, Mike Markkula.[11]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through this chain of happenstance, Apple Computer found exactly the right person to make it a success. Jobs exhibited taste and enterprise, but untempered by experience and marred by streaks of cruelty and pettiness. Wozniak possessed exceptional engineering talent, but entirely lacked business sense, and avoided any work that he didn’t find personal interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Markkula was an even-keeled veteran of Fairchild and intel, living in semi-retirement in his thirties after making several million dollars off of his stock. He brought to Apple $250,000 of his own money, and the connections to bring in far more. He also brought knowledge about how to build and develop a company, and a deep belief in the market for something like the Apple. Markkula was already personally invested in the idea of computing at home: at Intel he had used a home teletype terminal to connect to an Intel time-sharing computer. He used it for company business but also to balance his personal checkbook, and had always wondered why Intel didn’t package the 8008 or 8080 into a computer and sell it.[12]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the spring of 1977, the Apple II was ready to sell. Wozniak had finished the circuit design, Markkula had laid out a business plan, and Jobs had selected, a sleek, molded-plastic case that would make Apple II the most elegant-looking computer on the market. At a starting price of $1,298, it was far from the cheapest, however, and its novel processor and bus still put it outside the mainstream of hobby hardware and software. Sales were initially slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Markkula kept the investment money flowing, and coaxed one last engineering miracle from Woz. Having ported his checkbook program to the Apple II, Markkula was annoyed at how long it took to load from cassette tape, and gave Wozniak the mandate to produce a magnetic disk drive for the Apple II, using the new 5.25 inch drives available from Shugart Associates. A floppy disk of the time could hold less data than a tape, but the computer could read and write it far faster and could instantly access any part of the rapidly-spinning disk (whereas tape could only be read or written at whatever position it was currently wound to).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The $595 Disk II immediately set Apple apart from its competitors, and set the stage for the company’s future growth. With the disk drive, color graphics, eight expansion slots, and the capacity for up to forty-eight kilobytes of memory, the Apple II was by far the most fully-featured and extensible of the Trinity. In 1977 and 1978, however, Apple Computer remained an also-ran. Other companies, with pre-existing manufacturing and distribution networks, raced ahead of with mass-market computers at half the price and many times the reach. They put up sales and production numbers far exceeding anything that the hobby computer market had ever seen. The first of these was Commodore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Commodore&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commodore, co-founded by Jack Tramiel and Manfred Kapp, began life as a typewriter importer in Toronto, but pivoted into the calculator business in the late 1960s, selling re-branded Japanese imports from Casio and then later building its own factories, with the backing of Canadian financier Irving Gould.[13]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tramiel, born Idek Trzmiel in Poland, survived Auschwitz and came to the U.S. in his early twenties, where he worked his way up from the bottom. Not much of an idea man or product innovator, he got ahead on hard work, a hard nose, and ruthlessness (this adjective is attributed to him seven times by various persons in Brian Bagnall’s book, Commodore: A Company on the Edge). Behind him lurked the shadowy Canadian financier Gould, who brought large quantities of cash, international contacts, and clever tax evasion schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like most North American calculator makers, Commodore found itself on the brink of disaster in 1974, after semiconductor firms like Texas Instruments began to flood the market with dirt-cheap calculators. Tramiel (now CEO of Commodore) decided to beat them by joining them: he vertically integrated by buying one of his suppliers, MOS Technology, the very firm that had built the 6502 processor used in the Apple I and II. Once again, we find a thread woven into the story of the personal computer out of the unraveling fabric of the North American calculator business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tramiel acquired MOS in September 1976 in exchange for a modest dollop of cash, a more substantial stake in Commodore, and a generous serving of pressure on his (also financially beleaguered) supplier.[14] In the bargain he had also acquired Charles “Chuck” Peddle, whose vision for the future of computing would pull Commodore in an entirely new direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cocky striver from a poor family in Maine, Peddle studied electrical engineering at the state university, then began bouncing around the country in search of bigger and better opportunities: to California to take a job at General Electric (GE), then to GE’s time-sharing systems division offices in Arizona and Ohio, then back to Arizona to take a swing at starting a smart terminal business, miss, and join the semiconductor design team at Motorola, then to Pennsylvania to join MOS Technology as part of a breakaway group of engineers who had worked on Motorola’s 6800 microprocessor. In contrast to the introverted Woz and the otherworldly Jobs, Peddle was brash and frankly carnal—the type of man who would compare the pleasures of computer use to sex and boast that his wife had the figure of Zsa Zsa Gabor.[15]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peddle helped to design the 6502 processor, but it was never targeted at microcomputers. It was designed as a controller for some larger application, such as an industrial machine, a traffic signal, or an automobile. At a price point of $25, it aimed to compete with the Intel 4040, the recently released successor to the 4004. MOS also sold the KIM-1, a single-board computer with a calculator screen and keypad built into it. It was intended as a marketing showpiece for the 6502, not a consumer product. Nonetheless, it sold in surprisingly large numbers to hobbyists who appreciated having a very inexpensive all-in-one computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 1975, Peddle was visiting the Miami suburbs to help Allied Leisure, a maker of electro-mechanical arcade games, design a microprocessor-powered pinball machine using the 6502. Peddle discovered that one of the Allied engineers, Bill Seiler, was a hobbyist who had bought a computer from the Digital Group in Denver, but then struggled to figure out what to do with it.[16]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peddle decided he wanted to launch a full-fledged computer product: not because he had always dreamed of a computer of his own, but because he believed in the market opportunity, having witnessed both the not-quite-satisfied demand of hobbyists like Seiler for a computer that was both easy-to-use and able to do something useful, and the eagerness with which those same hobbyists had taken up the cheap, simple KIM-1. Up to this time, the microcomputer business was almost fully autochthonous, built by native hobbyists; Peddle was the first immigrant. With MOS scaling back under financial pressure, Peddle intended to jump ship for Allied Leisure, which had agreed to launch his planned computer. But then, in the fall of 1976, came the Commodore acquisition.[17]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commodore’s vice president of engineering, Andre Sousan, later a major player at Apple, didn’t want to lose Peddle, and agreed to help him pitch his computer to Tramiel. Tramiel, in turn, agreed to give Peddle a computer division in Palo Alto. Sousan and Peddle succeeded with Tramiel because they framed the project in terms of the familiar calculator market: as historian Brian Bagnall writes, “[they] pitched the product as an evolution of the calculator which would surpass the HP65,” adding new features like a TV monitor and cassette deck. Tramiel especially appreciated the idea of having electronics retailer Radio Shack market the computer under its own brand, in exchange for more Commodore calculator distribution in their stores.[18]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tramiel wanted something to show at the January 1977 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), just a few months away, so Peddle went to Apple, the only existing company with a working 6502-based computer, to try to acquire their design. As we have seen, those negotiations went nowhere, so Peddle and his team slapped the guts of a 6502-based sprinkler-system controller into a case with a rubberized keyboard sourced from Commodore’s existing calculator designs. Unimpressed by a demo of this barely-working machine at CES, Radio Shack decided they could do at least as well themselves, and broke off negotiations, too.[19]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commodore went ahead alone, and announced the imminent arrival of the “Commodore PET 2001” – its name inspired by the pet rock fad, and its numerical designation borrowed from the space odyssey. Peddle built hype for the machine with an early prototype at the West Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco in April 1977, and the mob of over ten thousand attendees convinced Tramiel that this computer idea was something more than just a means of selling more calculators. As company revenues from calculators continued to dwindle, Tramiel kept the company afloat by transforming the excitement for the PET into cash flow with an advanced payment plan that secured eager buyers a place in line—once the computers were actually built.[20]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1977, Commodore finally began to ship PETs to customers. The resulting computer had serious shortcomings. Tramiel had refused to pay the up-front cost for a modern-looking plastic-molded exterior, instead funneling some revenue to his struggling file cabinet subsidiary by ordering sheet metal cases. He also insisted on a calculator-style keyboard with small rubberized keys, which proved unpleasantly cramped and flimsy. With black-and-white character graphics and no expansion slots or speaker, the PET was neither as handsome nor (in most ways) as capable as the Apple II. But it held two decided advantages: Commodore’s existing retail distribution network and a lower price. An 8KB model with integrated tape deck and monitor included cost just $795—two-thirds the price of an Apple II without those accessories.[21]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PET continued to attract attention from the press that fall, with an article in BYTE touting it as an “appliance computer,” extensive coverage in Personal Computing, and a cover feature in Popular Science. At first production failed to keep up with interest: “By the end of 1977,” Bagnall writes, “Commodore had only managed to assemble a meager 500 machines.” But Commodore straightened out its production lines, and by one estimate they sold about 25,000 PETs in 1978.[22]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Commodore remained in a slightly uncomfortable position. Peddle had tried and failed to a launch a disk drive for the PET, in large part because his lack of understanding of the hobby market led him to overshoot, aiming for a complex dual-disk drive that would appeal to the kind of corporate mini-computer user that he used to be (His failure incurred Tramiel’s wrath, leading Peddle to rashly jump ship to Apple –a move that wouldn’t last.) So, on the one hand, with no color graphics, limited memory, and no disk drive, the PET could not compete for the high-end customers who wanted those capabilities and could find them in an Apple II. On the other, Commodore had failed to dominate the market for low-cost, mass-produced machines either: the PET’s 1978 sales would have made it the fastest-selling computer of all time, if not for the final entry in the 1977 Trinity, the TRS-80.[23]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Radio Shack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tandy Radio Shack was the creation of Charles Tandy, a driven World War II veteran from Brownsville, Texas, who expanded his father’s Forth Worth shoe leather business into a nationally-known leather and leathercrafts empire. By the 1960s, Tandy felt that leather had taken him as far as it could; he wanted to expand into new markets with more growth potential. So, in 1963, he acquired an ailing electronics chain headquartered in Boston called Radio Shack. Pouring money from the leather business into his new venture, he expanded Radio Shack from just nine stores to several thousand over the following decade. Customers could walk into a Radio Shack in nearly every city in the United States, from Eugene, Oregon to Fort Lauderdale, Florida: even sparsely populated states like Montana and Wyoming boasted several stores each. This ubiquity provided the springboard for the TRS-80’s success.[24]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The impetus for Tandy’s entry into the computer business came from a hobbyist on the inside. Don French started his career as a teenage salesman in a Radio Shack store outside San Diego and rose rapidly through the ranks to become a project manager at the Fort Worth headquarters in 1973, while still in his mid-twenties. His fascination with computers was sparked by a course on the topic he took at Grossmont Junior College, and kindled anew by the arrival of the first hobby computers. He ordered the Mark-8 kit from Jonathan Titus in 1974, and then the MITS Altair when it became available the following year. French, enamored with his new toys, became convinced that Radio Shack should bring out its own kit computer, and tried earnestly to convince his bosses of the same.[25]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leadership gradually came around to the idea that an expensive, innovative computer product offered an opportunity to revise Radio Shack’s image as a purveyor of low-cost, low-quality, imitative merchandise. According to French, the key turning point came in the fall of 1975, when audio equipment maker Advent wowed the market with a new speaker design. An infuriated Charles Tandy railed at the fact that his company couldn’t innovate like that, and latched onto French’s computer proposal as a way to make similar headlines. His passion for the idea could not have run too deep, however, because French’s plans for a Radio Shack computer went nowhere until the spring of 1976.[26]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that time, a group of Tandy Radio Shack buyers including John Roach (Radio Shack’s Vice President) visited National Semiconductor in Santa Clara, California, to check out the latest chip offerings, including the company’s new SC/MP microprocessor. While there, they met a young electrical engineer named Steve Leininger. Then, when they visited the local Byte Shop to scope out the hobby computer scene, there was Leininger again, working a part-time gig behind the counter. Leininger, as it turned out, in addition to his engineering credentials, regularly attended Homebrew Computer Club meetings and was spending his spare hours building a hobby computer and writing his own BASIC. Tandy had found the perfect man to kick-off French’s computer project, combining a passion for hobby computers with the engineering chops to understand the nuances of integrated circuits and microprocessor design. The opportunity to design a computer as a commercial product and access to a better job market for his out-of-work geologist wife were sufficient enticements to bring Leininger to Texas.[27]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leininger grew up near South Bend, Indiana, and earned a bachelor and master’s degree in electric engineering in just four years at Purdue University before accepting a job at National Semiconductor. He did not have the bold personality of Woz, Jobs, or even Peddle, but he certainly had the skills that Tandy needed. French’s notional computer project only began in earnest after Leininger’s move to Fort Worth in July 1976. However, most of the company’s leaders did not really believe that a computer would or could be a successful Radio Shack product, and they left Leininger toiling away in almost total isolation, first in a speaker plant at the Fort Worth stockyards, then in a saddle factory. [28]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took several months before Leininger even knew what he should build. French had initially planned on a kit, as kits fell within his preserve at Tandy, making it relatively easy to sneak by leadership. But in October he and Leininger agreed to develop a pre-assembled computer instead, at the insistence of Radio Shack president Lew Kornfeld. Kornfeld felt burnt by a recent digital clock kit, which precipitated a high rate of returns from customers unable to put it together, and didn’t want to send and even more complicated kit project out the door. It is likely at this moment of uncertainty that French turned to Tramiel and Peddle to explore having Commodore build the computer instead, a notion which fell through at CES in January 1977, likely because the Tandy people saw that Peddle had nothing better to offer than what Leininger had prototyped to that point.[29]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than general skepticism about the viability of a Radio Shack computer in the first place, the clearest message French and Leininger got from Tandy leadership was to keep the price as low as possible: the original target (under the kit plan) was a $195 retail price. Cost control guided the rest of the design. For example, Leininger’s choice of the Zilog Z80 microprocessor, an 8080-compatible architected by the same Federico Faggin who had led the design of that seminal Intel chip. It offered more built-in circuitry than its Intel predecessor, including circuitry for refreshing dynamic RAM. Because dynamic RAM was cheaper than static, this lowered the cost of building the TRS-80. To save more money on hardware, Leininger wrote software to generate the tones for saving data to tape rather than using a physical tone-generator circuit. Meanwhile, because RCA offered to provide a cheap black-and-white TV already finished in a plastic “Mercedes silver” case, Radio Shack let the tail wag the dog, and adopted the same color for the case of the computer and keyboard, housed as a single unit.[30]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 1977 French, Leininger, and Roach presented the prototype to Charles Tandy and got the go-ahead to enter production. French thought they could sell 50,000 units; Lew Kornfeld found that laughable and proposed building 1,000; Roach finalized the number at 3,500 units, enough to get better economies of scale from the factory and to use a computer to manage inventory in each store if they found no buyers.[31]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this continuing internal skepticism, the TRS-80 attracted tremendous interest when it was announced to the public at the Waldorf Hotel New York City on August 3rd, and even more so when French showed up with a working TRS-80s at the ComputerMania hobby computer convention in Boston, later that month. At just $600 for a monitor, keyboard, cassette recorder, four kilobytes of memory, and a simple built-in BASIC, it was substantially cheaper even than the recently-debuted PET. Just like Commodore, it took Radio Shack several more months to get their factory production lines humming, but once they did, Tandy sold TRS-80s at an astonishing rate: 100,000 in 1978, exceeding the number of minicomputers sold by all manufacturers combined that year (though certainly not coming close to their total dollar value). Rather than the flop that company leaders feared, it proved to be a vital new revenue source, accounting for 10% of Tandy’s revenue in 1978. The TRS-80 arrived just in time to take up the slack from the flagging citizens-band (CB) radio craze that had filled Radio Shack’s sails in the mid-1970s.[32]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These astonishing sales numbers are not explained by the TRS-80’s low price alone. It was also more physically accessible and visible to a broad audience than any computer before it. Radio Shack store managers across the United States set up a TRS-80, powered it on to the BASIC programming language prompt, and left it sitting out for anyone to play with. The experience that students, scientists, and engineers had been discovering and falling in love with in computer centers, labs, and offices for the previous decade became available to anyone who walked into a Radio Shack—and available to take home for just a few hundred dollars. Every electronic hobbyist who had not yet caught the computer bug was exposed every time they came into the store to pick up a few parts for a project, but so were millions of people who dropped in just to get some flashlight batteries or blank cassette tapes. One TRS-80 owner reported: “I discovered the magic of computers in a Radio Shack. My brother and I typed in a small sample program [10 INPUT “WHAT IS YOUR NAME”; A$:PRINT “HELLO,“A$ ] and I was absolutely astounded at what it did.” Others became Radio Shack bums, hanging out in the store all day for a chance to play with the computer.[33]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TRS-80, however, did little to shake Radio Shack’s reputation for cut-rate products: the nickname “TRASH-80” appeared in print in late 1978, and would dog the product line for the rest of its existence, fairly or not. All of the personal computers of this era were clumsy and feeble compared to their minicomputer counterparts. The TRS-80 at least had a proper keyboard, unlike the early PETs. But much about it did exude a particular cheapness, including a mediocre BASIC written by Leininger (Radio Shack, like the rest of the Trinity, ended having to go to MicroSoft for a better version) and a finicky tape controller. Worst of all was the $300 Expansion Interface released in 1978, with ports for connecting a printer and a disk drive, and space for up to 32 kilobytes of additional memory and an expansion card. You could not do anything serious with the TRS-80 without an Expansion Interface, but it was notoriously unreliable, causing reboots, freezes, and monitor glitches. Even the TRS-80 advertisements were cheap knock-offs of Apple’s, with the attractive models in high-end homes replaced by unprepossessing Tandy employees posing awkwardly in Tandy offices or their suburban Fort Worth kitchens.[34]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The culture of cheapness extended to French and Leininger, as well. As mere cogs in the Tandy corporate machine, they would never see the kind of monetary rewards that awaited the founders of Apple. French, at least, expected a promotion to vice presidency and a bonus from his work on the TRS-80, but was blocked by Radio Shack president Lew Kornfeld after Charles Tandy’s death in late 1978. Disgruntled, he left to start his own company, implementing the CP/M disk operating system for the TRS-80. Leininger stayed on for several more years, designing Radio Shack computers.[35]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Winnowing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1975 and 1976, a slew of hobby-entrepreneurs had founded companies to try to turn their love of computers into a living. As in so many new, innovation-driven markets, this early burst of entrepreneurial energy was followed by a brutal winnowing. The majority of the hobby computer companies collapsed by 1979, unable to survive in a suddenly much larger and more competitive market. [36]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MITS, though not founded as a hobby computer company, was the first to enter the market and also the first to leave. The company struggled to develop a focused and reliable line of products, and never really rose to the challenge of IMSAI, much less further waves of more powerful and easy-to-use computers. In May 1977, Roberts, who had tired of the business and wanted to cash in, sold MITS for six million dollars to Pertec, a maker of disk and tape drive systems. Most MITS employees disliked the new management. The best of them had already fled to MicroSoft or other ventures, or soon would (Dave Bunnell, for example, started the magazine Personal Computing). Pertec continued to make higher end microprocessor-based minicomputers into the 1980s, but retired the Altair in 1978, and never made another computer targeted at individuals.[37]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bill Millard’s IMSAI, as we have already seen, launched a dud of a second product and was sucked dry of cash to help fund Millard’s chain of ComputerLand retail stores. It went bankrupt in 1979. Millard continued his financial shenanigans for decades, and in the 1990s became a wanted man for over $100 million in unpaid taxes. Processor Technology simply froze, failing to update its Sol product line in response to the threats posed by the rise of the Trinity, and also met its demise in 1979.[38]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Digital Group of Denver had bet their company on a CPU-independent bus, the key product decision that made their computers attractive to hardcore electronic hobbyists who wanted to experiment with different processors. But this expensive and complicated setup also contributed to the company’s abysmal quality control, and new buyers began demanding to pay cash-on-delivery, not up front. This put Digital Group in a cash flow death spiral, and they, too declared bankruptcy in 1979 after a total of 3,000 computers sold.[39]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One hobby enterprise, as we know, survived by metamorphosing into a venture-capital-fueled bet on a large-scale personal computer market: Apple Computer. The other survivors found specialized niches unserved by the mass-market Trinity: Cromemco, for example, focused on delivering reliable, powerful, rigorously engineered hardware, and became the darling of the hardcore scientific computerist; Vector Graphics built turn-key business systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1975 and 1976, almost everyone entering the microcomputer business was attracted to it by their passion for the machines themselves; by 1978, with computers backed by deep-pocketed companies flying off of retail shelves, there was a new lure: the scent of money. Prior to that year, for example, almost every franchisee of the retailer ComputerLand was a computer-loving hobbyist. But after a Fortune magazine profile of the company ran in April, the franchise office was flooded with inquiries from businessmen and salesman with no prior interest in computers. For better and for worse, the microcomputer market was leaving its childhood, and its innocence was lost.[40]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even more money was in the offing for those who could figure out how best to market these dazzling devices: make them more accessible, make them more fun, or even convince buyers that they were actually useful. Our next few installments will focus on who was buying these computers in such large quantities, and what they wanted them for.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[29] The timeline of the TRS-80’s development has proved hard to pin down. My reconstruction of the timeline is anchored the very clear and precise dates given by Leininger in a 2024 interview: he started working for Tandy July 5th 1976, and demoed the computer to Tandy in February 1977. “Floppy Days 144 – Interview with Don French and Steve Leininger, Co-Designers of the TRS-80 Model I”, Floppy Days (Oct 27, 2024), https://floppydays.libsyn.com/floppy-days-144-interview-with-don-french-and-steve-leininger. In the same interview (and in other accounts), Don French places himself and John Roach at the West Coast Computer Faire before hiring Leininger to start working on the TRS-80, but with the first West Coast Computer Faire took place in April 1977, months after the prototype TRS-80 had already been demonstrated and approved for production by Charles Tandy. He also puts his conversations with Peddle at Commodore about possibly designing a computer for Radio Shack at a point before hiring, Leininger, but Peddle didn’t work for Commodore at that point. A 1981 article on Leininger gives an even more nonsensical timeline, in which Leininger leaves California to work for Tandy in the fall of 1975 (before the first Byte Shop, where he worked evenings, had even opened), chooses the Z80 in February 1976 (months before its release), and presents the prototype for Tandy’s approval in April 1976 for delivery in August of that same year (a year early).

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think Apple really needs to simplify the iPhone for the elderly. I know there are accessibility modes, but you don’t want to have to go through all that and spend hours trying to customize the phone. Also, the whole phone setup process needs to be delayed; having to go through it for an hour puts them off from even wanting to bother. I first set the phones up to make accounts, but it turns out none of them could understand how to unlock the phone. Entering a passcode was a nightmare because they kept forgetting it, even though it was a birthday they knew, lol. &lt;lb/&gt;So, I tried Touch ID and Face ID, and that was even more complicated and kept erroring out. Then, the Siri thing kept popping up on the phones with Touch ID, despite turning it off, and the whole swiping from the button kept making the screen go down to the bottom half. :/ There were too many apps; all they wanted was the phone app, but it doesn’t default to the keypad, which was too much for them to find.&lt;lb/&gt;The phones are too fiddly now, and pressing random things as they try to hold the phone meant the phone got lost in a sea of opening stuff up. So, I tried the assistive access, but why isn’t this an option from the get-go? It asks you the age of setup; why not have a 65+ or something for a senior mode?&lt;lb/&gt;They don’t need passcodes, accounts, and a sea of information. It’s insane, and it’s insane how fiddly these phones are. I never noticed because I’m used to it, but for these people with hands that barely move, the fake Touch ID button and the swiping from the bottom on Face ID phones seem to be the worst! I think having a proper physical button, like iPhones used to have, would have been superior. The one complaint about the fake button was that it didn’t feel like a real button, so they couldn’t gauge it.&lt;lb/&gt;I left there achieving nothing because they couldn’t figure out their old Nokia phones. The unlock thing on the keypad was too difficult, and if I turned that off, they kept dialing 999 in their pockets for some reason. That’s why I was there: they were calling emergency services 100 times a day, lol.&lt;lb/&gt;I think what I’ve realized is that I need to go back with flip phones that answer and hang up when you open and close them. However, the two I tried before didn’t act like that, and they had too many features. I really thought I could make the iPhone simple, but NOPE!&lt;lb/&gt;Apple should work on their phones to make them more accessible and less fiddly, without having to go through a sea of menus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I tried Touch ID and Face ID, and that was even more complicated and kept erroring out. Then, the Siri thing kept popping up on the phones with Touch ID, despite turning it off, and the whole swiping from the button kept making the screen go down to the bottom half. :/ There were too many apps; all they wanted was the phone app, but it doesn’t default to the keypad, which was too much for them to find.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phones are too fiddly now, and pressing random things as they try to hold the phone meant the phone got lost in a sea of opening stuff up. So, I tried the assistive access, but why isn’t this an option from the get-go? It asks you the age of setup; why not have a 65+ or something for a senior mode?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They don’t need passcodes, accounts, and a sea of information. It’s insane, and it’s insane how fiddly these phones are. I never noticed because I’m used to it, but for these people with hands that barely move, the fake Touch ID button and the swiping from the bottom on Face ID phones seem to be the worst! I think having a proper physical button, like iPhones used to have, would have been superior. The one complaint about the fake button was that it didn’t feel like a real button, so they couldn’t gauge it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I left there achieving nothing because they couldn’t figure out their old Nokia phones. The unlock thing on the keypad was too difficult, and if I turned that off, they kept dialing 999 in their pockets for some reason. That’s why I was there: they were calling emergency services 100 times a day, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think what I’ve realized is that I need to go back with flip phones that answer and hang up when you open and close them. However, the two I tried before didn’t act like that, and they had too many features. I really thought I could make the iPhone simple, but NOPE!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple should work on their phones to make them more accessible and less fiddly, without having to go through a sea of menus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FyneDesk is an easy to use Linux/Unix desktop environment following material design. It is built using the Fyne toolkit and is designed to be easy to use as well as easy to develop. We use the Go language and welcome any contributions or feedback for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compiling requires the same dependencies as Fyne. See the Getting Started documentation for installation steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a full desktop experience you will also need the following external tools installed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;arandr&lt;/code&gt;for modifying display settings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;xbacklight&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;brightnessctl&lt;/code&gt;for laptop brightness&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;connman-gtk&lt;/code&gt;is currently used for configuring Wi-Fi network settings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;compton&lt;/code&gt;for compositor support&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The desktop does work without the runtime dependencies but the experience will be degraded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using standard Go tools you can install FyneDesk using:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will add &lt;code&gt;fynedesk&lt;/code&gt; to your $GOPATH (usually ~/go/bin).
You can now run the app in "preview" mode like any other Fyne app.
Doing so is not running a window manager, to do so requires another few steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use this as your main desktop you can run the following commands to set up fynedesk as a selectable desktop option in your login manager (such as LightDM for example):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk
cd fynedesk
make
sudo make install
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now log out and see that it is in your desktop selection list at login.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also run the window manager components in an embedded X window for testing. You will need the &lt;code&gt;Xephyr&lt;/code&gt; tool installed for your platform (often installed as part of Xorg).
Once it is present you can use the following command from the same directory as above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make embed
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you run the command when there is a window manager running, or on an operating system that does not support window managers (Windows or macOS) then the app will start in UI test mode. When loaded in this way you can run all of the features except the controlling of windows - they will load on your main desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A desktop needs to be rock solid, and whilst we are working hard to get there, any alpha or beta software can run into unexpected issues. For that reason, we have included a &lt;code&gt;fynedesk_runner&lt;/code&gt; utility that can help
manage unexpected events. If you start the desktop using the runner, then
if a crash occurs, it will normally recover where it left off with no loss
of data in your applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using standard Go tools you can install the runner using:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk_runner
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From then on execute that instead of the &lt;code&gt;fynedesk&lt;/code&gt; command for a more
resilient desktop when testing out pre-release builds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design concepts, and the abstract wallpapers have been contributed by Jost Grant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are installing FyneDesk by default on a distribution, or making it available as a standard option, you should consider the following points. You do not need to ship the library or any dependencies, but it is recommended to add the following apps as well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;app&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;go get&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;fin&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;github.com/fyshos/fin&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A display manager app that matches the look and feel of FyneDesk&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please do let us know if you package FyneDesk for your system, so we can include a link from here :).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You Want Technology With Warts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I normally skip presentations because I prefer reading, but Building the Hundred-Year Web Service (YouTube) was worth the time.1 Note that despite “htmx” featuring in the title, very little of the presentation is actually about htmx. It is about choosing and using technology in such a way that it won’t require maintenance suddenly due to external factors changing. That’s a drum I’ve been banging for the last few years too, although less visibly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Petros observes that we know how to build bridges that last hundreds of years: stone, concrete, and steel can all do this with the right engineering. We also know how to build hypertext that is likely to last at least a few decades: use plain html and css. But, Petros asks, how do we create database-y web services that lasts for decades?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where do we store the data? Where do we perform business logic? He answers thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sqlite for data storage,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sql queries for most of the application logic,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Express-on-Node.js for routing and presentation logic,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jinja2 templates for additional presentation logic, and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;html and vanilla js for triggering http requests.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won’t debate the specifics here. 2 I’d be tempted to jam Perl into the backend instead of Node.js if I wanted truly low maintenance. I have a feeling a Perl script is more likely to run unmodified 20 years from now than some Node.js thing. But maybe I’m wrong on this. But there were other nuggets in the presentation. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I’ve frequently wondered why I turn to the web browser when I want to make cross-platform software. There’s a chart in the presentation that shows how environmental churn and api deprecation leads desktop applications to have an expected lifetime of maybe a decade, and phone apps closer to a couple of years. On the other hand, simple web pages have worked unmodified for over 40 years! That’s a good reason to default to the web as a technology.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a page load is fast enough, the browser does not do the whole flicker-a-blank-page-before-doing-a-full-repaint, it just shows the new content right away as a sort of partial update. This is apparently a recent browser innovation, but it is what allows e.g. Decision Drill to do a full page reload when a user interacts with it, and it still feels like one of them smooth xmlHttpRequest things. Rest assured, it’s a full page reload.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then the thing that triggered this article: sqlite. One of the more powerful arguments I’ve read against sqlite is that it has a few warts in its defaults, such tables being flexibly typed, foreign keys not being enforced, primary keys being nullable, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I’ve usually thought of these warts as a bad thing. Haskell has them too, like how the built in &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; type is bad data structure for storing text, and how
we’re stuck with a bunch of misnamed functions (mapM, ap, msum, etc.) because we
didn’t know better. Oh and the list of Perl’s warts is probably longer than its
implementation.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Petros reframes this problem. Every single wart that annoys us today, used to be a reasonable feature that someone relied on in their production code. Every wart we see today is a testament to the care the maintainers put into backward compatibility. If we choose a technology today, we want one that saves us from future maintenance by keeping our wartful code running – even if we don’t yet know it is wartful. The best indicator of this is whether the technology has warts today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I would much rather, the first time I install an application, “enable foreign keys” – it’s just one line of config – I’d rather do that once, build the thing correctly, and then be confident that if there’s any other built-in behaviour that I didn’t account for, that behaviour isn’t going to change on me and break my application at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Blender 4.5 brings big changes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;This article brought to you by LWN subscribers&lt;p&gt;Subscribers to LWN.net made this article — and everything that surrounds it — possible. If you appreciate our content, please buy a subscription and make the next set of articles possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blender 4.5 LTS was released on July 15, 2025, and will be supported through 2027. This is the last feature release of the 3D graphics-creation suite's 4.x series; it includes quality-of-life improvements, including work to bring the Vulkan backend up to par with the default OpenGL backend. With 4.5 released, Blender developers are turning their attention toward Blender 5.0, planned for release later this year. It will introduce substantial changes, particularly in the Geometry Nodes system, a central feature of Blender's procedural workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Brief introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blender is an open-source creative application released under the GPLv3. The Blender Foundation stewards development, with significant funding from the Blender Development Fund as well as backing from individual contributors and industry sponsors. Its code is primarily written in C and C++, with Python used extensively for scripting and add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Blender is often known as a 3D modeling and animation tool, it has grown into a comprehensive open-source suite for digital content creation. Alongside powerful 3D tools, it features compositing, nonlinear video editing, and 2D animation in 3D space. This integrated suite of tools enables designers, animators, and other creators to work with a single application across their digital pipeline. Blender also provides access to its core functions through Nodes, a visual programming system that enables procedural workflows for complex operations. The Grease Pencil tool, also accessible through the Geometry Nodes system, is used for 2D animation, cut-out animation, motion graphics, and more. Blender's procedural systems rely heavily on these node-based graphical interfaces, and the 4.5 LTS focuses on their continued evolution. These systems enable fully non-destructive workflows, preserving all original data at every stage of the editing process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blender strives to be compatible with visual-effects (VFX) industry standards through alignment with the VFX Reference Platform, which is updated annually. This allows Blender to be run on the same systems as other VFX software, as well as share files with them. 4.5 brings a slew of library updates to maintain alignment with the reference platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;A solid foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, Blender has relied on OpenGL for drawing its user interface and powering its 3D-display capabilities. However, efforts are underway to modernize this aspect of its core functionality by abstracting away the rendering backend, bringing support for running on additional graphics APIs, including Vulkan and Apple's Metal API. The Vulkan API is a low-overhead, cross-platform standard that allows applications like Blender to communicate more directly with GPU hardware than OpenGL. Being the final feature release of the 4.x series, this LTS brings a critical step in the maturity of the Vulkan backend. Though still not enabled by default due to multiple outstanding issues, it now rivals the OpenGL backend in both features and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan is built on a parallel-execution model, allowing applications to send multiple commands to the GPU simultaneously, while OpenGL relies on a sequential model. Vulkan's execution model makes better use of the increased number of cores found in modern GPUs. This is a crucial step toward smoother viewport performance and more responsive interaction with complex scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are known limitations still blocking the new backend from being adopted as the default. Notably, large meshes with 100-million vertices or more are not yet supported, resulting in poor performance on the Vulkan backend for virtual reality and other high-mesh-count applications. Future driver updates may address some of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The viewport in Blender is an interactive view space where 3D scenes are displayed and constructed. Rendering converts 3D scenes into 2D images or video, producing the final output with Blender's built-in engines or third-party renderers. Rendering can also be performed without the graphical interface by running Blender in headless mode, both on individual systems and at scale on render farms. The viewport and rendering upgrades in Blender 4.5 extend beyond the improvements to its Vulkan backend. Specifically, work continues on EEVEE, the realtime rendering engine built for rapid, interactive rendering on modern GPUs. EEVEE 2.0, also known as EEVEE Next, receives several critical improvements focused on stability and visual accuracy. Shadows now render more smoothly thanks to the addition of shadow terminator normal bias. This is an area where EEVEE has struggled to match other renderers, including Blender's own Cycles rendering engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two settings control shadow termination bias: "Geometry Offset" and "Shading Offset", found in the "Shading" tab of the "Object Properties" panel. This gives artists greater control over the position and angle of shadows. However, due to the difficulties of creating shadows that work equally well for all projects, the default for these settings is "no bias". These visual improvements coincide with fixes for rendering problems such as light leaking from large light sources. Light leaking is a phenomenon where light incorrectly passes through or around solid objects, creating unrealistic bright spots in the rendered scene. Overall, these changes aim to bring EEVEE Next closer to parity with other renderers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond rendering quality, this LTS release delivers improvements to workflow fluidity. Texture loading, shader compilation, and startup times all contribute to overall performance and user experience, and all three have been improved. Textures are now loaded using a deferred, multithreaded process, resulting in more than double the speed of the previous method. This change introduces a small CPU overhead due to loading textures before redrawing the viewport, but the cost is not significant enough to severely impact performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shaders are also now compiled in parallel. Crucially, this optimization is independent of the viewport backend in use, whether Vulkan or OpenGL, translating to immediate benefits from these core improvements. That said, a new preference allows users to revert to sub-process shader calculation, if desired, which is faster but consumes more RAM. Additionally, by skipping unnecessary shading steps during viewport initialization, startup times have been improved significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With ongoing efforts to improve the workspace, users can now control which tabs are visible in the Properties Editor through the right-click pop-up menu. The Asset Browser, used for importing and organizing assets (including scenes, 3D objects, textures, and more), has been continually refined throughout the 4.x series. In 4.5 LTS, it receives some key usability enhancements, particularly in how assets are displayed, such as wrapping long lines used for asset labels, and making it easier to create thumbnails for assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Nodes, Grease Pencil, and modeling polish&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than focusing solely on fixes and performance gains, this cycle emphasized tighter integration between the various node systems in Blender. The result is that Shader Nodes, Compositor Nodes, and Geometry Nodes (including Grease Pencil Nodes) now share more capabilities and have a more consistent workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common nodes (including mathematical operations) and procedural textures available with Shader Nodes and Geometry Nodes are now available for use in the Compositor. This change enables effects such as procedurally generated visual noise or cloudiness applied to an image or video during post-processing. Common nodes can be copied across Shader and Geometry Node setups, further aligning node logic and capability design across the toolset. In Geometry Nodes, the new "Set Mesh Normal" node grants artists direct control over custom normals, which are perpendicular vectors that are used to represent the orientation of a surface. By allowing users to define normals via Fields, Blender provides fine-grained procedural controls for surface shading. For instance, an animator could drive this node with a value to simulate a material seamlessly transitioning from a soft, smooth surface to a rough, hard-edged one, all without the need for manually editing the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 4.5, Point Clouds debut as a new object type, accessible from the "Add" menu in the viewport or through various Geometry Nodes. Point Clouds represent objects as a group of points in 3D space and have long been used in scientific and industrial 3D scanning. According to the Blender developer documentation on Point Clouds, this new object type supports motion graphics, physics simulations (including particle systems), granular materials (such as sand and gravel), and 3D scanning. To this end, Blender includes comprehensive tools and editable object attributes, including standard transformations like rotation and scale. It also maintains high rendering performance through EEVEE and Cycles, putting point clouds on par with meshes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With 4.5 LTS out the door, the Blender developers have shifted focus to 5.0, the next major release, which is now under active development. As the beginning of a new, feature-breaking series, 5.0 introduces significant refinements and modernized workflows without abandoning the user interface paradigm established by Blender 2.80 in 2019. The release notes outline several key features planned for the release. Among these improvements is the ability to mark scenes as assets, allowing entire scenes with their contents and setup to be pulled directly into the visual scene editor using the asset browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Grease Pencil tool in 5.0 supports the motion blur effect, controlled by the new "Motion Blur Steps" setting in the "Grease Pencil" render panel. Linux users now benefit from HDR support in the viewport on Wayland when using the Vulkan backend. Additionally, a change to the .blend file format to handle larger content allows Blender to store meshes with more than a few hundred million vertices. This feature required a change to the file structure of the .blend file format, meaning that files created in version 5.0 are incompatible with Blender 4.4 and prior releases, but can be loaded in 4.5 LTS. While the new format supports meshes with hundreds of millions of vertices, working with such files still demands powerful hardware, specifically large amounts of system RAM and GPU memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blender 5.0 improves symmetry in Edit Mode by ensuring mirrored operations no longer fail or produce inconsistent results. UV mapping, the process of unfolding the surface of a 3D model onto a 2D image for applying textures, sees improvements in Blender 5.0 thanks to improved synchronization. This change ensures selections remain aligned between the viewport and the UV Editor. Blender 5.0 finally resolves this longstanding limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those interested in downloading Blender 4.5 can get official builds from the project web site, install the Flatpak via Flathub, or install the snap package from the Snap Store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DOGWALK, a game by the Blender Foundation, which was built using Blender and the Godot engine, was released at the same time as 4.5. The game is freely available for download from Blender Studio, Steam, and Itch.io.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the release schedule, Blender 5.0 will enter beta on October 1, 2025. Interested users can access official daily builds from Blender's experimental downloads page. Blender's development is open to contributors of all backgrounds; instructions on contributing code, documentation, and more are available in the developer portal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rewrite the attention kernel to be persistent. This gives better performance at low-contexts. However, fp16 at large context has suffered a bit due to a ptxas instruction scheduling issue in the softmax partition. fp8 is ~100 tflops faster when the kernel name has "cutlass" in it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The convert layout coming out of the &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; is no longer needed, but&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ValueError('Layout mismatch in broadcast: 

SliceLayout(dim=1, parent=BlockedLayout(size_per_thread=[1, 128], threads_per_warp=[32, 1], warps_per_cta=[4, 1], order=[0, 1], ctas_per_cga=[1, 1], cta_split_num=[1, 1], cta_order=[1, 0])) 
vs 
SliceLayout(dim=1, parent=DistributedLinearLayout(reg_bases=[[0, 64], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 4], [0, 8], [0, 16], [0, 32]], lane_bases=[[1, 0], [2, 0], [4, 0], [8, 0], [16, 0]], warp_bases=[[32, 0], [64, 0]], block_bases=[], shape=[128, 128]))')
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; ends up with a linear layout instead of a blocked layout. I am not sure why though -- I believe the layout inference should try a blocked layout first before falling back to linear layout.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By disassembly of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ptxas&lt;/code&gt;, it is indeed hard-coded that they have logic like&lt;code&gt;strstr(kernel_name, "cutlass")&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's Interesting! I'm curious is it feasible to modifty asm code for &lt;code&gt;ptxas&lt;/code&gt; that make the &lt;code&gt;al&lt;/code&gt; return register always be true (maybe we could modify code in the address between &lt;code&gt;2165-216c&lt;/code&gt;), did you have a try?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Admittedly it is feasible. But it is more likely that, this is an unstable, experimental, aggressive optimization by NVIDIA, and blindly always enabling it may produce some elusive bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;For D64 it did drop quite a bit during the transition to persistent. This is due to a scheduling issue in ptxas that I couldn't find a workaround for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way we consume content on the internet is increasingly driven by walled-garden platforms and black-box feed algorithms. This shift is making our media diets miserable. Ironically, a solution to the problem predates algorithmic feeds, social media and other forms of informational junk food. It is called RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and it is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the hell is RSS?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RSS is just a format that defines how websites can publish updates (articles, posts, episodes, and so on) in a standard feed that you can subscribe to using an RSS reader (or aggregator). Don’t worry if this sounds extremely uninteresting to you; there aren’t many people that get excited about format specifications; the beauty of RSS is in its simplicity. Any content management system or blog platform supports RSS out of the box, and often enables it by default. As a result, a large portion of the content on the internet is available to you in feeds that you can tap into. But this time, you’re in full control of what you’re receiving, and the feeds are purely reverse chronological bliss. Coincidentally, you might already be using RSS without even knowing, because the whole podcasting world runs on RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many amazing articles about the utility and elegance of RSS, and I do not think the world needs another, so I will spare you and instead focus on my personal experience and tips. If you are interested in a deeper dive, I highly recommend Molly White’s article Curate your own newspaper with RSS. It is a convincing, well-written article that you can also listen to in Molly’s own voice if you wish to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Broken distribution models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a little story about the promise of social media. In 2011, my band was getting a little more serious and preparing to record our first album. Facebook was rapidly growing all over the world, so I created an account - mostly to manage my band’s Facebook page. Back then, social media (and Facebook in particular) felt very different: vibrant and full of promise for the brave new future of web 2.0. I looked up all my favorite bands so that every time they put out an album or tour near me, I wouldn’t miss it. Many bands either lacked proper websites or rarely updated them in a useful way, so this felt like the perfect use case for Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for me to start seeing the cracks. As Facebook would push for more engagement, some bands would flood their pages with multiple posts per day, especially if they were touring or had a new release coming up. Others would be more restrained, but then their posts would often be lost in the feed. There was no way to opt in only for a certain type of updates from my followed pages, and the increasingly algorithmic feed would simply prioritize posts by engagement. I realized that I wouldn’t be able to get just the important updates; instead, I’d get a wild mish-mash of engagement-bait that I wasn’t willing to work my way through. And don’t get me started about how over time, page owners had to pay to promote their posts to get any reach on the platform - that is simply extortion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I no longer use Facebook (or any similar social media for that matter) for many reasons, though algorithmic feeds are at the top of the list. Algorithms on social media are very unlikely to be written with your best interest in mind: The goal of social media is to keep you glued to the feed for as long as possible. It optimizes for the most time spent, for engagement, for serving the most ads. It will not necessarily optimize for keeping you well informed, showing you balanced opinions, giving you control or even showing you all the information you’d like. The misalignment of incentives has become very apparent in the last few years, but the problem goes deeper. Any type of curation (because algorithmic feeds are simply curation machines) will never be flexible enough to account for every person’s needs. The story we are sold with algorithmic curation is that it adapts to everyone’s taste and interests, but that’s only true until the interests of the advertisers enter the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How I use RSS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My RSS journey starting many moons ago with Opera and Thunderbird, continued with Google Reader (RIP) and The Old Reader, and finally led me to running my own instance of FreshRSS. However, in the last year, I have read most of the content from my RSS feeds on my phone via the FeedMe app. I find that it scratches the itch of unlocking your phone and wanting to see something novel (probably gravitating towards social media). On the upside, it feeds me only articles and media that a) I have picked upfront and nothing more, b) is typically longer-form and more thoughtful than your typical social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, unlike algorithmic feeds, it allows me to pick what category of my interests I am in the mood for. If I’m in the mood for something lighter, I can just look into my “Fun” folder to check out new stuff from The Oatmeal or xkcd. If I feel like reading something more thoughtful, I’d dive into my “Reads” folder for The Marginalian or Sentiers. Feeling like catching up on the newest AI research? I can browse the latest research papers from arXiv that have specific keywords in the abstracts (such as prompt injection). Or I could just browse everything at once to see what piques my interest. I am the master of what information I consume, how and in what order, and no one can take that away from me by rearranging my feed or tweaking the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the many small advantages is the consistency of the interface and the lack of distractions when reading. Modern browsers support reader modes, but you need to enter the mode manually and some pages might not be displayed correctly. I don’t have any attention problems (that I know of), but reading articles on certain newspaper sites feels like a cruel joke: the text of the article is often drowned by ads, suggested articles, polls, and other visual smog. Not a pleasant reading experience. Your RSS reader always uses the same font, font size, screen real estate and never shows anything but the article itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The focused, reductive nature of RSS readers means you don’t get the full website experience, but that is arguably for the better in a lot of cases. We already mentioned the lack of suggested articles with engagement bait that could easily draw you in, but another notable omission is the comments section. It is very easy to slip into the comments section at the bottom of an article and spend far too much time reading those. You can still do that in an RSS reader by opening the article in your browser, scrolling down to the comments and diving in. At least in my case, that is a safe amount of friction to prevent me from doing it most of the time. Less is more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tips to get you going&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many of the websites you open regularly, follow on social media or get a newsletter from, likely have an RSS feed. Look out for the RSS icon or the words RSS or feed. There are also tools like Lighthouse that can sniff out the feed for you. That said, my experience is that simply adding the homepage URL of the website into an aggregator usually works.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remember my frustration with Facebook as a source of news for new music releases? Turns out there is a much better free solution called Muspy, where you enter all your favorite artists and it will notify you of their new releases. And guess what? You either get notified via email, or you use your personal RSS feed. Highly recommended!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start easy with something like The Old Reader or Feedly - both offer relatively generous free tiers. And if you outgrow them or want to try something else, you simply export an OPML file with all your feeds and import them into your new RSS solution. This is the upside of open standards: freedom, ownership, and portability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once you have more than 5-10 feeds, start putting them into folders/categories. No need to overthink it, but doing this will help you be more selective about the content you read if you’re in a specific mood.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RSS readers can be great when traveling or whenever your internet connection might be down or spotty. You can set up your RSS client in a way that automatically fetches new content, so when you board the plane and go dark, you can still read through the already downloaded articles. (Beware, though: not all RSS feeds include full content - sometimes they’re more like teasers.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some websites that limit how many articles you can browse for free are actually less strict about content accessed through RSS feeds. There are obvious ethical concerns with abusing this, but it is still an upside, and you are only consuming what they provide.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you want to tinker, you can set up an RSS aggregator like FreshRSS, tiny tiny RSS or selfoss on a shared web hosting service. If you want to go full self-hosted, there are many more options available.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get a good mobile app. Try a few before you settle! This is a highly personal choice because even small UI quirks and differences may bother you. If you’re anything like me, you’ll do most of the reading on your phone, so make sure it feels good.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RSS readers/clients often have bookmarking/starring system which works much like dedicated bookmarking apps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bigger publications often have separate feeds for individual categories or tags - check those to avoid getting your main feed flooded.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some websites have very elaborate RSS APIs which allow you to query for specific types of content. For example, arXiv has a really elaborate one, allowing you to only follow specific topics. The documentation is quite complex, so here is a quick example to kick start you:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=abs:LLM+AND+multilingual&amp;amp;sortBy=submittedDate&amp;amp;sortOrder=descending&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The query searches through the most recently submitted papers with the words LLM and multilingual in the abstract.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do a little cleanup from time to time: unsubscribe from feeds that no longer seem to interest you. It’s fine, no one will take offense, and your attention is too precious to be wasted on stuff that is not for you.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t know where to start? Check out this list of 100 most popular RSS feeds, Feedspot’s 70 most popular feeds or Hostinger’s list of 55 popular blogs. Apart from that, Google is your friend (especially if you start searching for specific topics or niches), and good blogs often link to other blogs - all you need to do is to follow the breadcrumbs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy RSS-ing!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting Started | Configuration | Setup Showcase&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right. Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every monitor has its own separate window strip. Windows can never "overflow" onto an adjacent monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically. Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there's always one empty workspace present all the way down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense. When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dynamic workspaces like in GNOME&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An Overview that zooms out workspaces and windows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built-in screenshot UI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can block out sensitive windows from screencasts&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Dynamic cast target that can change what it shows on the go&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Touchpad and mouse gestures&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Group windows into tabs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gradient borders with Oklab and Oklch support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Animations with support for custom shaders&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Live-reloading config&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works with screen readers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;demo.mp4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also check out this video from Brodie Robertson that showcases a lot of the niri functionality: Niri Is My New Favorite Wayland Compositor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor. Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our Matrix channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give it a try! Follow the instructions on the Getting Started page. Have your waybars and fuzzels ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment. Also check out awesome-niri, a list of niri-related links and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some points you may have questions about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-monitor: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fractional scaling: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NVIDIA: seems to work fine.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Floating windows: yes, starting from niri 25.01.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Input devices: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens. You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use OpenTabletDriver. We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wlr protocols: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy. You can check on wayland.app at the bottom of each protocol's page.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance. I've seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Xwayland: integrated via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A tour of the niri scrolling-tiling Wayland compositor · July 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An LWN article with a nice overview and introduction to niri.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you'd like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so. See CONTRIBUTING.md for an overview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Niri is heavily inspired by PaperWM which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors. Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell's global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PaperWM: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;karousel: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;scroll and papersway: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hyprscrolling and hyprslidr: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PaperWM.spoon: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Move Over Dijkstra: The New Algorithm That Just Rewrote 70 Years of Computer Science&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For nearly seven decades, Dijkstra’s algorithm has reigned supreme as the gold standard for finding shortest paths in graphs. Born from a 20-minute mental exercise at an Amsterdam café in 1956, Edsger Dijkstra’s creation has been the backbone of everything from GPS navigation to network routing protocols. But that reign just ended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A research team led by Ran Duan at Tsinghua University has achieved what many considered impossible: they’ve broken the fundamental “sorting barrier” that has limited shortest-path algorithms for 40 years. Their new deterministic O(m log^(2/3) n)-time algorithm for single-source shortest paths represents a breakthrough that challenges textbook assumptions about algorithmic limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Foundation That Held for 70 Years&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dijkstra’s algorithm works by maintaining a sorted priority queue of vertices, always selecting the closest unvisited vertex next. This greedy approach guarantees optimality because it processes vertices in order of their distance from the source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def dijkstra(graph, source):&lt;lb/&gt;    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}&lt;lb/&gt;    distances[source] = 0&lt;lb/&gt;    priority_queue = [(0, source)]&lt;lb/&gt;    visited = set()&lt;lb/&gt;    &lt;lb/&gt;    while priority_queue…&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Thermometer for Measuring Quantumness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there’s one law of physics that seems easy to grasp, it’s the second law of thermodynamics: Heat flows spontaneously from hotter bodies to colder ones. But now, gently and almost casually, Alexssandre de Oliveira Jr. has just shown me I didn’t truly understand it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take this hot cup of coffee and this cold jug of milk, the Brazilian physicist said as we sat in a café in Copenhagen. Bring them into contact and, sure enough, heat will flow from the hot object to the cold one, just as the German scientist Rudolf Clausius first stated formally in 1850. However, in some cases, de Oliveira explained, physicists have learned that the laws of quantum mechanics can drive heat flow the opposite way: from cold to hot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t really mean that the second law fails, he added as his coffee reassuringly cooled. It’s just that Clausius’ expression is the “classical limit” of a more complete formulation demanded by quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Physicists began to appreciate the subtlety of this situation more than two decades ago and have been exploring the quantum mechanical version of the second law ever since. Now, de Oliveira, a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Denmark, and colleagues have shown that the kind of “anomalous heat flow” that’s enabled at the quantum scale could have a convenient and ingenious use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can serve, they say, as an easy method for detecting “quantumness” — sensing, for instance, that an object is in a quantum “superposition” of multiple possible observable states, or that two such objects are entangled, with states that are interdependent — without destroying those delicate quantum phenomena. Such a diagnostic tool could be used to ensure that a quantum computer is truly using quantum resources to perform calculations. It might even help to sense quantum aspects of the force of gravity, one of the stretch goals of modern physics. All that’s needed, the researchers say, is to connect a quantum system to a second system that can store information about it, and to a heat sink: a body that’s able to absorb a lot of energy. With this setup, you can boost the transfer of heat to the heat sink, exceeding what would be permitted classically. Simply by measuring how hot the sink is, you could then detect the presence of superposition or entanglement in the quantum system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practical benefits aside, the research demonstrates a new aspect of a deep truth about thermodynamics: How heat and energy can be transformed and moved in physical systems is intimately bound up with information — what is or can be known about those systems. In this case, we “pay for” the anomalous heat flow by sacrificing stored information about the quantum system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I love the idea that thermodynamic quantities can signal quantum phenomena,” said the physicist Nicole Yunger Halpern of the University of Maryland. “The topic is fundamental and deep.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Knowledge Is Power&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The connection between the second law of thermodynamics and information was first explored in the 19th century by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell. To Maxwell’s distress, Clausius’ second law seemed to imply that pockets of heat will dissipate throughout the universe until all temperature differences disappear. In the process, the total entropy of the universe — crudely, a measure of how disordered and featureless it is — will inexorably increase. Maxwell realized that this trend would eventually remove all possibility of harnessing heat flows to do useful work, and the universe would settle into a sterile equilibrium pervaded by a uniform buzz of thermal motion: a “heat death.” That forecast would be troubling enough to anyone. It was anathema to the devoutly Christian Maxwell. But in a letter to his friend Peter Guthrie Tait in 1867, Maxwell claimed to have found a way to “pick a hole” in the second law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He imagined a tiny being (later dubbed a demon) who could see the motions of individual molecules in a gas. The gas would fill a box that was divided in two by a wall with a trapdoor. By opening and closing the trapdoor selectively, the demon could sequester the faster-moving molecules in one compartment and the slower-moving ones in the other, making a hot gas and a cold one, respectively. By acting on the information it gathered about molecules’ motions, the demon thus reduced the entropy of the gas, creating a temperature gradient that could be used to do mechanical work, such as pushing a piston.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists felt sure that Maxwell’s demon couldn’t really violate the second law, but it took nearly 100 years to figure out why not. The answer is that the information the demon collects and stores about the molecular motions will eventually fill up its finite memory. Its memory must then be erased and reset for it to keep working. The physicist Rolf Landauer showed in 1961 that this erasure burns energy and produces entropy — more entropy than is reduced by the demon’s sorting actions. Landauer’s analysis established an equivalence between information and entropy, implying that information itself can act as a thermodynamic resource: It can be transformed into work. Physicists experimentally demonstrated this information-to-energy conversion in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But quantum phenomena allow information to be processed in ways that classical physics does not permit — that’s the entire basis of technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography. And that’s why quantum theory messes with the conventional second law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Exploiting Correlations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entangled quantum objects have mutual information: They are correlated, so we can discover properties of one by looking at the other. That in itself is not so strange; if you look at one of a pair of gloves and find it’s left-handed, you know the other is right-handed. But a pair of entangled quantum particles differs from gloves in a particular way: Whereas the handedness of gloves is already fixed before you look, this isn’t the case for the particles, according to quantum mechanics. Before we measure them, it’s undecided which value of the observable property each particle in the entangled pair has. At that stage the only things we can know are the probabilities of the possible combinations of values, such as 50% left-right and 50% right-left. Only when we measure the state of one of the particles do these possibilities resolve themselves into a definite outcome. In that measurement process, the entanglement is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If gas molecules are entangled in this way, then a Maxwell’s demon can manipulate them more efficiently than if all the molecules are moving independently. If, say, the demon knows that any fast-moving molecule it sees coming is correlated in such a way that it will be trailed by another fast one just a moment later, the demon doesn’t have to bother observing the second particle before opening the trapdoor to admit it. The thermodynamic cost of (temporarily) foiling the second law is lowered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2004, the quantum theorists Časlav Brukner of the University of Vienna and Vlatko Vedral, then at Imperial College London, pointed out that this means macroscopic thermodynamic measurements can be used as a “witness” to reveal the presence of quantum entanglement between particles. Under certain conditions, they showed, a system’s heat capacity or its response to an applied magnetic field should carry an imprint of entanglement, if it is present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, other physicists calculated that you can extract more work from a warm body when there is quantum entanglement in the system than when it is purely classical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in 2008, the physicist Hossein Partovi of California State University identified a particularly dramatic implication of the way quantum entanglement can undermine preconceptions derived from classical thermodynamics. He realized that the presence of entanglement can actually reverse the spontaneous flow of heat from a hot object to a cold one, seemingly upending the second law itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That reversal is a special kind of refrigeration, Halpern said. And as usual with refrigeration, it doesn’t come for free (and so doesn’t truly subvert the second law). Classically, refrigerating an object takes work: We have to pump the heat the “wrong” way by consuming fuel, thereby repaying the entropy that’s lost by making the cold object colder and the hot object hotter. But in the quantum case, Halpern said, instead of burning fuel to achieve refrigeration, “you burn the correlations.” In other words, as the anomalous heat flow proceeds, the entanglement gets destroyed: Particles that initially had correlated properties become independent. “We can use the correlations as a resource to push heat in the opposite direction,” Halpern said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In effect, the fuel here is information itself: specifically the mutual information of the entangled hot and cold bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years later, David Jennings and Terry Rudolph of Imperial College London clarified what’s going on. They showed how the second law of thermodynamics can be reformulated to include the case where mutual information is present, and they calculated the limits on how much the classical heat flow can be altered and even reversed by the consumption of quantum correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Demon Knows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When quantum effects are in play, then, the second law isn’t so simple. But can we do anything useful with the way quantum physics loosens the bounds of thermodynamic laws? That’s one of the goals of the discipline called quantum thermodynamics, in which some researchers seek to make quantum engines that run more efficiently than classical ones, or quantum batteries that charge more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patryk Lipka-Bartosik of the Center for Theoretical Physics at the Polish Academy of Sciences has sought practical applications in the other direction: using thermodynamics as a tool for probing quantum physics. Last year, he and his co-workers saw how to realize Brukner and Vedral’s 2004 idea to use thermodynamic properties as a witness of quantum entanglement. Their scheme involves hot and cold quantum systems that are correlated with each other, and a third system to mediate the heat flow between the two. We can think of this third system as a Maxwell’s demon, except now it has a “quantum memory” that can itself be entangled with the systems it is manipulating. Being entangled with the demon’s memory effectively links the hot and cold systems so that the demon can infer something about one from the properties of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such a quantum demon can act as a kind of catalyst, helping heat transfer happen by accessing correlations that are inaccessible otherwise. That is, because it is entangled with the hot and cold objects, the demon can divine and exploit all their correlations systematically. And, again like a catalyst, this third system returns to its original state once the heat exchange between the objects is completed. In this way, the process can boost the anomalous heat flow beyond what can be achieved without such a catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paper this year by de Oliveira, co-authored by Lipka-Bartosik and Jonatan Bohr Brask of the Technical University of Denmark, uses some of these same ideas but with a crucial difference that turns the setup into a kind of thermometer for measuring quantumness. In the earlier work, the demonlike quantum memory interacted with a correlated pair of quantum systems, one hot and one cold. But in the latest work, it sits between a quantum system (say, an array of entangled quantum bits, or qubits, in a quantum computer) and a simple heat sink with which the quantum system is not directly entangled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the memory is entangled with both the quantum system and the sink, it can again catalyze heat flow between them beyond what is possible classically. In that process, entanglement within the quantum system converts into extra heat that enters the sink. So measuring the energy stored in the heat sink (akin to reading its “temperature”) reveals the presence of entanglement in the quantum system. But since the system and sink aren’t themselves entangled, the measurement doesn’t affect the state of the quantum system. This gambit circumvents the notorious way that measurements destroy quantumness. “If you simply tried to make a measurement on the [quantum] system directly, you’d destroy its entanglement before the process could even unfold,” de Oliveira said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new scheme has the advantage of being simple and general, said Vedral, who is now at the University of Oxford. “These verification protocols are very important,” he said: Whenever some quantum computer company makes a new announcement about the performance of its latest device, he said the question always arises of how (or if) they really know that entanglement among the qubits is helping with the computation. A heat sink could serve as a detector of such quantum phenomena purely via its energy change. To implement the idea, you might designate one quantum bit as the memory whose state reveals that of other qubits, and then couple this memory qubit to a set of particles that will serve as the sink, whose energy you can measure. (One proviso, Vedral added, is that you need to have very good control over your system to be sure there aren’t other sources of heat flow contaminating the measurements. Another is that the method will not detect all entangled states.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;De Oliveira thinks that a system already exists for testing their idea experimentally. He and his colleagues are discussing that goal with Roberto Serra’s research group at the Federal University of ABC in São Paulo, Brazil. In 2016, Serra and colleagues used the magnetic orientations, or spins, of carbon and hydrogen atoms in molecules of chloroform as quantum bits between which they could transfer heat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using this setup, de Oliveira says it should be possible to exploit a quantum behavior — in this case coherence, meaning that the properties of two or more spins are evolving in phase with one another — to change the heat flow between the atoms. Coherence of qubits is essential for quantum computing, so being able to verify it by detecting anomalous heat exchange could be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stakes could be even higher. Several research groups are trying to design experiments to determine whether gravity is a quantum force like the other three fundamental forces. Some of these efforts involve looking for quantum entanglement between two objects generated purely by their mutual gravitational attraction. Perhaps researchers could probe such gravity-induced entanglement by making simple thermodynamic measurements on them — thereby verifying (or not) that gravity really is quantized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To study one of the deepest questions in physics, Vedral said, “wouldn’t it be lovely if you could do something as easy and macroscopic as this?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;TikTok has directed children’s accounts to pornographic content within a small number of clicks, according to a report by a campaign group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global Witness set up fake accounts using a 13-year-old’s birth date and turned on the video app’s “restricted mode”, which limits exposure to “sexually suggestive” content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers found TikTok suggested sexualised and explicit search terms to seven test accounts that were created on clean phones with no search history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The terms suggested under the “you may like” feature included “very very rude skimpy outfits” and “very rude babes” – and then escalated to terms such as “hardcore pawn [sic] clips”. For three of the accounts the sexualised searches were suggested immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a “small number of clicks” the researchers encountered pornographic content ranging from women flashing to penetrative sex. Global Witness said the content attempted to evade moderation, usually by showing the clip within an innocuous picture or video. For one account the process took two clicks after logging on: one click on the search bar and then one on the suggested search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global Witness, a climate organisation whose remit includes investigating big tech’s impact on human rights, said it conducted two batches of tests, with one set before the implementation of child protection rules under the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA) on 25 July and another after.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It added that two videos featured someone who appeared to be under 16 years old and had been sent to the Internet Watch Foundation, which monitors online child sexual abuse material.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global Witness claimed TikTok was in breach of the OSA, which requires tech companies to prevent children from encountering harmful content such as pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Ofcom, the UK communications regulator charged with overseeing the act, said: “We appreciate the work behind this research and will review its findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ofcom’s codes for adhering to the act state that tech companies that pose a medium or high risk of showing harmful content must “configure their algorithms to filter out harmful content from children’s feeds”. TikTok’s content guidelines ban pornographic content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TikTok said after being contacted by Global Witness it had removed the offending videos and made changes to its search recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As soon as we were made aware of these claims, we took immediate action to investigate them, remove content that violated our policies, and launch improvements to our search suggestion feature,” said a spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
