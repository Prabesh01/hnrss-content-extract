      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About Artie&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Artie is a real-time streaming platform that moves production data across systems in real-time, with zero maintenance. We make high-volume data replication simple, reliable, and scalable for engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our platform powers mission-critical use cases including fraud and risk monitoring, inventory visibility, customer-facing analytics, and AI workloads. Artie is built for engineers who care about performance, reliability, and operational simplicity — and we’re growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re trusted by teams like ClickUp, Substack, and Alloy, and backed by top-tier investors including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, Pathlight Ventures, and the founders of Dropbox and Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring our first in-house recruiter to own and build talent at Artie. This role is your chance to build our team from first principles.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About the Role&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is not a coordination role and not a “run the ATS” job.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You will be responsible for end-to-end recruiting across the company, with a focus on Engineering, Product, Operations, and Design (EPOD). You’ll partner directly with founders and hiring managers, define what “great” looks like for each role, and build the recruiting foundation we scale on top of.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You will also be the internal owner for our external recruiting partners — setting strategy, calibrating quality, and ensuring agencies complement our in-house motion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you view recruiting as a mix of sales, systems thinking, storytelling, and judgment, this role is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a high-trust, high-ownership role, and you’ll have real influence over the shape, culture, and trajectory of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Own full-cycle recruiting across the company&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

        &lt;item&gt;Run outbound recruiting with creativity and rigor — LinkedIn, referrals, networks, events, cold outreach, and non-obvious channels&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Confidently engage technical candidates and speak credibly about: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Engineering culture and technical challenges&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Artie’s product, architecture, and roadmap (with support from founders)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sell Artie to candidates&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Craft and deliver a compelling narrative around: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Why Artie exists&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Why this team is special&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Why this is a rare career opportunity&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Own candidate experience end-to-end - build a world-class recruiting process that delights candidates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Build recruiting infrastructure from scratch&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Own and evolve our recruiting process, tools, and operating rhythm&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Manage and improve our ATS and sourcing tools&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Track and report on hiring progress, pipeline health, and bottlenecks&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Continuously improve speed, quality, and candidate experience as we scale&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Manage external recruiting partners&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Act as the primary point of contact for agencies we work with&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Set expectations, role briefs, and quality bars&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Ensure agencies augment our hiring motion rather than define it&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;item&gt;Able to build credibility quickly with senior technical candidates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sales mindset&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You view recruiting as a sales and persuasion problem&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Comfortable with outbound, rejection, and ambiguity&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Strong written and verbal communicator&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Extreme ownership&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Open Coding Agents: Fast, accessible coding agents that adapt to any repo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;January 27, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ai2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, coding agents have transformed how developers write, test, and maintain software. These systems can debug, refactor, and even submit pull requests—fundamentally changing what software development looks like. Yet despite this progress, most coding agents share the same constraints: they're closed, expensive to train, and difficult to study or adapt to private codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ai2 Open Coding Agents change that. Today we’re releasing not just a collection of strong open coding models, but a training method that makes building your own coding agent for any codebase – for example, your personal codebase or an internal codebase at your organization – remarkably accessible for tasks including code generation, code review, debugging, maintenance, and code explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closed models haven't seen your internal code, so they don't know it—custom data pipelines, internal APIs, specific org conventions, and so on. Training on your private data teaches them, but generating synthetic training data from private codebases that works for agents has been challenging and cost-prohibitive. Our method makes it easy—reproducing the performance of the previously best open-source model costs ~$400 of compute, or up to $12,000 for performance that rivals the best industry models of the same size. This puts the full recipe within reach for labs and small teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resource constraints drove us to maximize efficiency at every stage, from data quality to inference costs to model selection. The result: we match SWE-smith, a synthetic data method, at 57× lower cost and SkyRL, an open-source reinforcement learning (RL) system, at 26× lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first release in our Open Coding Agents family is SERA (Soft-verified Efficient Repository Agents). The strongest – SERA-32B – solves 54.2% of SWE-Bench Verified problems, surpassing prior open-source state-of-the-art coding models of comparable sizes and context lengths while requiring only 40 GPU days (or fewer) to train on a cluster of 2 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs or NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs. SERA models are optimized and compatible with Claude Code out of the box. With our fine-tuning method, you can specialize them to your own codebase including your full engineering stack and conventions quickly and at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We collaborated with NVIDIA to optimize SERA inference for their accelerated infrastructure, ensuring researchers and developers can get the most out of these models in production environments. Early benchmarks are promising: running in BF16 precision on 4xH100 GPUs, SERA achieves approximately 1,950 peak output tokens per second with a 16k context window. At FP8 precision, SERA reaches 3,700 peak output tokens per second—a higher throughput at almost negligible accuracy drop. On next-generation Blackwell 4xB200 systems running in NVFP4, SERA scales further to around 8,600 peak output tokens per second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every component of this release is open – models, Claude Code integration, and training recipes – and can be launched with a single line of code, making it easy to use even for those without LLM training experience. We're also releasing state-of-the-art training data so researchers can inspect what worked and push it further, and conduct deep science while avoiding the many stumbling blocks, dead ends, and other roadblocks typical of coding agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One result we're especially excited about: SERA uniquely enables adapting to private datasets like internal codebases, and we see evidence that a smaller, open model can replicate and possibly even exceed the performance of a more capable "teacher" coding agent in these setups. For example, SERA-32B can surpass its 110B parameter teacher (GLM-4.5-Air) on codebases like Django and Sympy after training on just 8,000 samples at a cost of $1,300.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accessible open models can now inherit strong agentic behavior through a simple, reproducible pipeline—no large-scale RL infrastructure or engineering team required. Case in point, SERA was built largely by a single Ai2 researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The challenge: specializing agents to your data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a small to mid-sized business or independent developer, you probably have code that works with customer data in ways no public model has ever seen. Training on that data would help, but generating agent-ready synthetic data from private codebases has been the hard part. The holy grail would be a method that yields state-of-the-art training data for any codebase, with minimal setup and clear evidence that the tuned model is actually learning agentic behavior versus fragile heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tackle this challenge with our new post-training approach that achieves state-of-the-art open-source results on SWE-Bench at a fraction of the typical training costs. Two innovations make it both inexpensive and effective:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Soft-verified generation (SVG). Synthetic training data generation, which is key to training a strong coding agent, is usually done by generating pairs of code examples that have both incorrect and corrected code. From these examples, the coding agent can learn how to transform incorrect code into correct code by generating a patch with line-by-line code changes. Usually, these examples need to be carefully tested to ensure that they’re actually correct. In SVG, our main finding is that patches don’t need to be correct to be helpful for coding. Just like different code can lead to the same, correct solution, with SVG we generate synthetic training data by having patches that are only partially correct. This removes the need to thoroughly test for full correctness, which in turn alleviates the need for complex infrastructure for testing and costly generation of precise examples. We demonstrate that this soft-verified data scales exactly like "hard-verified" training data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scaling with a bug-type menu. To diversify data without becoming bottlenecked on finding real bugs, we draw from a taxonomy of 51 common bug patterns identified in prior analyses. For each function in a repository, we can generate multiple distinct bug-style prompts—so a repo with thousands of functions can yield tens of thousands of varied agentic trajectories at low cost.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High simulated workflow fidelity. A key finding is that high-quality synthetic training data should mirror the workflow of a developer rather than the precise details of correct code. This means correct coding data is less important than data that reflects how a developer works on a problem. Combined with SVG, this insight enables repository training: generating training data for any code repository, making it straightforward to scale synthetic data generation massively.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these innovations mean that if you or your organization has a private codebase, you can use SERA to fine-tune a small model to strong performance on your data—easily and affordably. Instead of designing a complicated RL pipeline and test harness for every new task setting, you generate targeted synthetic data and run a straightforward supervised fine-tuning (SFT) job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;State-of-the-art performance, accessible hardware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using SERA, we've developed a family of models ranging from 8B to 32B parameters, all built on Qwen3 and trained up to 32K context length with the help of various teacher models. We expect the same recipe to keep improving as we scale to larger backbones and context lengths, but the key point is that the current pipeline is already cheap and feasible for anyone to run, customize, and iterate on today—opening up wide access and endless possibilities for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our efficient technique enabled highly precise science. By keeping costs low, we could systematically disentangle the many factors that have made comparisons between agentic systems unreliable. This rigorous methodology drove rapid iteration, leading us from soft-verified generation to the full SERA approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we align inference conditions for fair comparison, SERA performs competitively with leading open coding agents. At 32K context, SERA-32B achieves 49.5% ± 1.9% on SWE-Bench Verified, comparable to Devstral Small 2 (50.0% ± 1.3%) and GLM-4.5-Air (50.5% ± 1.3%). At 64K context, SERA-32B reaches 54.2% ± 1.4%—competitive with longer-context baselines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong closed-weight coding agents like Devstral Small 2 are an important point of comparison. When we control for key variables, SERA-32B comes close: within ~0.5 points at 32K and ~4.9 points at 64K compared to Devstral Small 2 despite SERA being pure SFT and not trained beyond 32K tokens, both of which disadvantage longer-context evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also explored how teacher strength affects results. GLM-4.6 yields our best numbers, but GLM-4.5-Air gets surprisingly close at lower cost. The gap between teachers becomes most meaningful in higher-compute regimes—suggesting that depending on your budget and target performance, a weaker (and cheaper) teacher can be the better overall choice, especially for early iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To validate our synthetic data generation strategy, we tested repository-specific specialization on Django, SymPy, and Sphinx—the three largest repositories in SWE-Bench. Because these have actual test instances, we can quantify how well specialization works in practice. This serves as a proxy for the downstream use case we care most about: adapting to private codebases that may lack comprehensive tests or follow nonstandard structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are promising. Our specialized models – trained on 8,000 synthetic trajectories per repository – consistently match and often exceed the performance of the 100B+ parameter models we used as teachers. At 32K context, the specialized models achieve 52.23% on Django and 51.11% on SymPy, compared to GLM-4.5-Air's 51.20% and 48.89%. The gains are most pronounced on Django and SymPy, which together account for over 60% of all SWE-Bench problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results highlight two crucial advantages of our method. First, specialization pays off: a 32B model fine-tuned to a specific codebase can match or surpass a 100B+ general-purpose teacher, delivering comparable performance at one-third the size with lower memory requirements, faster inference, and reduced operational costs. Second, simplicity scales: our SFT-only pipeline on an open base model is now competitive with heavily engineered, large-team efforts. Together, these findings lower the barrier to entry for researchers, make results easier to reproduce, and turn agentic coding progress into something the whole community can validate and build on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Built for developers and researchers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our release package includes everything needed to reproduce, test, and build on SERA—a lightweight deployment requiring just two lines of code to launch an inference server. We've also developed a setup script and inference optimizations that make SERA directly compatible with Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key difference from closed-weight systems is our commitment to openness and reproducibility:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We release models, code, all generated agent data, and a full recipe to generate your own data so anyone can reproduce our results or customize them to new domains.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our training pipeline is intentionally simple—standard SFT on trajectories with no custom RL infrastructure needed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The total cost to reproduce performance levels of the best previous open-source result only is roughly $400 on commodity cloud GPUs, more than 25 times cheaper than many existing approaches that require complex distributed setups and still fall short on performance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The total cost to reproduce top open-weight models in industry, such as Devstral Small 2, is only $12,000.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe bringing the cost of replicating strong coding agents down to a few hundred dollars will unlock research that simply wasn't possible before. Instead of being limited to a handful of well-funded labs, agentic coding can become a widely accessible practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you're running locally on your hardware, deploying in the cloud, or fine-tuning on your own codebase, SERA delivers practical agentic coding within reach of developers, researchers, and small teams alike.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FBI Director Kash Patel said Monday that he had opened an investigation into the Signal group text chats that Minnesota residents are using to share information about federal immigration agents’ movements, launching a new front in the Trump administration’s conflict there with potential free speech implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patel said in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson that he wanted to know whether any Minnesota residents had put federal agents “in harm’s way” with activities such as sharing agents’ license plate numbers and locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You cannot create a scenario that illegally entraps and puts law enforcement in harm’s way,” he said in the interview, which was posted to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The investigation quickly drew skepticism from free speech advocates who said the First Amendment protects members of the public who share legally obtained information, such as the names of federal agents or where they are conducting enforcement operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are legitimate reasons to share such information, including enabling members of the public to observe and document law enforcement activity and to hold officials accountable for misconduct,” Aaron Terr, director of public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Given this administration’s poor track record of distinguishing protected speech from criminal conduct, any investigation like this deserves very close scrutiny,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For months, digital tools have been at the center of how people have pushed back against immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota and across the country. The administration’s opponents have used group text chats to track Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, share photos of suspected ICE vehicles and raise awareness for neighbors. In June, administration officials criticized ICEBlock, an app designed to share information about ICE sightings. Apple removed the app from its app store in October, prompting a lawsuit from the app’s developer alleging the administration unlawfully pressured Apple to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past few days, the group text chats — especially those on the encrypted messaging app Signal — have drawn attention from right-wing media. On Saturday, Cam Higby, a conservative journalist based near Seattle, said in a thread on X that he had “infiltrated” Signal groups from around Minneapolis that he alleged were obstructing law enforcement. His thread, which got 20 million views, focused on how the groups share such information as the license plate numbers of suspected federal vehicles. NBC News has not verified Higby’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patel said he got the idea for the investigation from Higby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As soon as Higby put that post out, I opened an investigation on it,” he said. “We immediately opened up that investigation, because that sort of Signal chat — being coordinated with individuals not just locally in Minnesota, but maybe even around the country — if that leads to a break in the federal statute or a violation of some law, then we are going to arrest people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Signal Foundation, the nonprofit organization that operates the Signal app, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signal, which is considered one of the most secure chat apps, is a go-to resource for people concerned about privacy. It is perhaps best known as the app Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used to share sensitive military information last year in a group chat that accidentally included a journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Twin Cities, Signal group chats have been a standard part of toolkits — along with walkie-talkies and whistles — used by activists, parents and neighborhood-watch members who have organized as volunteers to warn families about immigration enforcement activities by relaying real-time information, especially near schools. Patrol volunteers have said that, with more than 3,000 federal immigration agents in Minnesota, they are motivated by a desire to protect parents, children and school staff members who are not U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patel did not say which laws he thought Minnesota residents may have violated. An FBI spokesperson said the bureau had no further information to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement seemed likely to have implications for the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech. Alex Abdo, litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the First Amendment protects the right to record law enforcement officers as they carry out their official responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The ability of everyday citizens to hold government agents to account, by observing them and advocating for change, is what has distinguished the American experiment with democracy from authoritarian regimes around the world,” Abdo said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Unless the FBI has evidence of a crime, and not just evidence of activity the Constitution protects, it should stand down,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patel acknowledged in the interview with Johnson that an investigation into group text chats would raise free speech concerns and said the FBI would “balance” the rights guaranteed by the First and Second amendments with what he said were potential violations of federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Now, we will balance the First and Second amendment constantly, but we have to let the community know that we will not tolerate acts of violence and an escalation and a violation of the federal code,” he said. The Second Amendment could be at issue because Alex Pretti, the nurse shot and killed by a federal agent Saturday in Minneapolis, was permitted to carry a gun in public and had one with him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terr, of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said the government does not get to “balance” the First Amendment against its other interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Constitution takes precedence over any conflicting state or federal law, and over any official’s desire to suppress speech they dislike,” he said in his email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He added: “There is a First Amendment exception for speech intended and likely to provoke imminent unlawful action, but that doesn’t apply to just any speech the government claims puts officials in harm’s way. By contrast, if individuals are threatening federal agents or conspiring to physically harm them, that is illegal. But conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a specific crime and a substantial step toward carrying it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patel also said the FBI had made “substantial progress” in an investigation into groups and people responsible for funding resistance to immigration enforcement. He alleged that the protests and neighborhood monitoring are “not happening organically” but did not immediately provide evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey HN, we're the co-founders of LemonSlice (try our HN playground here: &lt;/p&gt;https://lemonslice.com/hn&lt;p&gt;). We train interactive avatar video models. Our API lets you upload a photo and immediately jump into a FaceTime-style call with that character. Here's a demo: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.loom.com/share/941577113141418e80d2834c83a5a0a9&lt;p&gt;Chatbots are everywhere and voice AI has taken off, but we believe video avatars will be the most common form factor for conversational AI. Most people would rather watch something than read it. The problem is that generating video in real-time is hard, and overcoming the uncanny valley is even harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We haven’t broken the uncanny valley yet. Nobody has. But we’re getting close and our photorealistic avatars are currently best-in-class (judge for yourself: https://lemonslice.com/try/taylor). Plus, we're the only avatar model that can do animals and heavily stylized cartoons. Try it: https://lemonslice.com/try/alien. Warning! Talking to this little guy may improve your mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we're releasing our new model* - Lemon Slice 2, a 20B-parameter diffusion transformer that generates infinite-length video at 20fps on a single GPU - and opening up our API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did we get a video diffusion model to run in real-time? There was no single trick, just a lot of them stacked together. The first big change was making our model causal. Standard video diffusion models are bidirectional (they look at frames both before and after the current one), which means you can't stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there it was about fitting everything on one GPU. We switched from full to sliding window attention, which killed our memory bottleneck. We distilled from 40 denoising steps down to just a few - quality degraded less than we feared, especially after using GAN-based distillation (though tuning that adversarial loss to avoid mode collapse was its own adventure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the rest was inference work: modifying RoPE from complex to real (this one was cool!), precision tuning, fusing kernels, a special rolling KV cache, lots of other caching, and more. We kept shaving off milliseconds wherever we could and eventually got to real-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set up a guest playground for HN so you can create and talk to characters without logging in: https://lemonslice.com/hn. For those who want to build with our API (we have a new LiveKit integration that we’re pumped about!), grab a coupon code in the HN playground for your first Pro month free ($100 value). See the docs: https://lemonslice.com/docs. Pricing is usage-based at $0.12-0.20/min for video generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Tell us what characters you want to see in the comments and we can make them for you to talk to (e.g. Max Headroom)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*We did a Show HN last year for our V1 model: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43785044. It was technically impressive but so bad compared to what we have today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Science shapes nearly every part of daily life—from the medicines we rely on, to the energy that powers our homes, to the systems that keep us safe. But the pace of scientific progress is still constrained by how research is done day to day. While AI has advanced rapidly, much of the everyday work of science still relies on tools that haven’t fundamentally changed in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re introducing Prism, a free, AI-native workspace for scientists to write and collaborate on research, powered by GPT‑5.2. Prism offers unlimited projects and collaborators and is available today to anyone with a ChatGPT personal account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism will be available soon to organizations using ChatGPT Business, Enterprise, and Education plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve begun to see AI accelerate scientific work across domains. Advanced reasoning systems like GPT‑5 are helping push the frontiers of mathematics, accelerating the analysis of human immune-cell experiments, and speeding up experimental iteration in molecular biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re still early, but it’s clear that AI will play a meaningful role in how science advances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, much of the everyday work of research—drafting papers, revising arguments, managing equations and citations, and coordinating with collaborators —remains fragmented across disconnected tools. Researchers often move between editors, PDFs, LaTeX compilers, reference managers, and separate chat interfaces, losing context and interrupting focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism is our first step toward addressing this fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism is a free workspace for scientific writing and collaboration, with GPT‑5.2—our most advanced model for mathematical and scientific reasoning—integrated directly into the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It brings drafting, revision, collaboration, and preparation for publication into a single, cloud-based, LaTeX-native workspace. Rather than operating as a separate tool alongside the writing process, GPT‑5.2 works within the project itself—with access to the structure of the paper, equations, references, and surrounding context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism builds on the foundation of Crixet, a cloud-based LaTeX platform that OpenAI acquired and has since evolved into Prism as a unified product. This allowed us to start with a strong base of a mature writing and collaboration environment, and integrate AI in a way that fits naturally into scientific workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Prism, researchers can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chat with GPT‑5.2 Thinking, to explore ideas, test hypotheses, and reason through complex scientific problems in context&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Draft and revise papers with the full document as context, including surrounding text, equations, citations, figures, and overall structure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search for and incorporate relevant literature (for example, from arXiv) in the context of the current manuscript, and revise text in light of newly identified related work&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create, refactor, and reason over equations, citations, and figures, with AI that understands how those elements relate across the paper&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Turn whiteboard equations or diagrams directly into LaTeX, saving hours of time manipulating graphics pixel-by-pixel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collaborate with co-authors, students, and advisors in real time, with edits, comments, and revisions reflected immediately&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make direct, in-place changes to the document when requested, without copying content between separate editors or chat tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use optional voice-based editing to make simple changes without interrupting writing or review&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientific research is inherently collaborative. Papers are shaped over time by co-authors, students, advisors, and reviewers, often across institutions and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism supports unlimited collaborators, allowing research teams to work together without seat limits or access barriers. Because it’s cloud-based, there’s no local LaTeX installation or environment management required, making it easier for teams to collaborate in a shared workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By reducing version conflicts, manual merging, and mechanical overhead, Prism helps teams spend less time managing files and more time engaging with the substance of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, Prism is designed to expand access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism is free to use, and anyone with a ChatGPT account can start writing immediately. There are no subscriptions or seat limits. By making high-quality scientific tools easier to adopt and broadly available, we hope to enable more researchers—across institutions, disciplines, and career stages—to participate fully in the scientific process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More powerful AI features will be made available through paid ChatGPT plans over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2025, AI changed software development forever. In 2026, we expect a comparable shift in science, as AI begins to meaningfully accelerate discovery in several ways, one of which is reducing friction in day-to-day research work. Prism is an early step toward that future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to learn from researchers using Prism today and to continue building toward tools that help science move faster—together. Try Prism for free today at prism.openai.com(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How Many Chess Games are Possible?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Long games with many possibilities&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of his results are derived from building monster cooperative games with clever mechanisms creating a great numbers of possible games. As we see in the example below, board positions in long games tend to look a bit atypical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will restrict ourselves to typical and short chess games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Warmup: the number of typical games by the Fermi problem method&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the chess problem we propose the estimate &lt;code&gt;number_of_typical_games ~ typical_number_of_options_per_movetypical_number_of_moves_per_game&lt;/code&gt;. This equation is subjective, in that it isn’t yet justified beyond our opinion that it might be a good estimate. It is then a matter of finding usable values for &lt;code&gt;typical_number_of_moves_per_game&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;typical_number_of_options_per_move&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The x-axis shows the number of half moves (per player moves, also called “ply”) and the y-axis is the number of games ending at this number of moves in Ahle’s sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this graph we can take 100 half-moves (or 50 moves for each player) as a simple, not too far off typical game length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then our Fermi estimate is that there are easily on order of (101.66)100 = 10166 typical games of chess. This has some of the grace I tried to describe in “The Joy of Calculation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Knuth path product estimate&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Estimating from a single game&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; generated by generating legal moves uniformly at random.
&lt;p&gt;End of sample game (move 43, White checkmates Black)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;” we then replace our Fermi estimate of
&lt;code&gt;
    typical_number_of_options_per_movetypical_number_of_moves_per_game
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with Knuth’s path product estimator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    p(g) = ∏i number_of_legal_moves_in_position(g[i])
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;g[i]&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;-th position in the single game &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; we are examining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the sample game was exactly typical (i.e. lasted for exactly &lt;code&gt;typical_number_of_moves_per_game&lt;/code&gt; half moves and always had &lt;code&gt;typical_number_of_options_per_move&lt;/code&gt; legal moves per position) these two calculations would be identical. Things are rarely so perfectly “typical”, so we expect this new estimate to often be over or under the original Fermi method estimate (depending on which game we use as our working example).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; be the set of all possible short chess games. We want to know &lt;code&gt;|G|&lt;/code&gt;, the size of &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt;. The issue is &lt;code&gt;|G|&lt;/code&gt; is so large that we can not hope to directly enumerate all of the elements of &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; to directly perform the counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theorem: &lt;code&gt;(1 / |G|) ∑g in G p(g) = |G|&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is traditionally written in terms of the expected value operator as &lt;code&gt;Eg in G[p(g)] = |G|&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knuth considered this surprising enough that he wrote: “We shall consider two proofs, at least one of which should be convincing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is: we can approximate the average on the left side of the equations, and this now means we can approximate &lt;code&gt;|G|&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Estimating from many games&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A larger sample&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a check, our two sample based estimates rendered to more digits in the exponent are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Smaller sample estimate is 10150.94&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Larger sample estimate is 10151.27.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How reliable is the path sampling scheme?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case where we know there are no large monster games hiding, the procedure is preternaturally accurate. For example, the graph below is the percent error in estimating the number of chess games that reach at least the first k-ply for k equals 1 through 15. For these very short games the exact values of the counts are reported in The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences A048987, allowing us to check our results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we switch from the Fermi problem method to the Knuth path-product method we:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Avoid having to guess a useful subjective arithmetic form.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Become more able to incorporate the exact rules of the system we are exploring.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Remove the need for subjective estimated inputs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Can try to “buy reliability” by building larger samples.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, the methods apply to a lot more than just chess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Categories: Computer Science Mathematics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time Station Emulator turns almost any phone or tablet into a low-frequency radio transmitter broadcasting a time signal that can synchronize most radio-controlled (“atomic”) clocks and watches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real time signal broadcasts are limited in geographic range and notoriously prone to interference in urban areas, so many such clocks end up never actually using their self-setting functionality. Time Station Emulator may allow setting such clocks when/where a suitable signal is not otherwise available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compatible with most radio-controlled clocks: Emulates the five operational radio time signal stations (🇨🇳 BPC, 🇩🇪 DCF77, 🇯🇵 JJY, 🇬🇧 MSF, and 🇺🇸 WWVB).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Network time: Derives the current time from the network using an NTP-like algorithm.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Location-agnostic: Supports applying an offset to the transmitted time of ±24 hours from the present.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BST/CEST/DST-aware: Transmits daylight saving time information for DCF77, MSF, and WWVB.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Leap second-aware: Transmits a DUT1 offset for MSF and WWVB.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Client-side, browser-based: Runs entirely in the browser; no installation, no signup, no data collection.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hard requirements of note are browser WebAssembly support and DAC support for ≥44.1 KHz PCM. Almost any device running a browser from ≥2019 should work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, as of early 2024, Safari on iOS and Firefox on Android have multiple breaking issues and will not work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For other devices, Time Station Emulator works best with a built-in speaker of a phone or tablet. See Technical Details for an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time Station Emulator is hosted at https://timestation.pages.dev/.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choose emulator settings.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The most important setting is which time station to emulate. Certain settings are only available for certain stations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clocks (or watches) that support more than one station may prefer one of them over the others.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choose any clock settings and place the clock into sync mode.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If your clock has them, try to choose station and/or time zone settings that make sense for your location.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most clocks provide a way to force a synchronization attempt. You will probably have to navigate menus and/or press physical buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Position the speaker as close as possible to the clock’s antenna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transmission range is quite short, so positioning is crucial. Some experimentation will probably be required, especially if you’re unsure where the antenna is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volume should be set so that the clock picks up the cleanest signal. Usually, this occurs at or near the maximum possible volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;th&gt;WARNING&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;DO NOT PLACE YOUR EARS NEAR THE SPEAKER TO DETERMINE VOLUME.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Use a visual volume indicator instead.&lt;lb/&gt;The generated waveform has full dynamic range, but is pitched high enough to be difficult to perceive.&lt;lb/&gt;Even if you “can’t hear anything”, many common devices are capable of playing it back loud enough to potentially cause permanent hearing damage!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start transmitting and hold the speaker in position.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If all goes well, the clock will set itself within three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Time Station Emulator generates an audio waveform intentionally crafted to create, when played back through consumer-grade audio hardware, the right kind of RF noise to be mistaken for a time station broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, given a fundamental carrier frequency used by a real time station, it generates and modulates the highest odd-numbered subharmonic that also falls below the Nyquist frequencies of common playback sample rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the higher-frequency harmonics inevitably created by any real-world DAC during playback will then be the original fundamental, which should leak to the environment as a short-range radio transmission via the ad-hoc antenna formed by the physical wires and circuit traces in the audio output path.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Parametric CAD in Rust&lt;/head&gt;January 27, 2026&lt;p&gt;I keep designing physical parts for our robots. Motor mounts, sensor brackets, wheel hubs. Every time, the workflow is the same: open a GUI CAD program, click around for an hour, export an STL, realize the bolt pattern is 2mm off, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write my parts the way I write firmware. In Rust. With types. With version control. With the ability to change one number and regenerate everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I built vcad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo add vcad
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The idea&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A part is just geometry with a name. You create primitives, combine them with boolean operations, and export. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;use vcad::{centered_cube, centered_cylinder, bolt_pattern};

let plate = centered_cube("plate", 120.0, 80.0, 5.0);
let bore = centered_cylinder("bore", 15.0, 10.0, 64);
let bolts = bolt_pattern(6, 50.0, 4.5, 10.0, 32);

let part = plate - bore - bolts;
part.write_stl("plate.stl").unwrap();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;That minus sign is a real boolean difference. &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is union. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is intersection. Operator overloads make CSG feel like arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plate above has a center bore, four corner mounting holes, and a six-bolt circle pattern. Twelve lines of code. One STL file. Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you can build&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The API is small on purpose. Primitives, booleans, transforms, patterns. That's the whole language. But it composes well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An L-bracket with mounting holes in both faces:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let base = centered_cube("base", 60.0, 40.0, 4.0);
let wall = centered_cube("wall", 60.0, 4.0, 36.0)
    .translate(0.0, -18.0, 20.0);
let bracket = base + wall - base_holes - wall_holes;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flanged hub with a bolt circle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let hub = centered_cylinder("hub", 15.0, 20.0, 64);
let flange = centered_cylinder("flange", 30.0, 4.0, 64)
    .translate(0.0, 0.0, -10.0);
let part = hub + flange - bore - bolt_pattern(6, 45.0, 3.0, 8.0, 32);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;A radial vent pattern cut from a disc — one slot, repeated eight times:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let slot = centered_cube("slot", 15.0, 2.0, 10.0);
let vents = slot.circular_pattern(20.0, 8);
let panel = centered_cylinder("panel", 35.0, 3.0, 64) - vents;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every part here is parametric. Change the bolt count, the radius, the wall thickness — one number changes and the whole part regenerates. No clicking. No undo. Just recompile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multi-material export&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;STL is fine for 3D printing, but it throws away all material information. For visualization, vcad exports glTF scenes with PBR materials defined in TOML:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let materials = Materials::parse(r#"
    [materials.body]
    color = [0.32, 0.72, 0.95]
    metallic = 0.1
    roughness = 0.5

    [materials.antenna]
    color = [0.95, 0.3, 0.35]
    metallic = 0.3
"#).unwrap();

let mut scene = Scene::new("mascot");
scene.add(body, "body");
scene.add(antenna_ball, "antenna");
export_scene_glb(&amp;amp;scene, &amp;amp;materials, "mascot.glb").unwrap();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's our mascot. Entirely CSG. A rounded cube intersected with a sphere for the body, spheres for eyes, cylinders for arms. Eight materials, seventeen parts, one GLB file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Rust&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geometry engine is manifold, which guarantees watertight meshes from boolean operations. The Rust bindings give us zero-cost abstractions over the C++ core — the operator overloads compile down to direct manifold calls. No garbage collection pauses. No floating point surprises from a scripting layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But honestly, the main reason is the toolchain. &lt;code&gt;cargo test&lt;/code&gt; runs 21 unit tests that verify volumes, surface areas, bounding boxes, and export round-trips. &lt;code&gt;cargo clippy&lt;/code&gt; catches issues before they become parts with holes in the wrong place. Types prevent you from passing a radius where a diameter was expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAD files should be code. Code has tests, reviews, diffs, and CI. An STL file has... bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Built for agents&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I care about that most CAD tools don't: vcad is designed to be used by AI coding agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The README has full API tables, a cookbook with copy-pasteable recipes, and a section on Blender MCP integration. An agent can read the docs, generate a part, export it, import it into Blender, position a camera, and render a preview — all in one conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every render in this post was made that way. Claude generated the geometry with vcad, imported each STL/GLB into Blender via MCP, set up studio lighting, and rendered to PNG. No human touched Blender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feedback loop is: describe a part → code generates → mesh exports → render previews → iterate. All in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Try it&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo add vcad
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Docs: docs.rs/vcad&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Source: github.com/ecto/vcad&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Site: vcad.io&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's MIT licensed. The first version is 0.1 — there's a lot more to build. Fillets, chamfers, threads, an interactive web GUI. But the core is solid: primitives, booleans, transforms, export. Everything you need to stop clicking and start typing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go make something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;TikTok settles just before social media addiction trial to begin&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TikTok has reached a settlement to avoid it being involved in a landmark social media addiction trial - a matter of hours before jury selection was due to begin in California.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plaintiff, a 20-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, alleges the design of platforms' algorithms left her addicted to social media and negatively affected her mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The parties are pleased to have reached an amicable resolution of this dispute," the Social Media Victims Law Center said of the TikTok settlement, adding the terms were confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The defendants now include Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook and YouTube parent Google. Snapchat settled with the plaintiff last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Dangerous and addictive algorithms'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The named social media companies have said the plaintiff's evidence falls short of proving they are responsible for alleged harms such as depression and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The case going to trial marks a distinct shift in how the US legal system treats tech firms, which face mounting claims that their products lead to addictive behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The companies have long argued that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress in 1996, exempts platforms from liability for what third parties post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But at issue in this case are design choices about algorithms, notifications and other features that affect how people use their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KGM's attorney, Matthew Bergman, told the BBC the case will be the first time a social media company has been held to account by a jury at trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, there are all too many kids in the United States, the UK, and around the world who are suffering as KGM does because of the dangerous and addictive algorithms that the social media platforms foist on unsuspecting kids," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These companies are going to have to explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the lives of our young people."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, told the BBC that losing these cases in court could pose an existential threat to the social media companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he said it may be difficult for plaintiffs to prove physical harms can be blamed on content publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The fact that the plaintiffs have been able to sell that idea has opened the door to a whole bunch of new legal questions that the law wasn't really designed to answer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'The tech industry has been given deferential treatment'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At trial, jurors are expected to see an array of evidence, including excerpts from internal company documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A lot of what these companies have been trying to shield from the public is likely going to be aired in court," said Mary Graw Leary, a law professor at Catholic University of America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta says it has introduced dozens of tools to support a safer environment for teens online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people," it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers have previously questioned the effectiveness of Meta's safety interventions - Meta argued the researchers had not properly understood how the tools it had introduced worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The companies are expected to argue any asserted harms are caused by third-party users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One highly-anticipated witness the jury will hear from is Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who is due to testify early in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, he told US senators "the existing body of scientific work has not shown any causal link between social media and young people having worse mental health outcomes".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During that same hearing, at the prodding of one senator, Zuckerberg apologised to victims and their loved ones who had crowded into the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech executives "are often not good under pressure" said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She said the firms were "very much much hoping" they could avoid having top bosses testify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trial comes as the companies face growing scrutiny from families, school districts, and prosecutors worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, dozens of US states sued Meta, alleging the company misled the public over risks of social media use and had contributed to a youth mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australia has enacted a social media ban on under-16s, and the UK signalled in January it may follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There is a tipping point when it comes to the harms of social media," Franks said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The tech industry has been given deferential treatment - I think we're seeing that start to change."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;zachxbt has alleged that "Lick" is a man named John Daghita. After reporting Daghita's identity, "Lick" appeared to try to scrub his Telegram account, then dusted zachxbt's public crypto wallet from one of the theft addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daghitia is reportedly the son of Dean Daghita, the owner of Command Services &amp;amp; Support (CMDSS). In October 2024, CMDSS landed a contract with the US Marshals to manage seized crypto assets, which is still active. After zachxbt linked the younger Daghita to his father and CMDSS, CMDSS also scrubbed its online presence. Around that time, Lick began trolling zachxbt again, and later sent 0.6767 ETH (~$1,900) of the stolen funds to zachxbt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CMDSS' website boasts that they are "a proven provider of mission-critical services to the Department of Defense and Department of Justice".&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Some notes on starting to use Django&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello! One of my favourite things is starting to learn an Old Boring Technology that I’ve never tried before but that has been around for 20+ years. It feels really good when every problem I’m ever going to have has been solved already 1000 times and I can just get stuff done easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve thought it would be cool to learn a popular web framework like Rails or Django or Laravel for a long time, but I’d never really managed to make it happen. But I started learning Django to make a website a few months back, I’ve been liking it so far, and here are a few quick notes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;less magic than Rails&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spent some time trying to learn Rails in 2020, and while it was cool and I really wanted to like Rails (the Ruby community is great!), I found that if I left my Rails project alone for months, when I came back to it it was hard for me to remember how to get anything done because (for example) if it says &lt;code&gt;resources :topics&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;routes.rb&lt;/code&gt;, on its own
that doesn’t tell you where the &lt;code&gt;topics&lt;/code&gt; routes are configured, you need to
remember or look up the convention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being able to abandon a project for months or years and then come back to it is really important to me (that’s how all my projects work!), and Django feels easier to me because things are more explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my small Django project it feels like I just have 5 main files (other than the settings files): &lt;code&gt;urls.py&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;models.py&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;views.py&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;admin.py&lt;/code&gt;, and
&lt;code&gt;tests.py&lt;/code&gt;, and if I want to know where something else is (like an HTML template)
is then it’s usually explicitly referenced from one of those files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;a built-in admin&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this project I wanted to have an admin interface to manually edit or view some of the data in the database. Django has a really nice built-in admin interface, and I can customize it with just a little bit of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, here’s part of one of my admin classes, which sets up which fields to display in the “list” view, which field to search on, and how to order them by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@admin.register(Zine)
class ZineAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ["name", "publication_date", "free", "slug", "image_preview"]
    search_fields = ["name", "slug"]
    readonly_fields = ["image_preview"]
    ordering = ["-publication_date"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;it’s fun to have an ORM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past my attitude has been “ORMs? Who needs them? I can just write my own SQL queries!”. I’ve been enjoying Django’s ORM so far though, and I think it’s cool how Django uses &lt;code&gt;__&lt;/code&gt; to represent a &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Zine.objects
    .exclude(product__order__email_hash=email_hash)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This query involves 5 tables: &lt;code&gt;zines&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;zine_products&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;products&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;order_products&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;orders&lt;/code&gt;.
To make this work I just had to tell Django that there’s a &lt;code&gt;ManyToManyField&lt;/code&gt;
relating “orders” and “products”, and another &lt;code&gt;ManyToManyField&lt;/code&gt; relating
“zines”, and “products”, so that it knows how to connect &lt;code&gt;zines&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;orders&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;products&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I definitely could write that query, but writing &lt;code&gt;product__order__email_hash&lt;/code&gt; is
a lot less typing, it feels a lot easier to read, and honestly I think it would
take me a little while to figure out how to construct the query
(which needs to do a few other things than just those joins).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have zero concern about the performance of my ORM-generated queries so I’m pretty excited about ORMs for now, though I’m sure I’ll find things to be frustrated with eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;automatic migrations!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other great thing about the ORM is migrations!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I add, delete, or change a field in &lt;code&gt;models.py&lt;/code&gt;, Django will automatically
generate a migration script like &lt;code&gt;migrations/0006_delete_imageblob.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I assume that I could edit those scripts if I wanted, but so far I’ve just been running the generated scripts with no change and it’s been going great. It really feels like magic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m realizing that being able to do migrations easily is important for me right now because I’m changing my data model fairly often as I figure out how I want it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;I like the docs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had a bad habit of never reading the documentation but I’ve been really enjoying the parts of Django’s docs that I’ve read so far. This isn’t by accident: Jacob Kaplan-Moss has a talk from PyCon 2011 on Django’s documentation culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example the intro to models lists the most important common fields you might want to set when using the ORM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;using sqlite&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After having a bad experience trying to operate Postgres and not being able to understand what was going on, I decided to run all of my small websites with SQLite instead. It’s been going way better, and I love being able to backup by just doing a &lt;code&gt;VACUUM INTO&lt;/code&gt; and then copying the resulting single file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been following these instructions for using SQLite with Django in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it should be fine because I’m expecting the site to have a few hundred writes per day at most, much less than Mess with DNS which has a lot more of writes and has been working well (though the writes are split across 3 different SQLite databases).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;built in email (and more)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Django seems to be very “batteries-included”, which I love – if I want CSRF protection, or a &lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy&lt;/code&gt;, or I want to send email, it’s all
in there!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, I wanted to save the emails Django sends to a file in dev mode (so that it didn’t send real email to real people), which was just a little bit of configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just put this &lt;code&gt;settings/dev.py&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_FILE_PATH = BASE_DIR / "emails"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and then set up the production email like this in &lt;code&gt;settings/production.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.whatever.com"
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "xxxx"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.getenv('EMAIL_API_KEY')
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That made me feel like if I want some other basic website feature, there’s likely to be an easy way to do it built into Django already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;the settings file still feels like a lot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m still a bit intimidated by the &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; file: Django’s settings system
works by setting a bunch of global variables in a file, and I feel a bit
stressed about… what if I make a typo in the name of one of those variables?
How will I know? What if I type &lt;code&gt;WSGI_APPLICATOIN = "config.wsgi.application"&lt;/code&gt;
instead of &lt;code&gt;WSGI_APPLICATION&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess I’ve gotten used to having a Python language server tell me when I’ve made a typo and so now it feels a bit disorienting when I can’t rely on the language server support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;that’s all for now!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven’t really successfully used an actual web framework for a project before (right now almost all of my websites are either a single Go binary or static sites), so I’m interested in seeing how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s still lots for me to learn about, I still haven’t really gotten into Django’s form validation tooling or authentication systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Marco Rogers for convincing me to give ORMs a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(we’re still experimenting with the comments-on-Mastodon system! Here are the comments on Mastodon! tell me your favourite Django feature!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Autonomous zero-day discovery in one of the most scrutinized codebases in the world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AISLE's autonomous analyzer found all 12 CVEs in the January 2026 coordinated release of OpenSSL, the open-source cryptographic library that underpins a substantial proportion of the world’s secure communications. Some of these vulnerabilities had persisted in OpenSSL code for decades, evading the notice of thousands of security researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding a genuine security flaw in OpenSSL is extraordinarily difficult. Even a single accepted vulnerability represents a rare achievement. The library's maturity and the community's vigilance make new discoveries exceptionally uncommon. This makes the January 2026 release an important milestone for autonomous security systems. As Tomáš Mráz, CTO of the OpenSSL Foundation, says,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One of the most important sources of the security of the OpenSSL Library and open source projects overall is independent research. This release is fixing 12 security issues, all disclosed to us by AISLE. We appreciate the high quality of the reports and their constructive collaboration with us throughout the remediation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll give an overview of our discoveries and explain why we think this is a watershed moment for AI-powered software security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Discoveries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AISLE Research Team started hunting for OpenSSL vulnerabilities with our autonomous analyzer in August 2025. You can read about the three discoveries we made in Q3 of 2025 here. All of our discoveries were reported through responsible disclosure and resolved through coordinated releases with the OpenSSL project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;High and Moderate Severity CVEs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2025-15467: Stack Buffer Overflow in CMS AuthEnvelopedData Parsing (High): A vulnerability with the potential to enable remote code execution under specific conditions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2025-11187: PBMAC1 Parameter Validation in PKCS#12 (Moderate): Missing validation that could trigger a stack-based buffer overflow&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Low Severity CVEs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2025-15468: Crash in QUIC protocol cipher handling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2025-15469: Silent truncation bug affecting post-quantum signature algorithms (ML-DSA)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2025-66199: Memory exhaustion via TLS 1.3 certificate compression&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2025-68160: Memory corruption in line-buffering (affects code back to OpenSSL 1.0.2)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2025-69418: Encryption flaw in OCB mode on hardware-accelerated paths&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2025-69419: Memory corruption in PKCS#12 character encoding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2025-69420: Crash in TimeStamp Response verification&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2025-69421: Crash in PKCS#12 decryption&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2026-22795: Crash in PKCS#12 parsing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CVE-2026-22796: Crash in PKCS#7 signature verification (affects code back to OpenSSL 1.0.2)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AISLE’s analyzer also recommended fixes which were incorporated directly into OpenSSL for 5 of the 12 CVEs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Beyond CVEs: Catching Bugs Before They Ship&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the 12 CVEs, 6 findings were never assigned a designation. In each case, AISLE detected the issue, reported it to the maintainers, and the fix was merged before the vulnerable code ever appeared in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;By integrating autonomous analysis directly into development workflows, security issues were identified and resolved before they reached users. That is our goal: preventing vulnerabilities, not merely patching them after deployment.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What This Means&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL represents one of the most deployed, battle-tested, and carefully maintained open-source projects in existence. The fact that 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities could still be found there, including issues dating back to 1998, suggests that manual review faces significant limits, even in mature, heavily audited codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human reviewers are constrained by time, attention, and the sheer volume of code in modern systems. Traditional static analysis catches certain bug classes but struggles with complex logic errors and timing-dependent issues. By contrast, autonomous AI-driven analysis operates at a different scale. It can examine code paths and edge cases that would take human reviewers months to cover, and it runs continuously rather than periodically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean that AI can replace human expertise. The OpenSSL maintainers' deep knowledge of the codebase was essential for validating findings and developing robust fixes. But it does change the SLA of security. When autonomous discovery is paired with responsible disclosure, it collapses the time-to-remediation for the entire ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 12 OpenSSL vulnerabilities we identified, spanning 8+ subsystems from CMS to QUIC to post-quantum signatures, represent a milestone in our (admittedly ambitious) mission: moving from reactive patching to securing the software foundation that modern civilization depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Collaboration with OpenSSL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the moment our system flagged these anomalies, we approached this as a partnership with the OpenSSL community. We submitted detailed technical reports through their coordinated security reporting process, including complete reproduction steps, root cause analysis, and concrete patch proposals. In each case, our proposed fixes either informed or were directly adopted by the OpenSSL team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Matt Caswell, Executive Director of the OpenSSL Foundation, said, “Keeping widely deployed cryptography secure requires tight coordination between maintainers and researchers. We appreciate AISLE's responsible disclosures and the quality of their engagement across these issues."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL team's responsiveness was exceptional. Under the leadership of Tomáš Mráz, the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) at the OpenSSL Foundation, the maintainers engaged technically at every stage: validating findings, refining patches, coordinating releases across multiple branches, and synchronizing with downstream distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you have a controller plugged in, it should work too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Don't worry about reporting bugs. I probably already know about it - it'll get fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
