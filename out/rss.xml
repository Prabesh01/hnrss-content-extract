  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BENGALURU, Dec 1 (Reuters) - India's telecoms ministry has privately asked smartphone makers to preload all new devices with a state-owned cyber security app that cannot be deleted, a government order showed, a move likely to antagonise Apple and privacy advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In tackling a recent surge of cyber crime and hacking, India is joining authorities worldwide, most recently in Russia, to frame rules blocking the use of stolen phones for fraud or promoting state-backed government service apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL.O), which has previously locked horns with the telecoms regulator over development of a government anti-spam mobile app, is among the companies, such as Samsung (005930.KS), Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi (1810.HK) bound by the new order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The November 28 order, seen by Reuters, gives major smartphone companies 90 days to ensure that the government's Sanchar Saathi app is pre-installed on new mobile phones, with a provision that users cannot disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For devices already in the supply chain, manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates, the ministry said in its order, which was not made public and was sent privately to select companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lawyer specialising in technology matters said India's move was cause for concern, however.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The government effectively removes user consent as a meaningful choice," said Mishi Choudhary, who works on internet advocacy issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy advocates criticised a similar requirement by Russia in August for a state-backed messenger app called MAX to be pre-installed on phones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the world's largest telephone markets, India has more than 1.2 billion subscribers, and government figures show the app, launched in January, has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones, including 50,000 in October alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;APPLE OFTEN REFUSES SUCH REQUESTS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government said the app was essential to combat "serious endangerment" of telecom cyber security from duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers, which enable scams and network misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple's iOS powered an estimated 4.5% of 735 million smartphones in India by mid-2025, with the rest using Android, Counterpoint Research says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Apple pre-installs its own proprietary apps on phones, its internal policies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before sale of a smartphone, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Apple has historically refused such requests from governments," said Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's likely to seek a middle ground: instead of a mandatory pre-install, they might negotiate and ask for an option to nudge users towards installing the app."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple, Google, Samsung and Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment. India's telecoms ministry also did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 14- to 17-digit number unique to each handset, the IMEI, or International Mobile Equipment Identity, is most commonly used to cut off network access for phones reported to have been stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is mainly designed to help users block and track lost or stolen smartphones across all telecom networks, using a central registry. It also lets them identify, and disconnect, fraudulent mobile connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With more than 5 million downloads since its launch, the app has helped block more than 3.7 million stolen or lost mobile phones, while more than 30 million fraudulent connections have also been terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government says it helps prevent cyber threats and assists tracking and blocking of lost or stolen phones, helping police to trace devices, while keeping counterfeits out of the black market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Self-hosting a Matrix server for 5 years&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experiences with the Matrix protocol, Matrix Synapse server, bridges, and Element mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been hosting a Matrix server for about five years now, mostly for text chats between a few relatives and close friends, and a bridge to WhatsApp for a few more people. These are my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Matrix protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't have many thoughts on the protocol itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing that I don't really understand is the decision on data replication. If a user on server A joins a room on server B, recent room data is copied from server B to server A and then kept in sync on both servers. I suppose this reduces the load on the original server at the expense of federation overhead and space on other servers. However, this also creates a situation where anything said across federation cannot be unsaid, which is an ironic situation for a protocol/system that often comes up when talking about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IIRC, fediverse/ActivityPub uses a similar approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Synapse server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synapse is the only choice that supports bridges, which was why I wanted to try Matrix in the first place. And back in 2019-2020 this was the only choice anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of right now, I run Synapse, PostgreSQL, and coturn directly, without containerization, on a small VPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Works well&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Works fairly reliably, supports bridges, and is more efficient that it was in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;API is well documented, and allows authenticating and sending (unencrypted) messages via simple HTTP calls. At some point in time, I wanted to write a simple shell client to use with SXMO and such.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Does not have an admin panel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no admin page or panel. There was a third-party admin site, but it's an entire site just for making HTTP calls. So I ended up writing my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Nowadays, the ESS deployment includes developer-made admin, see Future section)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Requires PostgreSQL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While technically, Synapse can work with a sqlite database (and which at first seems like an OK choice for having &amp;lt;10 users on the server), it WILL become corrupted. So PostgreSQL is de-facto mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Already a part of new ESS)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Requires federation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initial setup presumes that the server is going to be federated, and there is no good way to turn it off. The best workaround involves a blank whitelist of federated servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub issue: Single config option to disable federation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know the implications of disabling it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Needs constant cleanup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Message retention policy can be set up server-wide, but also per-room. There are specific lines in the configuration that need to be set to actually enable a service that runs the cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synapse keeps the room even after all of the members leave it, including federated rooms. This results in many (sometimes large) rooms without local members orphaned on the server, taking up database space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deleting messages (events) with attachments does not delete the attachment (because another message might refer to it?), which means that the sent files continue existing on the server indefinitely. Another privacy implication. A simple "delete all files older than X" script works great until it deletes avatars. So yeah, seems like this is something that should be handled by the Synapse server instead of cobbled-together scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even after extensive cleanup, PostgreSQL database might need to be vacuumed to reduce the disk space it takes up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Database grows out of control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even for my small server with &amp;lt;10 active users, database size reached several gigabytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synapse keeps track of room states in an append-only (!) table named state_groups_state. Deleting a room does not delete the state_groups_state records. So it is never automatically cleaned up, and grows in size infinitely. It is possible to delete many of those records from the database directly, and Element (the company) provides some tool to "compress" those records, but again, something that should be handled by the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good article about state_groups_state&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Users cannot be deleted&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is simply not an option in the API. Server admin can perform a "deactivate" (disable login) and "erase" (remove related data, which claims to be GDPR-compliant) on user accounts, but the accounts themselves stay on the server forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait, what? Why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How this not considered a GDPR violation is a mystery to me. Even on my tiny server, I have users who use their first name as their ID and bridged WhatsApp users that use phone numbers as IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Matrix-Element ecosystem has been catering towards government and corporate entities for some time, there have been multiple recent announcements about its future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, Element (the company) is now providing an all-in-one Element Server Suite (ESS) to replace the current setup, including&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;It is intended for non-professional use, evaluations, and small to mid-sized deployments (1â100 users).&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ESS Community includes 7 components/services, now requires a minimum of 2 CPUs, 2GB of RAM, and runs using... Kubernetes? IMO, this is an overkill for dozen users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For comparison, Snikket, an all-in-one solution with similar functionality using XMPP, requires a single CPU and 128MB (!) RAM for 10 or so users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, I have seen the ansible setup script setup recommended, but at this point, making setup easier does not address the issue of extra services being required in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matrix server setup using Ansible and Docker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, the ESS handles account creation and calls in an entirely different way, more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Matrix-WhatsApp bridge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty great. Easy to install and set up, works really well, and needs only occasional (semi-yearly or so) updates when WhatsApp changes their web API. Does not support calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Element Classic&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Same on all platforms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Element exists and looks consistent on Android, iOS, and web, making it easier for regular users and for troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No image captions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is silly, but while (official?) bridges support image captions, official Element app does not. The answer in the FAQ? Get a better app. Well, OK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No image caption in Element Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image with a caption in SchildiChat Classic (the better app).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Slow notifications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it can take up to a few minutes to get a message, even between two Android clients using Google Cloud Messaging. Sometimes it is nearly instant. Still unsure of the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No offline indication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One unreliable way to tell that the server is unreachable is the endless loading bar. But even then, it eventually goes away without indicating any errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, when sending a message, the user receives "Unable to send message". Frustration ensues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I know the app is trying to call the /sync endpoint. Why doesn't it show any errors when that fails?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Security key and device verification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IIRC the first thing the app does is ask user to back up their signing keys and enter the key password, without a simple explanation. Not a great experience for regular users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people reported issues with Element losing its keys or frequently requesting to be re-verified. Thankfully I have not encountered these.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Third-party services&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you connect to a self-hosted server, Element Classic could attempt to connect to vector.im integration server and matrix.org key backup server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Element X&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Element X is now recommended as the new and better client. It is not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Slower&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somehow, it is slower. Clicking on a conversation takes 0.5-1.0 seconds to load it, compared to almost instant load on Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it does work better for accounts with many large rooms, but that is not my case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sorting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversations are sorted by... who knows. It is not recent nor alphabetical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No background sync&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Element X does not support periodic background sync, so you need to set up ntfy or something similar to use Element X on a de-googled device. Seems like a simple enough fail-safe (even WhatsApp does this), but it was dropped for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Requires "sliding sync" option on the server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This "sliding sync" option is available only for newer Synapse versions, and only if running with PostgreSQL database (which should already be the case - see above). Probably not an issue unless the user tries to connect Element X to an outdated Synapse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Calls are not backward compatible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calling with Element X requires Element Call (part of ESS). This supports group calls, but... only video calls at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also might be asked to tell your contact to install the new app:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't regularly use calls, but some people I would like to invite to my server would want to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Onboarding is bad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I ended up either temporarily enabling unrestricted registration (a terrible idea), or creating my users' accounts manually, because the "invite" matrix.to link was broken, and registration tokens did not work correctly in mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let's see how it works now. Keep in mind, I am still on standalone Synapse, not ESS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Element X onboarding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a user, and I was to register an account on my friend's server. I see that Element X is now a recommended app, so let's try that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click "Create account" (which is a different style that does not look like a button for some reason).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I want an account on a different server. Click "Change account provider".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click "Other".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I can search for the server my friend is hosting, and it should appear in the list below the search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As server admin: I do not remember if Synapse server has to enable/keep federation for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! That is what I want, why is this so verbose?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WTF. So Element X cannot create even the simplest username+password account. That is all I want, I don't want to sign in with Google, Apple, or any other form of third-party authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Element Classic onboarding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was unable to register an account using Element X, so Element Classic should work better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, "CREATE ACCOUNT".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What difference does this make? Skip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current official app is telling me to use Element X. Just tried that. Click "EDIT" where it says "matrix.org" (which does not say "server", actually) and enter the server name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not? No explanation. Sure, I'll use a web client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, fuck me, I guess. Why can't I just create an account?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a server admin: Synapse is set to allow registrations via registration tokens, because unrestricted registration is a bad idea. I did not find where the /static/client/register path is set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IIRC it is possible to register an account by going to a web-hosted Element app, such as app.element.io, which will allow to register an account using a registration token. But then the user has to deal with the headache of cross-verifying their mobile device to the web app (which they might never use).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So now what?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matrix-Element is growing, building new features, and acquiring large customers (mostly government entities AFAIK). However, the new corporatesque ESS Community is not worth it in my opinion. I don't need fancy auth, third-party IDs, group video conferencing, or even federation for that matter. But it is clear that Synapse and Element X are severely crippled and are not designed to work without these services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will probably switch to Snikket, which is more efficient, has timely notifications, and very smooth onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who cares?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written by me, proof-read by an LLM. &lt;lb/&gt;Details at end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one of my talks on assembly, I show a list of the 20 most executed instructions on an average x86 Linux desktop. All the usual culprits are there, &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lea&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jmp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; and so on, but the surprise interloper is &lt;code&gt;xor&lt;/code&gt; - “eXclusive OR”. In my 6502 hacking days, the presence of an exclusive OR was a sure-fire indicator you’d either found the encryption part of the code, or some kind of sprite routine. It’s surprising then, that a Linux machine just minding its own business, would be executing so many.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is, until you remember that compilers love to emit a &lt;code&gt;xor&lt;/code&gt; when setting a register to zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that exclusive-OR-ing anything with itself generates zero, but why does the compiler emit this sequence? Is it just showing off?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the example above, I’ve compiled with &lt;code&gt;-O2&lt;/code&gt; and enabled Compiler Explorer’s “Compile to binary object” so you can view the machine code that the CPU sees, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;31 c0           xor eax, eax
c3              ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you change GCC’s optimisation level down to &lt;code&gt;-O1&lt;/code&gt; you’ll see:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;b8 00 00 00 00  mov eax, 0x0
c3              ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The much clearer, more intention-revealing &lt;code&gt;mov eax, 0&lt;/code&gt; to set the EAX register to zero takes up five bytes, compared to the two of the exclusive OR. By using a slightly more obscure instruction, we save three bytes every time we need to set a register to zero, which is a pretty common operation. Saving bytes makes the program smaller, and makes more efficient use of the instruction cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It gets better though! Since this is a very common operation, x86 CPUs spot this “zeroing idiom” early in the pipeline and can specifically optimise around it: the out-of-order tracking systems knows that the value of “eax” (or whichever register is being zeroed) does not depend on the previous value of eax, so it can allocate a fresh, dependency-free zero register renamer slot. And, having done that it removes the operation from the execution queue - that is the &lt;code&gt;xor&lt;/code&gt; takes zero execution cycles!1 It’s essentially optimised out by the CPU!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may wonder why you see &lt;code&gt;xor eax, eax&lt;/code&gt; but never &lt;code&gt;xor rax, rax&lt;/code&gt; (the 64-bit version), even when returning a &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, even though &lt;code&gt;rax&lt;/code&gt; is needed to hold the full 64-bit &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; result, by writing to &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt;, we get a nice effect: Unlike other partial register writes, when writing to an &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; register like &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt;, the architecture zeros the top 32 bits for free. So &lt;code&gt;xor eax, eax&lt;/code&gt; sets all 64 bits to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when zeroing the “extended” numbered registers (like &lt;code&gt;r8&lt;/code&gt;), GCC still uses the &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; (double width, ie 32-bit) variant:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note how it’s &lt;code&gt;xor r8d, r8d&lt;/code&gt; (the 32-bit variant) even though with the REX prefix (here &lt;code&gt;45&lt;/code&gt;) it would be the same number of bytes to &lt;code&gt;xor r8, r8&lt;/code&gt; the full width. Probably makes something easier in the compilers, as clang does this too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;xor eax, eax&lt;/code&gt; saves you code space and execution time! Thanks compilers!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This repair has been on the to do list for ages, so let’s finally get to it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my mind, Tektronix is a brand that makes electronics lab equipment like oscilloscopes and logic analyzers. Turns out, they made quite a few terminals and a couple of computers! A good friend saw this one for sale local to him, and I poked him till he agreed on picking it up for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picking it up may be the wrong wording, this thing is big and heavy! It weights about 35kg and it’s nearly a meter long!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s have a look at what this is, what I needed to do to repair it and what it can do!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some history&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The machine I got is a Tektronix 4051 graphics workstation, released in 1975, but let’s look a bit at the history from Tektronix before this was released. Tektronix started in late 1945 as Tekrad, but quickly got renamed to Tektronix. One of their first products was the 511 oscilloscope, the first oscilloscope with a trigger!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a good thing, and soon enough, Tektronix was synonymous with oscilloscopes and known as a company that made some of the best test and measurement equipment. In the 60s, mainframe and then minicomputers became more popular, which often needed a terminal. Tektronix at this point was making storage oscilloscopes, which use a storage CRT tube that can “remember” drawn signals. Using this technology, Tektronix released their first terminal in 1969, the 4002. A 11″ terminal that was capable of displaying graphics with a 400×300 pixel resolution. As the CRT rememebers the drawn data, there was no need for a RAM framebuffer!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years later in 1971 they released the 4010, again 11″ but now with 1024*780 pixel resolution. As they used Storage CRTs, these terminals where a lot cheaper then the competitors. Mind you, cheap still means around $4000, or around $30.000 in 2025 money. But the IBM 2250 was priced at around $280.000 That’s 1970s dollars, so well over 2 million USD today!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we move away from these terminals, one last cool tidbit. Tektronix made the 4010 in several sizes, the biggest being the 25″ 4016 with a 4096*3120 pixel resolution. 4K in 1974, sign me up!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The 405x computers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK I promised computers, so let’s move to the Tek 4051 I got! Released in 1975, this was based on the 4010 series of terminals, but with a Motorola 6800 computer inside. This machine ran, like so many at the time, BASIC, but with extra subroutines for drawing and manipulating vector graphics. 8KB RAM was standard, but up to 32KB RAM could be installed. Extra software was installed via ROM modules in the back, for example to add DSP routines. Data could be saved on tape, and via RS232 and GBIP external devices could be attached!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, a pretty capable machine, especially in 1975. BASIC computers where getting common, but graphics was pretty new. According to Tektronix the 4051 was ideal for researches, analysts and physicians, and this could be yours for the low low price of 6 grand, or around $36.000 in 2025. I could not find sales figures, but it seems that this was a decently successful machine. Tektronix also made the 4052, with a faster CPU, and the 4054, a 19″ 4K resolution behemoth! Tektronix continued making workstations until the 90s but like almost all workstations of the era, x86/Linux eventually took over the entire workstation market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 4051 was also used in a few series/movies, the storage CRTs do not flicker when recorded like a normal CRT and as they run basic, getting something cool on screen was fairly easy to do! The best known example was Battlestar Galactica:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fixing a Tektronix computer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the history out of the way, what’s the shape of the one I got?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was stored in a shed for a long while, state unknown, but it looked like it’s in OK shape. A bit dirty but who isn’t at times. Fuse is intact, and when opening it up, nothing looked “off” no bulging caps or such. But turning it on and nothing happens. Anticlimactic…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good bit of tracing wires later, it turned out the ON/OFF switch is broken. So to quicly remedy this, some wires can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do NOT recommend this. 230V via cheap breadboard wires is not smart. But with this, still nothing. Argh. So another bit of debugging later it turned out a wire of the mains transformer was not connected to the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s kind of visible in this photo, there are wires going from the transformer to the tabs to select voltages and one was broken. Luckily there was enough wire left to solder on and fix it, getting a replacement would have been impossible! After this fix, I got power! I disconnected as much as I could in order to check all the voltages I could check. We need 15V, 12V, 5V, -12, +20, -20 +185 and +365 and they turned out to all be in spec. Tektronix :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, time to slowly connect boards back in and see if something explodes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait I didn’t mean that as a suggestion… Sadly this resistor didn’t understand sarcasm and decided to go up in smoke. It’s a 47 ohm resistor that limits a 320V supply a bit. Perhaps it got a little too warm, or age got the better of it. I did check everything after the resistor and all measured OK. No transistor in a short or capacitor that imploded. So let’s just replace this and pray?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neat, that worked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calibrating that display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something appeared on the display, which is a BIG improvement, and it all looks like the machine wants to boot. But the display is completely unreadable, which means it’s time to calibrate all voltages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which means, measure a power supply that’s almost 4KV. Spicy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luckily I have a HV scope probe on loan from a friend! And the HV is in spec. So that’s good, but all the other voltages are not. These CRTs are pretty sensitive to all the needed voltages, sensitive enough that they are calibrated in the factory and the voltages for the exact CRT are written on them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;196V and 75V for this one, and I measured 160V and 55V. yeah that’ll do it! Quite a few calibration steps later the display turned out to be quite nicely readable and in great condition!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The single tape I got with mine is sadly broken. The belt snapped, which seems to be a common issue with these. The drive itself seems to work, and the tape I got is an OS backup tape, so likely nothing too important. This is fixable, but not too high on my to-do list for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a less complex repair then expected. Some keyboard switches are a bit crusty, it needs a clean, but a 50 year old computer mostly just working is pretty amazing! So let’s end this repair on a few fun beauty shots of the inside and more:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What did I pick up exactly?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having a look at my machine, it has maxed out RAM at 32KB, sadly no serial port, but it did came with a ROM Expander!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The back of the 4051 has space for 2 ROM cards. These contain things like extra programs, subroutines for DSP algorithms and more. These can contain 8KB of ROM, and are memory mapped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want more then 2 at any time, the Rom Expander allows you to have 8! Only one is memory mapped at any time, but the OS of the 4051 scans all ROMS on start, and when you run a program on a ROM, it makes sure to send a few commands to the expander to memory map the right one. This is all invisible as an end user and the machine acts like having 8 ROMs, or if you have 2 expanders, 16 ROMs!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got 3 ROMs with mine, one for an editor program, one to load/store binary data to tape, and one for the optional external floppy drive. Oh, yes, there is a floppy drive! Sadly I don’t have it, but if someone has one collecting dust, do let me know :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;But can it run DOOM?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OK any games at all?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How about some monopoly!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the display technique, most games don’t work very well. The display can’t easily be cleared, apart from a full erase of the display. So some games like tic tac toe or monopoly work but anything more active is difficult sadly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luckily there are plenty of cool demo’s and programs for the 4051 and it’s bigger siblings. A TON of programs, manuals and more can be found on the Github page from Monty McGraw. There is also an emulator so you can try this all out using any modern computer!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the projects on Monty’s Github is a GBIP flash emulator. Currently my 4051 has no way to load/store programs, and typing a 1000 line BASIC file is a bit of a pain. So I’m definitely ordering parts for that!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also quite a few ROM cards I do not have, so I am working on a ROM board to clone them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally having this beautiful machine up and running is a great step, and I’ll leave it at this for now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, if you enjoyed this blog post, you can buy me a coffee!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Penicillin Myth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Competing theories seek to explain inconsistencies surrounding Alexander Fleming’s famed discovery.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I did not invent penicillin. Nature did that. I only discovered it by accident.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;—Alexander Fleming&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many know the story of Alexander Fleming’s chance discovery of penicillin. Fleming, a bit of an absent-minded professor (and a bit of a slob), left culture plates streaked with Staphylococcus on his lab bench while he went away on summer holiday. When he returned, he found that “a mould” had contaminated one of his plates, probably having floated in from an open window. Before discarding the plate, he noticed that, within a “ring of death” around the mold, the bacteria had disappeared. Something in the “mould juice” had killed the staphylococci.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming immediately began investigating this strange new substance. He identified the mold as Penicillium rubrum and named the substance penicillin.1 He published his findings in the spring of 1929 in The British Journal of Experimental Pathology.2 But a decade later, pharmacologist Howard Florey and biochemist Ernst Chain at Oxford would pick up where Fleming left off. Alongside a USDA lab in Peoria, Illinois, the pair would develop penicillin into a life-saving drug and usher in the era of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the kind of science story everyone likes. One of serendipity and accidental discovery; a chance observation that changed the world. But is it true?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists and historians have puzzled over inconsistencies in Fleming’s story. For starters, the window to Fleming’s lab was rarely (if ever) left open, precisely to prevent the kind of contamination that supposedly led to penicillin’s discovery. Second, the story is strikingly similar to Fleming’s earlier discovery of lysozyme, another antibacterial substance, which also featured lucky contamination from an open window. Third, Fleming claimed to have discovered the historic culture plate on September 3rd, but the first entry in his lab notebook isn’t dated until October 30th, nearly two months later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last, and most important: penicillin only works if it’s present before the staphylococci. Fleming did not know it at the time, but penicillin interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis, which only happens when bacteria are actively growing. Visible colonies, however, are composed mostly of mature or dead cells. By the time a colony can be seen, it is often too late for penicillin to have any effect. In fact, the Penicillium mold typically won’t even grow on a plate already filled with staphylococcus colonies. For years, scientists have attempted to replicate Fleming’s original discovery. All have met with failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, it’s difficult to reconcile Fleming’s story with these historical and scientific discrepancies. Did he misremember events from 15 years earlier? Could he have fudged the details to make for a more compelling narrative? Or, might Fleming’s experiment have been subject to an unusual confluence of chance events unbeknownst even to him?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speculation about how Fleming discovered penicillin is of little consequence compared to its practical impact. However, science is about evaluating evidence and moving closer to the “truth.” As we near the 100th anniversary of penicillin’s discovery — which undoubtedly will encourage even greater repetition of the story — it’s in this spirit that we must scrutinize the story’s veracity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The historical and scientific data are limited and often contradictory. Nevertheless, several scientists and historians have worked hard to piece together what facts are certain and fill the gaps with their most probable guesses. The result is a range of competing theories, each attempting to explain what really happened in that St. Mary’s Hospital laboratory in the summer of 1928.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fleming’s Account&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin is primarily based on this passage from his 1929 paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While working with staphylococcus variants a number of culture-plates were set aside on the laboratory bench and examined from time to time. In the examinations these plates were necessarily exposed to the air and they became contaminated with various micro-organisms. It was noticed that around a large colony of a contaminating mould the staphylococcus colonies became transparent and were obviously undergoing lysis (see Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fig. 1” refers to a “Photograph of a culture-plate.” It shows separate, well-grown staphylococcus colonies around 2-4 mm in diameter spread across most of the plate’s surface. But on one edge, a large mold colony of about 20 mm in diameter, plus a secondary satellite colony, is clearly visible. This is labeled “Penicillium colony.” Surrounding it is a zone of about 20 mm in which the staphylococcus colonies are either not visible or have become semi-transparent ghosts. Those nearest to the mold are smaller than the rest, only 0.4 to 0.8 mm, while those towards the periphery are a bit larger, 0.8 to 1.7 mm. Fleming has labeled these “Staphylococci undergoing lysis.” Later, Fleming and his colleagues would claim that this was the original contaminated plate from which Penicillium was first isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On its face, this seems simple enough. Everyone knows that penicillin destroys bacteria, and Fleming observed staphylococci seemingly being destroyed by a mold that produced penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, upon closer reading of Fleming’s 1929 paper, it becomes clear that a great deal of work was either omitted or inadequately described. There is, for example, no description of the type of culture medium used; whether or not the plate had been incubated; how long it had been on the bench; and, most important of all, what species of Staphylococcus was being studied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When publishing a scientific paper, scientists are expected to include a detailed description of their methods alongside their results. Like a recipe, these methods should clearly and comprehensively describe the materials used and the steps taken so that other scientists can replicate the experiment. And while incomplete or poorly-described methods are a perennial problem, the omission of these key experimental details (even in a report on an accidental discovery) is surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This became a problem when, as interest in penicillin grew, other investigators tried to repeat Fleming’s discovery. In 1944, Margaret Jennings (who later married a long-time colleague and penicillin researcher, Howard Florey) spread purified penicillin onto plates of fully grown staphylococci. This should have had a more potent effect than Fleming’s pictured in Figure 1, which was allegedly produced only with the crude “mould juice” from an accidental contaminant. Jennings, however, observed no visible change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1965, the pathologist W.D. Foster attempted a similar experiment using penicillin crystals dropped directly onto staphylococcus colonies, creating “astronomical” concentrations within their vicinity. But still, the colonies remained unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other attempts at replication called into question whether the mold could have even grown on a plate full of staphylococci. Pharmacologist D.B. Colquhoun claimed that, in 1955, he found that Penicillium mold refused to grow on a plate already full of staphylococcus colonies. Or, that, if it did, it produced no visible effect on the colonies. He could, however, see an effect if the sequence of events was reversed: if the mold was allowed to grow for several days first, and the staphylococci was later inoculated onto the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although these failures are hard to reconcile with Fleming’s account, they are in line with what we now know about the biology of penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1940, the physician A.D. Gardner, researching alongside Florey, peered into his microscope to examine how penicillin affected individual bacterial cells. Surprisingly, adult cells seemed to be largely unaffected; however, when they divided, the young cells grew “as immense swollen filaments.” Like party balloons, they elongated and expanded, then popped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The morphological changes,” observed bacteriologist J.P. Duguid in 1946, “suggest that penicillin in these concentrations interferes specifically with the formation of the outer supporting cell wall, while otherwise allowing growth to proceed until the organism finally bursts its defective envelope and so undergoes lysis.” At the time, this was largely speculation. Not much was known about the biology of bacterial cell walls. But after a decade of study — motivated in no small part by a desire to understand how penicillin worked — this hypothesis has largely been proven correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bacterial cell wall is a rigid, mesh-like structure composed primarily of peptidoglycan, a large macromolecule consisting of small subunits cross-linked by specialized enzymes called transpeptidases. The job of the cell wall is to maintain the cell’s shape and keep it from absorbing too much water. If the outward pressure from the cell’s contents becomes too great for the delicate cell membrane to contain, it bursts, spilling the cell’s innards. The cell wall, like a heavy-duty bicycle tire around a rubber inner tube, helps to resist this pressure, protecting the cell from mechanical stresses both inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike a bike tire, however, cell walls need to be able to grow with the cells they enclose. To accommodate increasing cell size, bacteria are continuously breaking and rebuilding the peptidoglycan mesh. This is where penicillin comes in. Because penicillin has a similar chemical structure to a peptidoglycan subunit, it can bind to the transpeptidases that complete the final step in cell wall biosynthesis.3 When this happens, penicillin forms a covalent bond in the transpeptidase’s active site, irreversibly inactivating the enzyme. As it grows, the cell continues to disassemble its cell wall, but without the use of its transpeptidases, it can no longer rebuild it. Over time, the cell wall weakens and eventually bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This explains why Jennings and others couldn’t replicate Fleming’s contaminated plate. A mature colony is mostly composed of adult or dead cells. These cells are unaffected by penicillin because they aren’t actively growing, and so aren’t actively breaking and rebuilding their cell wall. As a result, penicillin doesn’t cause mature cells to lyse, and the colony’s overall appearance doesn’t change. But if the penicillin is present before the staphylococci, it prevents the bacteria from growing and dividing, or they do so much more slowly. When that happens, they don’t form visible colonies. Thus, penicillin does not dissolve fully grown colonies, as Fleming had initially assumed, but inhibits their growth from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difficulty replicating Fleming’s discovery is frustrated by the ease with which it’s possible to “rediscover” penicillin by reversing the order of growth. By first growing Penicillium mold until it becomes a large colony, then seeding the plate with staphylococci, the result is indistinguishable from Fleming’s original plate. However, no trained scientist would intentionally use a culture plate visibly contaminated with a large mold — and certainly not an expert bacteriologist like Fleming.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no contemporary records to corroborate the story that Fleming discovered the contaminated culture plate when he returned from holiday on September 3rd: no lab notebook records, calendar notes, diary entries, or any letters. In the 1929 paper, the figure is simply labeled, “Photograph of a culture-plate.” The only evidence we have stems from recollections by Fleming and colleagues years later, after penicillin was recognized as a runaway clinical success. Fleming himself described the Figure 1 plate as the “original culture plate” in a 1944 paper. Yet, he also included the disclaimer that “after a lapse of fifteen years it is very difficult to say just what processes of thought were involved.”5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The earliest recorded mention of the mold and penicillin is an experiment written in Fleming’s lab notebook dated October 30th, 1928 — nearly two months after he purportedly found the culture plate. Curiously, it does not describe the chance discovery of a contaminant, but a carefully constructed experiment that suggests Fleming had already spent some time isolating and characterizing the mold. In it, Fleming used the reversed-sequence culturing method: first, placing a mold spore on the plate and letting it grow into a large, penicillin-producing colony, then inoculating several pathogenic species of bacteria, including staphylococci, near the mold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On October 30th, Fleming recorded the results: the mold affected a whole host of pathogens, including staphylococci, which could not grow near the mold. It’s a fine experiment, but it’s clearly not the discovery of an accidentally contaminated culture plate. This raises the question: What was Fleming doing for the previous two months, and if he was working with penicillin, why didn’t he bother recording any of it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, these scientific inconsistencies and experimental failures have haunted the story of penicillin’s discovery. Amidst the incontrovertible Nobel Prize-winning scientific and clinical success of penicillin — and without a plausible alternative — the doubters kept quiet. At least, most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ronald Hare’s Theory (1970)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1964, the bacteriologist Ronald Hare took up the puzzle of penicillin’s origins. After examining old lab notebooks and conducting experiments of his own, he would conclude that “the history of both the culture plate and the mould itself must have been very different from what had previously been thought to be the case.” Hare published his own theory on penicillin’s discovery in his 1970 book, The Birth of Penicillin, and the Disarming of Microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare was uniquely positioned to investigate this mystery. Not only was he an accomplished bacteriologist and expert on penicillin, having spent 20 years as a Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London, and the ten years before that at the University of Toronto, where he was largely responsible for planning and building the Canadian Government’s penicillin plant; he started his career in the same department as Fleming at St. Mary’s. In fact, he claims to have been in the laboratory the very day Fleming discovered the now-famous culture plate. (Despite this close professional association, however, Hare claims to have played no part in the discovery or original research on penicillin nor to have discussed them with Fleming.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although that discovery is now regarded as one of the most significant scientific events of the 20th century, Hare admits that, at the time, it made little to no impression on him or any of his colleagues. “The rest of us, being engaged in researches that seemed far more important than a contaminated culture plate, merely glanced at it, thought that it was no more than another wonder that Fleming seemed to be forever unearthing, and promptly forgot all about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, Hare had been skeptical from the start that penicillin could have been discovered by simple contamination of a culture plate. It was such a common occurrence in biology laboratories that “if this had been the sequence of events, penicillin would probably have been discovered while Fleming was still a child.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After retirement, Hare took up the penicillin question. He began by attempting to replicate Fleming’s discovery. He seeded an ordinary culture plate with staphylococci, incubated it until colonies were visible, then placed a few mold spores on the surface. As the microbiologists before him had observed, the mold refused to grow. He tried coaxing the mold’s growth by plating it further and further away from any staphylococcal colonies (without deviating too far from the overall appearance of Fleming’s Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this approach, he was finally able to get the mold to grow and produce penicillin, but still the staphylococcal colonies were unaffected. “No one looking at such a plate could possibly guess that a powerful antibacterial substance was emanating from the mould.” If, however, he reversed the order and plated the mold before the staphylococci, he could get a result “almost indistinguishable from that of Fleming’s original plate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vexed, Hare reevaluated the evidence. He had shown the mold couldn’t have contaminated the plate after the staphylococci because the mold wouldn’t grow (or, if it did, the penicillin wouldn’t affect the staphylococcus colonies). He assumed that the contamination couldn’t have occurred before the staphylococci (though that reliably recreates the plate pictured) because no bacteriologist would knowingly use a contaminated plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if the mold contaminated the plate at the same time, or within a few hours, of when it was seeded with staphylococci? And what if the staphylococci’s growth had been paused (somehow) until the mold colony had matured? To Fleming’s eyes, he would have assumed he had inoculated staphylococci onto a contamination-free culture plate. Yet, with the staphylococci’s growth delayed, the mold would have had time to fully develop into a large, penicillin-producing colony. When the staphylococci’s growth was restarted, it would be growing in effectively the same conditions as if it had been plated after the mold had grown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare knew just the thing that could arrest the staphylococci’s growth: low temperature. Staphylococci grow most rapidly at 98.6 °F (37 °C). As a human pathogen, it has evolved to grow optimally at human body temperature. This is why microbiologists incubate culture plates: to speed up their growth into visible colonies. The lowest temperature at which any staphylococci growth occurs, and then only very slowly, is around 53 °F (12 °C). The Penicillium mold, on the other hand, prefers to grow around 77 °F (25 °C) but is not greatly affected by temperature ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It therefore seemed possible that penicillin could have been discovered as described in the original 1929 paper, but with the addition a few details Fleming was unaware of: first, the inoculation of staphylococci and contamination by mold occurred at the same time; second, Fleming forgot6 to incubate the plate; and third, the lab’s room temperature was low enough for long enough for the mold to grow and produce penicillin before the staphylococci began to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test this theory, Hare simultaneously inoculated a culture plate with both staphylococci and Fleming’s mold and left it on his benchtop. The weather that day was cold, wet, and stormy, and the temperature was relatively low: 61 to 65 °F (16.1 to 18.3 °C). As expected, the staphylococci grew more slowly than they would have in an incubator, and only tiny transparent colonies were visible on the third day. The mold, however, grew much more prolifically, and a tiny colony was visible after just 48 hours, growing to 10 mm by the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of the fifth day, Hare had rediscovered penicillin. The result was practically indistinguishable from the photo in Fleming’s original paper: in a ten millimeter zone around the mold, the staphylococcus colonies were small and transparent, while those outside the zone were larger and opaque. Many experiments later, Hare found that penicillin could reliably be rediscovered in this manner so long as the temperature was kept below 68 °F (20 °C) for four or five days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where Hare the scientist had to become Hare the historian. Was the temperature in Fleming’s laboratory low enough for him to discover penicillin at the end of July or the beginning of August in accordance with the timeline of his canonical story?7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare searched the records at the Meteorological Office for the maximum and minimum shade temperatures from the beginning of July to the end of September, 1928. In the weeks before Fleming left on holiday there was a heatwave; from July 10th to 27th, there were highs in the upper 70s and 80s. At these temperatures, the staphylococci would have grown too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, on the 28th, the heatwave ended and was quickly replaced by a cold snap. For the next nine days, the maximum temperature only exceeded 68 °F on two occasions, and not by much. It was a slim window, in which the temperature in Fleming’s laboratory would have been low enough. But it coincided perfectly with Fleming’s holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare’s theory relies on a triple chance of unlikely events. First, the penicillin-producing Penicillium mold landed on Fleming’s culture plate; second, Fleming failed to incubate the plate; and third, the temperature was low enough for the five days required to favor mold growth.8 “Had only one link in this chain been broken,” Hare writes. “Fleming would have missed his opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare himself concedes that the combination of these contingencies seems exceptionally unlikely. The original story of chance discovery, on its own, was one of serendipity and good fortune. His theory required an additional layer of meteorological luck on top of chance contamination. “Far from the phenomenon that led to the discovery being a comparatively common event that had previously escaped detection, it must be so unusual an occurrence that it is doubtful whether it can have happened very often since bacteria were first cultivated in the laboratory.” Yet, however improbable it may seem, to quote Sherlock Holmes: “When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Robert Root-Bernstein’s Theory (1989)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare’s theory is based on the assumption that the Figure 1 plate was indeed the source of the original contamination. It also overlooks the two-month gap between when Fleming allegedly noticed the contaminated plate and recorded the first penicillin experiment. These details, however, form the foundation of a competing theory on penicillin’s origins — that belonging to Robert Root-Bernstein, Professor of Physiology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein described his theory in his 1989 book, Discovering: Inventing and Solving Problems at the Frontiers of Science.9 It’s an ambitious and unorthodox book, structured as a seminar between six characters discussing creativity and the scientific process. Each character represents various points of view on the sciences and scientists and, along the way, they also discuss the important chronological and methodological idiosyncrasies of Fleming’s discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein’s theory is argued and defended by the character Imp (real name Ernest; apparently a stand-in for the author himself). After summarizing the key details of Hare’s theory, Imp focuses on the two-month gap. Fleming supposedly discovered the Fig. 1 contaminated plate when he returned from a holiday on September 3rd, but the first lab notebook entry about Penicillium and penicillin wasn’t written until October 30th. As described earlier, that entry does not record the discovery of a contaminated plate but a planned experiment in which the Penicillium mold was first isolated and tested against several bacteria, including staphylococci.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why, Imp wonders, if Fleming already had that beautiful culture plate which so perfectly illustrated the staphylococci-killing power of penicillin, he would wait two months to record the finding? And why do so in the context of another experiment? Furthermore, this plate still exists within the British Museum. That means Fleming had to fix it with formaldehyde relatively soon after he found it. But if he thought the plate was important enough to preserve, why didn’t he note its discovery at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t in Fleming’s character to procrastinate. According to his research scholar, Merlyn Pryce: “[Fleming] didn’t confine himself to observing, but took action at once. Lots of people observe a phenomenon, feeling that it may be important, but they don’t get beyond being surprised — after which, they forget. That was never the case with Fleming.” So then, what was he doing for two months?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s in this context that Imp (Root-Bernstein) grounds his belief that Fleming’s discovery wasn’t the serendipitous chance of lore — at least, not completely. Instead, he proposes that Fleming wasn’t running a staphylococcus experiment when he discovered penicillin; he was looking for new sources of lysozyme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming had a long-standing professional interest in antibacterial substances. His most important discovery before penicillin was the lysozymes, enzymes found in various bodily fluids (e.g., tears, saliva, and egg whites) that break down the cell walls of bacteria. He had also studied the antibacterial properties of mercuric chloride and bacteriophages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 1922 and 1928, Fleming’s team tested anything they could get their hands on: human mucus, tears, sputum, and blood; the eggs of dozens of fish and bird species; tears collected from horses, cows, hens, ducks, geese, and fifty other species from the London Zoo; earthworm and snail slime; large numbers of vegetables and flowers. They continued to publish on lysozymes into the 1930s. “Is it too much to suggest,” Imp asked, “that he also examined any fungus that happened to come his way?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we assume that Fleming was engaged in a systematic search for new sources of lysozyme, we can now reasonably fill in the gap between September 3rd, when he first spots the mold, and October 30th, when he first records the Penicillium experiment. Root-Bernstein’s theory about the discovery goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Fleming begins by finding the mold, which may or may not have been on a staphylococcus plate. In the paper, Fleming only says that he found it at the time he was “working with staphylococcus variants.” Either way, the plate is not enough to incite a “Eureka!” moment, as the canonical version of the story suggests.10 Instead, like the hundreds of other unusual samples he’s tested, Fleming transfers the mold to a new culture plate, gives it a few days to establish itself, and then runs a routine experiment to test for lysozyme activity. He finds that it weakly affects a lysozyme-sensitive strain. Not terribly interesting — not even worth recording11 — but it warrants a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A short time later, the Root-Bernstein theory goes, Fleming prepares a second experiment. After growing the mold for five days into a robust colony, he adds various lysozyme-sensitive and -resistant species to the plate, including Staphylococcus. This time, he records the results because (surprise!) the mold affects the lysozyme-resistant staphylococci. This experiment, whose results are recorded on October 30th, is exactly what it appears to be within the context of Fleming’s notebooks: “the first penicillin experiment — the first recognition by Fleming that he’s dealing with something unexpected and exciting!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, if this is the true sequence of events, why didn’t Fleming record it as such in his 1929 paper? “The logic of presentation rarely corresponds to the logic of discovery,” said Imp. Few scientists actually document the chronological sequence of events that led to their discovery. “Just imagine for a moment trying to write into a research paper the account I’ve just given,” said Imp:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While looking essentially randomly for organisms producing lysozyme, a common but unidentified mold was isolated from the air of the laboratory. Initial experiments showed that the mold appeared to have lysozyme activity, so controls were set up, including staphylococci, which I just happened to have been working on at the time. Much to my surprise, the mold had unexpected properties, so I was now forced to further characterize and identify the mold …This subsequent research conclusively demonstrated that the product of the mold was not lysozyme, but rather a new substance having the following characteristics …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s too circuitous and indirect for a scientific report. Better, instead, to start with the mold lysing the pathogen, because that was the important and novel observation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under this theory of events, the Figure 1 plate also becomes exactly what it appears to be in its proper context: an illustrative example of the fact that penicillin-secreting Penicillium can kill staphylococci. Not, as the story is typically told, the original contaminated plate. Reading further in the paper, similar examples are included as Figures 3 and 4, which illustrate other properties of penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming still could have shown his colleagues a contaminated staphylococcus plate on September 3rd, but one which must not have had the telltale “ring of death.” Or perhaps he did pass around the plate that would become the famous Figure 1, but not until several months later, when he was preparing figures for his paper. Hare’s cold snap, too, may have played a role in the mold growing when it did, but it no longer has to coincide with Fleming inoculating his staphylococcus plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Fleming was originally searching for new sources of lysozyme could also explain why he thought the mold contaminated a staphylococcus plate after the colonies had fully grown (which, barring Hare’s theory of simultaneous contamination, should be impossible). Penicillin may not be able to lyse mature colonies, but lysozymes can. Fleming may have assumed penicillin lyses bacteria the same way as lysozymes, and therefore could lyse mature colonies. It’s a conceptual leap, but one made smaller if he was looking for lysozymes in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Hare, Root-Bernstein does not claim his account of Fleming’s discovery is “true,” only that it’s compatible with available data. (Root-Bernstein does not, however, shy away from claiming that his theory is the more likely of the two. “Hare may be a good bacteriologist,” said Imp, “but I question his historical acumen. Dates — you’ve got to pay attention to dates.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More important to Root-Bernstein than the specifics of Fleming’s discovery is the fact that it evidences Pasteur’s principle that “chance favors only the prepared mind.” Whether he was experimenting with staphylococci or lysozyme, Fleming kept his mind open to the possibility of discovering new bacteriolytic substances. He often gave the advice, “Never neglect an extraordinary appearance or happening. It may be — usually is, in fact — a false alarm that leads to nothing, but may on the other hand be the clue provided by fate to lead you to some important advance.”12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming’s methods — which included testing strange samples and keeping plates around for longer than he needed them — increased the probability that he would stumble upon something new, and he was mentally prepared to recognize them when he did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Source of the Mold&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other important aspect of Fleming’s discovery is the source of the contaminating mold. According to the canonical version of the story, the Penicillium floated into Fleming’s lab from an open window. However, no such claim was made in the 1929 paper. In fact, nothing about its source was said until 1945 when Fleming told the writer George Lacken that it had blown through the window from Praed Street.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Fleming would say this is a mystery. He had no evidence that was the case, and as Hare writes, opening a laboratory window is “thoroughly bad bacteriology.” Further, Fleming’s windowsill was often piled high with test tubes and beakers filled with pathogenic bacteria. It would have created quite a scandal should any of these have fallen out of an open window onto the heads of the vulnerable passersby below. Nevertheless, the story gained wide publicity after André Maurois repeated it in his 1959 biography, The Life of Sir Alexander Fleming. Maurois repeatedly referred to “the mysterious mould from Praed Street,” and “the spore carried by the wind.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming himself seemed unsure of its origins. In a 1946 speech at the Mayo Clinic, he claimed ignorance of its source, “a mould spore coming from I don’t know where, dropped on the plate.” But in another speech in Edinburgh that same year, he claimed, “penicillium had dropped through the window.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Hare’s account, the Penicillium came not from the window but the stairwell. In Hare’s 1970 book, he notes how immediately below Fleming’s laboratory, in the same turret of the building, was a mycology lab run by C.J. La Touche. La Touche studied how molds can trigger asthma. He spent much of his time swabbing carpets and curtains in homes inhabited by asthma patients and growing strange and uncommon species of mold from these samples. In the process, he had acquired quite a large collection. But, as Hare recalls from his time working in the same building, La Touche’s lab wasn’t equipped with the fume cupboards or hoods that most mycologists used to prevent mold spores from contaminating the air. As a result, the air in La Touche’s was liable to be full of floating spores, waiting to be carried wherever the breeze might take them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both La Touche and Fleming’s labs had doors that opened to a shared stairwell. It is therefore likely that the spore that contaminated Fleming’s plate had originated in La Touche’s laboratory, having traveled out the door of La Touche’s lab, up the stairs, and into Fleming’s. Yet even if none of La Touche’s spores took this journey, at the very least, La Touche himself did: Fleming cites La Touche as the mycologist who identified the mold as Penicillium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Theories, Plausible and Implausible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we approach the 100th anniversary of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin, no definitive answer to this mystery has emerged. Other scientists have proposed a handful of additional theories,13 some of which rely on events even less likely than Hare’s, but Hare and Root-Bernstein’s seem to be rooted in the most solid evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, I believe Root-Bernstein’s theory. Hare’s is scientifically possible, but it relies on an exceptionally improbable sequence of events requiring luck on the order of picking the correct Powerball numbers three (or more) times in a row. Root-Bernstein’s is simpler and more in tune with the psychology and habits of working scientists. It only requires accepting that Fleming and his colleagues misremembered the identity of an unrecorded and, admittedly, forgettable culture plate from 15 years earlier — which seems entirely plausible. Occam’s razor suggests the simplest explanation is usually the best one, and that is Root-Bernstein’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin is not just an interesting historical anecdote; it’s held up as a prime example of momentous inventions discovered by accident. It looms large among discussions about the nature of discovery and how to encourage it. But if Root-Bernstein’s theory is true, and Fleming actually found penicillin while searching for new lysozymes instead of while doing an unrelated staphylococcus experiment, can it really be called an accident?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, penicillin isn’t lysozyme, and a deliberate search for one thing that results in finding something else can still be deemed accidental. Yet, finding a new kind of bacteriolytic substance while looking for a different kind of bacteriolytic substance seems, at least, to be one of a lesser order. Fleming may have been fishing for lysozyme, but his methods — testing strange contaminants for the ability to lyse other microbes — formed a net that, sooner or later, was bound to catch something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein’s theory thus turns penicillin from an example of an “accidental discovery” into one that reflects what the computational biologists Itai Yanai and Martin Lercher have described as an “evolutionary process” in scientific research. In this conception, research isn’t a linear march, but an evolutionary tree, full of once-promising branches that proved fruitless and unexpected offshoots that led to new discoveries. Such an evolutionary history, they argue, “is generally obscured in the resulting scientific publication,” which favors neat teleology. &lt;lb/&gt;Fleming’s 1929 penicillin paper may have been written as a linear process, but that’s almost certainly not how the discovery occurred. And by eliminating these complicated twists and turns, Fleming inadvertently obscured what may be one of the most important lessons in scientific history: how combining a meticulous research program with the openness to branch out into new directions led him to Nobel Prize-winning success. Neither rigid plans nor the winds of chance are enough on their own; discovery requires both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, whatever sequence of events actually occurred, what mattered was that Fleming was primed to make the key observation when chance presented it and jumped on what he saw. The rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reasons why Fleming did not pursue penicillin research further has been attributed to a multiple technical, institutional, and personal reasons, the history of which could be an essay in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of how they were discovered, transpeptidases were originally named “penicillin binding proteins” (PBPs). However, binding to penicillin is not their normal function, to my great confusion as a microbiology undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1927, Fleming was the “obvious choice” to write the chapter on staphylococci in the large nine-volume System of Bacteriology. This was generally referred to as “the Bible” in bacteriology labs because it was supposed to contain the whole of existing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Casting further doubt, Fleming stated in that same paper, that “what had originally been a well-grown staphylococcal colony was now a faint shadow of its former self,” but we now know that is not possible. Fleming’s colleagues have also claimed that was the plate Fleming showed them in September. Yet, here again, no records verify this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not incubating the plate may have been done intentionally. Fleming was known to make “agar art,” pictures on culture plates done by “painting” with colorful bacteria. Though incubation is standard practice because it grows bacteria quickly, it can affect how vivid the colors of the colonies appear. Some suspect Fleming may have deliberately failed to incubate his staphylococci just to see what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was before climate control systems and LEED-certified buildings. Though a gas fire kept Fleming’s laboratory warm in the winter, for the rest of the year the temperature could fluctuate violently from the heat of the sun and cold winds from the east and south.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, four unlikely events combine. Fleming later claimed that he had already discarded the plate onto a pile in a Lysol bath, and it was only later, while talking with his research scholar, Merlyn Pryce, that he noticed the historic plate, high and dry, and rescued it. Had the pile been cleared away a little sooner, or the antiseptic bath filled a little deeper, then that one-in-a-million plate would have been lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was made aware of Root-Bernstein’s theory, and in turn the entire alternate universe of penicillin theories, by William Rosen’s 2018 book, Miracle Cure: The Creation of Antibiotics and the Birth of Modern Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, it has been claimed that, instead of “Eureka!” Fleming muttered the more modest, “that’s funny…”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Hare writes, “what mattered most to Fleming was not the recording of his experiments but his performance.” The absence of lab notebook entries, therefore, is not necessarily evidence that he didn’t run any experiments between September 3rd and October 30th. It could just as well have been that none were interesting enough to be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Penicillin Myth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Competing theories seek to explain inconsistencies surrounding Alexander Fleming’s famed discovery.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I did not invent penicillin. Nature did that. I only discovered it by accident.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;—Alexander Fleming&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many know the story of Alexander Fleming’s chance discovery of penicillin. Fleming, a bit of an absent-minded professor (and a bit of a slob), left culture plates streaked with Staphylococcus on his lab bench while he went away on summer holiday. When he returned, he found that “a mould” had contaminated one of his plates, probably having floated in from an open window. Before discarding the plate, he noticed that, within a “ring of death” around the mold, the bacteria had disappeared. Something in the “mould juice” had killed the staphylococci.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming immediately began investigating this strange new substance. He identified the mold as Penicillium rubrum and named the substance penicillin.1 He published his findings in the spring of 1929 in The British Journal of Experimental Pathology.2 But a decade later, pharmacologist Howard Florey and biochemist Ernst Chain at Oxford would pick up where Fleming left off. Alongside a USDA lab in Peoria, Illinois, the pair would develop penicillin into a life-saving drug and usher in the era of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the kind of science story everyone likes. One of serendipity and accidental discovery; a chance observation that changed the world. But is it true?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists and historians have puzzled over inconsistencies in Fleming’s story. For starters, the window to Fleming’s lab was rarely (if ever) left open, precisely to prevent the kind of contamination that supposedly led to penicillin’s discovery. Second, the story is strikingly similar to Fleming’s earlier discovery of lysozyme, another antibacterial substance, which also featured lucky contamination from an open window. Third, Fleming claimed to have discovered the historic culture plate on September 3rd, but the first entry in his lab notebook isn’t dated until October 30th, nearly two months later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last, and most important: penicillin only works if it’s present before the staphylococci. Fleming did not know it at the time, but penicillin interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis, which only happens when bacteria are actively growing. Visible colonies, however, are composed mostly of mature or dead cells. By the time a colony can be seen, it is often too late for penicillin to have any effect. In fact, the Penicillium mold typically won’t even grow on a plate already filled with staphylococcus colonies. For years, scientists have attempted to replicate Fleming’s original discovery. All have met with failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, it’s difficult to reconcile Fleming’s story with these historical and scientific discrepancies. Did he misremember events from 15 years earlier? Could he have fudged the details to make for a more compelling narrative? Or, might Fleming’s experiment have been subject to an unusual confluence of chance events unbeknownst even to him?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speculation about how Fleming discovered penicillin is of little consequence compared to its practical impact. However, science is about evaluating evidence and moving closer to the “truth.” As we near the 100th anniversary of penicillin’s discovery — which undoubtedly will encourage even greater repetition of the story — it’s in this spirit that we must scrutinize the story’s veracity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The historical and scientific data are limited and often contradictory. Nevertheless, several scientists and historians have worked hard to piece together what facts are certain and fill the gaps with their most probable guesses. The result is a range of competing theories, each attempting to explain what really happened in that St. Mary’s Hospital laboratory in the summer of 1928.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fleming’s Account&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin is primarily based on this passage from his 1929 paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While working with staphylococcus variants a number of culture-plates were set aside on the laboratory bench and examined from time to time. In the examinations these plates were necessarily exposed to the air and they became contaminated with various micro-organisms. It was noticed that around a large colony of a contaminating mould the staphylococcus colonies became transparent and were obviously undergoing lysis (see Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fig. 1” refers to a “Photograph of a culture-plate.” It shows separate, well-grown staphylococcus colonies around 2-4 mm in diameter spread across most of the plate’s surface. But on one edge, a large mold colony of about 20 mm in diameter, plus a secondary satellite colony, is clearly visible. This is labeled “Penicillium colony.” Surrounding it is a zone of about 20 mm in which the staphylococcus colonies are either not visible or have become semi-transparent ghosts. Those nearest to the mold are smaller than the rest, only 0.4 to 0.8 mm, while those towards the periphery are a bit larger, 0.8 to 1.7 mm. Fleming has labeled these “Staphylococci undergoing lysis.” Later, Fleming and his colleagues would claim that this was the original contaminated plate from which Penicillium was first isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On its face, this seems simple enough. Everyone knows that penicillin destroys bacteria, and Fleming observed staphylococci seemingly being destroyed by a mold that produced penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, upon closer reading of Fleming’s 1929 paper, it becomes clear that a great deal of work was either omitted or inadequately described. There is, for example, no description of the type of culture medium used; whether or not the plate had been incubated; how long it had been on the bench; and, most important of all, what species of Staphylococcus was being studied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When publishing a scientific paper, scientists are expected to include a detailed description of their methods alongside their results. Like a recipe, these methods should clearly and comprehensively describe the materials used and the steps taken so that other scientists can replicate the experiment. And while incomplete or poorly-described methods are a perennial problem, the omission of these key experimental details (even in a report on an accidental discovery) is surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This became a problem when, as interest in penicillin grew, other investigators tried to repeat Fleming’s discovery. In 1944, Margaret Jennings (who later married a long-time colleague and penicillin researcher, Howard Florey) spread purified penicillin onto plates of fully grown staphylococci. This should have had a more potent effect than Fleming’s pictured in Figure 1, which was allegedly produced only with the crude “mould juice” from an accidental contaminant. Jennings, however, observed no visible change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1965, the pathologist W.D. Foster attempted a similar experiment using penicillin crystals dropped directly onto staphylococcus colonies, creating “astronomical” concentrations within their vicinity. But still, the colonies remained unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other attempts at replication called into question whether the mold could have even grown on a plate full of staphylococci. Pharmacologist D.B. Colquhoun claimed that, in 1955, he found that Penicillium mold refused to grow on a plate already full of staphylococcus colonies. Or, that, if it did, it produced no visible effect on the colonies. He could, however, see an effect if the sequence of events was reversed: if the mold was allowed to grow for several days first, and the staphylococci was later inoculated onto the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although these failures are hard to reconcile with Fleming’s account, they are in line with what we now know about the biology of penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1940, the physician A.D. Gardner, researching alongside Florey, peered into his microscope to examine how penicillin affected individual bacterial cells. Surprisingly, adult cells seemed to be largely unaffected; however, when they divided, the young cells grew “as immense swollen filaments.” Like party balloons, they elongated and expanded, then popped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The morphological changes,” observed bacteriologist J.P. Duguid in 1946, “suggest that penicillin in these concentrations interferes specifically with the formation of the outer supporting cell wall, while otherwise allowing growth to proceed until the organism finally bursts its defective envelope and so undergoes lysis.” At the time, this was largely speculation. Not much was known about the biology of bacterial cell walls. But after a decade of study — motivated in no small part by a desire to understand how penicillin worked — this hypothesis has largely been proven correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bacterial cell wall is a rigid, mesh-like structure composed primarily of peptidoglycan, a large macromolecule consisting of small subunits cross-linked by specialized enzymes called transpeptidases. The job of the cell wall is to maintain the cell’s shape and keep it from absorbing too much water. If the outward pressure from the cell’s contents becomes too great for the delicate cell membrane to contain, it bursts, spilling the cell’s innards. The cell wall, like a heavy-duty bicycle tire around a rubber inner tube, helps to resist this pressure, protecting the cell from mechanical stresses both inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike a bike tire, however, cell walls need to be able to grow with the cells they enclose. To accommodate increasing cell size, bacteria are continuously breaking and rebuilding the peptidoglycan mesh. This is where penicillin comes in. Because penicillin has a similar chemical structure to a peptidoglycan subunit, it can bind to the transpeptidases that complete the final step in cell wall biosynthesis.3 When this happens, penicillin forms a covalent bond in the transpeptidase’s active site, irreversibly inactivating the enzyme. As it grows, the cell continues to disassemble its cell wall, but without the use of its transpeptidases, it can no longer rebuild it. Over time, the cell wall weakens and eventually bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This explains why Jennings and others couldn’t replicate Fleming’s contaminated plate. A mature colony is mostly composed of adult or dead cells. These cells are unaffected by penicillin because they aren’t actively growing, and so aren’t actively breaking and rebuilding their cell wall. As a result, penicillin doesn’t cause mature cells to lyse, and the colony’s overall appearance doesn’t change. But if the penicillin is present before the staphylococci, it prevents the bacteria from growing and dividing, or they do so much more slowly. When that happens, they don’t form visible colonies. Thus, penicillin does not dissolve fully grown colonies, as Fleming had initially assumed, but inhibits their growth from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difficulty replicating Fleming’s discovery is frustrated by the ease with which it’s possible to “rediscover” penicillin by reversing the order of growth. By first growing Penicillium mold until it becomes a large colony, then seeding the plate with staphylococci, the result is indistinguishable from Fleming’s original plate. However, no trained scientist would intentionally use a culture plate visibly contaminated with a large mold — and certainly not an expert bacteriologist like Fleming.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no contemporary records to corroborate the story that Fleming discovered the contaminated culture plate when he returned from holiday on September 3rd: no lab notebook records, calendar notes, diary entries, or any letters. In the 1929 paper, the figure is simply labeled, “Photograph of a culture-plate.” The only evidence we have stems from recollections by Fleming and colleagues years later, after penicillin was recognized as a runaway clinical success. Fleming himself described the Figure 1 plate as the “original culture plate” in a 1944 paper. Yet, he also included the disclaimer that “after a lapse of fifteen years it is very difficult to say just what processes of thought were involved.”5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The earliest recorded mention of the mold and penicillin is an experiment written in Fleming’s lab notebook dated October 30th, 1928 — nearly two months after he purportedly found the culture plate. Curiously, it does not describe the chance discovery of a contaminant, but a carefully constructed experiment that suggests Fleming had already spent some time isolating and characterizing the mold. In it, Fleming used the reversed-sequence culturing method: first, placing a mold spore on the plate and letting it grow into a large, penicillin-producing colony, then inoculating several pathogenic species of bacteria, including staphylococci, near the mold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On October 30th, Fleming recorded the results: the mold affected a whole host of pathogens, including staphylococci, which could not grow near the mold. It’s a fine experiment, but it’s clearly not the discovery of an accidentally contaminated culture plate. This raises the question: What was Fleming doing for the previous two months, and if he was working with penicillin, why didn’t he bother recording any of it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, these scientific inconsistencies and experimental failures have haunted the story of penicillin’s discovery. Amidst the incontrovertible Nobel Prize-winning scientific and clinical success of penicillin — and without a plausible alternative — the doubters kept quiet. At least, most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ronald Hare’s Theory (1970)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1964, the bacteriologist Ronald Hare took up the puzzle of penicillin’s origins. After examining old lab notebooks and conducting experiments of his own, he would conclude that “the history of both the culture plate and the mould itself must have been very different from what had previously been thought to be the case.” Hare published his own theory on penicillin’s discovery in his 1970 book, The Birth of Penicillin, and the Disarming of Microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare was uniquely positioned to investigate this mystery. Not only was he an accomplished bacteriologist and expert on penicillin, having spent 20 years as a Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London, and the ten years before that at the University of Toronto, where he was largely responsible for planning and building the Canadian Government’s penicillin plant; he started his career in the same department as Fleming at St. Mary’s. In fact, he claims to have been in the laboratory the very day Fleming discovered the now-famous culture plate. (Despite this close professional association, however, Hare claims to have played no part in the discovery or original research on penicillin nor to have discussed them with Fleming.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although that discovery is now regarded as one of the most significant scientific events of the 20th century, Hare admits that, at the time, it made little to no impression on him or any of his colleagues. “The rest of us, being engaged in researches that seemed far more important than a contaminated culture plate, merely glanced at it, thought that it was no more than another wonder that Fleming seemed to be forever unearthing, and promptly forgot all about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, Hare had been skeptical from the start that penicillin could have been discovered by simple contamination of a culture plate. It was such a common occurrence in biology laboratories that “if this had been the sequence of events, penicillin would probably have been discovered while Fleming was still a child.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After retirement, Hare took up the penicillin question. He began by attempting to replicate Fleming’s discovery. He seeded an ordinary culture plate with staphylococci, incubated it until colonies were visible, then placed a few mold spores on the surface. As the microbiologists before him had observed, the mold refused to grow. He tried coaxing the mold’s growth by plating it further and further away from any staphylococcal colonies (without deviating too far from the overall appearance of Fleming’s Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this approach, he was finally able to get the mold to grow and produce penicillin, but still the staphylococcal colonies were unaffected. “No one looking at such a plate could possibly guess that a powerful antibacterial substance was emanating from the mould.” If, however, he reversed the order and plated the mold before the staphylococci, he could get a result “almost indistinguishable from that of Fleming’s original plate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vexed, Hare reevaluated the evidence. He had shown the mold couldn’t have contaminated the plate after the staphylococci because the mold wouldn’t grow (or, if it did, the penicillin wouldn’t affect the staphylococcus colonies). He assumed that the contamination couldn’t have occurred before the staphylococci (though that reliably recreates the plate pictured) because no bacteriologist would knowingly use a contaminated plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if the mold contaminated the plate at the same time, or within a few hours, of when it was seeded with staphylococci? And what if the staphylococci’s growth had been paused (somehow) until the mold colony had matured? To Fleming’s eyes, he would have assumed he had inoculated staphylococci onto a contamination-free culture plate. Yet, with the staphylococci’s growth delayed, the mold would have had time to fully develop into a large, penicillin-producing colony. When the staphylococci’s growth was restarted, it would be growing in effectively the same conditions as if it had been plated after the mold had grown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare knew just the thing that could arrest the staphylococci’s growth: low temperature. Staphylococci grow most rapidly at 98.6 °F (37 °C). As a human pathogen, it has evolved to grow optimally at human body temperature. This is why microbiologists incubate culture plates: to speed up their growth into visible colonies. The lowest temperature at which any staphylococci growth occurs, and then only very slowly, is around 53 °F (12 °C). The Penicillium mold, on the other hand, prefers to grow around 77 °F (25 °C) but is not greatly affected by temperature ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It therefore seemed possible that penicillin could have been discovered as described in the original 1929 paper, but with the addition a few details Fleming was unaware of: first, the inoculation of staphylococci and contamination by mold occurred at the same time; second, Fleming forgot6 to incubate the plate; and third, the lab’s room temperature was low enough for long enough for the mold to grow and produce penicillin before the staphylococci began to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test this theory, Hare simultaneously inoculated a culture plate with both staphylococci and Fleming’s mold and left it on his benchtop. The weather that day was cold, wet, and stormy, and the temperature was relatively low: 61 to 65 °F (16.1 to 18.3 °C). As expected, the staphylococci grew more slowly than they would have in an incubator, and only tiny transparent colonies were visible on the third day. The mold, however, grew much more prolifically, and a tiny colony was visible after just 48 hours, growing to 10 mm by the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of the fifth day, Hare had rediscovered penicillin. The result was practically indistinguishable from the photo in Fleming’s original paper: in a ten millimeter zone around the mold, the staphylococcus colonies were small and transparent, while those outside the zone were larger and opaque. Many experiments later, Hare found that penicillin could reliably be rediscovered in this manner so long as the temperature was kept below 68 °F (20 °C) for four or five days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where Hare the scientist had to become Hare the historian. Was the temperature in Fleming’s laboratory low enough for him to discover penicillin at the end of July or the beginning of August in accordance with the timeline of his canonical story?7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare searched the records at the Meteorological Office for the maximum and minimum shade temperatures from the beginning of July to the end of September, 1928. In the weeks before Fleming left on holiday there was a heatwave; from July 10th to 27th, there were highs in the upper 70s and 80s. At these temperatures, the staphylococci would have grown too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, on the 28th, the heatwave ended and was quickly replaced by a cold snap. For the next nine days, the maximum temperature only exceeded 68 °F on two occasions, and not by much. It was a slim window, in which the temperature in Fleming’s laboratory would have been low enough. But it coincided perfectly with Fleming’s holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare’s theory relies on a triple chance of unlikely events. First, the penicillin-producing Penicillium mold landed on Fleming’s culture plate; second, Fleming failed to incubate the plate; and third, the temperature was low enough for the five days required to favor mold growth.8 “Had only one link in this chain been broken,” Hare writes. “Fleming would have missed his opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare himself concedes that the combination of these contingencies seems exceptionally unlikely. The original story of chance discovery, on its own, was one of serendipity and good fortune. His theory required an additional layer of meteorological luck on top of chance contamination. “Far from the phenomenon that led to the discovery being a comparatively common event that had previously escaped detection, it must be so unusual an occurrence that it is doubtful whether it can have happened very often since bacteria were first cultivated in the laboratory.” Yet, however improbable it may seem, to quote Sherlock Holmes: “When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Robert Root-Bernstein’s Theory (1989)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare’s theory is based on the assumption that the Figure 1 plate was indeed the source of the original contamination. It also overlooks the two-month gap between when Fleming allegedly noticed the contaminated plate and recorded the first penicillin experiment. These details, however, form the foundation of a competing theory on penicillin’s origins — that belonging to Robert Root-Bernstein, Professor of Physiology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein described his theory in his 1989 book, Discovering: Inventing and Solving Problems at the Frontiers of Science.9 It’s an ambitious and unorthodox book, structured as a seminar between six characters discussing creativity and the scientific process. Each character represents various points of view on the sciences and scientists and, along the way, they also discuss the important chronological and methodological idiosyncrasies of Fleming’s discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein’s theory is argued and defended by the character Imp (real name Ernest; apparently a stand-in for the author himself). After summarizing the key details of Hare’s theory, Imp focuses on the two-month gap. Fleming supposedly discovered the Fig. 1 contaminated plate when he returned from a holiday on September 3rd, but the first lab notebook entry about Penicillium and penicillin wasn’t written until October 30th. As described earlier, that entry does not record the discovery of a contaminated plate but a planned experiment in which the Penicillium mold was first isolated and tested against several bacteria, including staphylococci.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why, Imp wonders, if Fleming already had that beautiful culture plate which so perfectly illustrated the staphylococci-killing power of penicillin, he would wait two months to record the finding? And why do so in the context of another experiment? Furthermore, this plate still exists within the British Museum. That means Fleming had to fix it with formaldehyde relatively soon after he found it. But if he thought the plate was important enough to preserve, why didn’t he note its discovery at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t in Fleming’s character to procrastinate. According to his research scholar, Merlyn Pryce: “[Fleming] didn’t confine himself to observing, but took action at once. Lots of people observe a phenomenon, feeling that it may be important, but they don’t get beyond being surprised — after which, they forget. That was never the case with Fleming.” So then, what was he doing for two months?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s in this context that Imp (Root-Bernstein) grounds his belief that Fleming’s discovery wasn’t the serendipitous chance of lore — at least, not completely. Instead, he proposes that Fleming wasn’t running a staphylococcus experiment when he discovered penicillin; he was looking for new sources of lysozyme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming had a long-standing professional interest in antibacterial substances. His most important discovery before penicillin was the lysozymes, enzymes found in various bodily fluids (e.g., tears, saliva, and egg whites) that break down the cell walls of bacteria. He had also studied the antibacterial properties of mercuric chloride and bacteriophages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 1922 and 1928, Fleming’s team tested anything they could get their hands on: human mucus, tears, sputum, and blood; the eggs of dozens of fish and bird species; tears collected from horses, cows, hens, ducks, geese, and fifty other species from the London Zoo; earthworm and snail slime; large numbers of vegetables and flowers. They continued to publish on lysozymes into the 1930s. “Is it too much to suggest,” Imp asked, “that he also examined any fungus that happened to come his way?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we assume that Fleming was engaged in a systematic search for new sources of lysozyme, we can now reasonably fill in the gap between September 3rd, when he first spots the mold, and October 30th, when he first records the Penicillium experiment. Root-Bernstein’s theory about the discovery goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Fleming begins by finding the mold, which may or may not have been on a staphylococcus plate. In the paper, Fleming only says that he found it at the time he was “working with staphylococcus variants.” Either way, the plate is not enough to incite a “Eureka!” moment, as the canonical version of the story suggests.10 Instead, like the hundreds of other unusual samples he’s tested, Fleming transfers the mold to a new culture plate, gives it a few days to establish itself, and then runs a routine experiment to test for lysozyme activity. He finds that it weakly affects a lysozyme-sensitive strain. Not terribly interesting — not even worth recording11 — but it warrants a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A short time later, the Root-Bernstein theory goes, Fleming prepares a second experiment. After growing the mold for five days into a robust colony, he adds various lysozyme-sensitive and -resistant species to the plate, including Staphylococcus. This time, he records the results because (surprise!) the mold affects the lysozyme-resistant staphylococci. This experiment, whose results are recorded on October 30th, is exactly what it appears to be within the context of Fleming’s notebooks: “the first penicillin experiment — the first recognition by Fleming that he’s dealing with something unexpected and exciting!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, if this is the true sequence of events, why didn’t Fleming record it as such in his 1929 paper? “The logic of presentation rarely corresponds to the logic of discovery,” said Imp. Few scientists actually document the chronological sequence of events that led to their discovery. “Just imagine for a moment trying to write into a research paper the account I’ve just given,” said Imp:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While looking essentially randomly for organisms producing lysozyme, a common but unidentified mold was isolated from the air of the laboratory. Initial experiments showed that the mold appeared to have lysozyme activity, so controls were set up, including staphylococci, which I just happened to have been working on at the time. Much to my surprise, the mold had unexpected properties, so I was now forced to further characterize and identify the mold …This subsequent research conclusively demonstrated that the product of the mold was not lysozyme, but rather a new substance having the following characteristics …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s too circuitous and indirect for a scientific report. Better, instead, to start with the mold lysing the pathogen, because that was the important and novel observation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under this theory of events, the Figure 1 plate also becomes exactly what it appears to be in its proper context: an illustrative example of the fact that penicillin-secreting Penicillium can kill staphylococci. Not, as the story is typically told, the original contaminated plate. Reading further in the paper, similar examples are included as Figures 3 and 4, which illustrate other properties of penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming still could have shown his colleagues a contaminated staphylococcus plate on September 3rd, but one which must not have had the telltale “ring of death.” Or perhaps he did pass around the plate that would become the famous Figure 1, but not until several months later, when he was preparing figures for his paper. Hare’s cold snap, too, may have played a role in the mold growing when it did, but it no longer has to coincide with Fleming inoculating his staphylococcus plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Fleming was originally searching for new sources of lysozyme could also explain why he thought the mold contaminated a staphylococcus plate after the colonies had fully grown (which, barring Hare’s theory of simultaneous contamination, should be impossible). Penicillin may not be able to lyse mature colonies, but lysozymes can. Fleming may have assumed penicillin lyses bacteria the same way as lysozymes, and therefore could lyse mature colonies. It’s a conceptual leap, but one made smaller if he was looking for lysozymes in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Hare, Root-Bernstein does not claim his account of Fleming’s discovery is “true,” only that it’s compatible with available data. (Root-Bernstein does not, however, shy away from claiming that his theory is the more likely of the two. “Hare may be a good bacteriologist,” said Imp, “but I question his historical acumen. Dates — you’ve got to pay attention to dates.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More important to Root-Bernstein than the specifics of Fleming’s discovery is the fact that it evidences Pasteur’s principle that “chance favors only the prepared mind.” Whether he was experimenting with staphylococci or lysozyme, Fleming kept his mind open to the possibility of discovering new bacteriolytic substances. He often gave the advice, “Never neglect an extraordinary appearance or happening. It may be — usually is, in fact — a false alarm that leads to nothing, but may on the other hand be the clue provided by fate to lead you to some important advance.”12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming’s methods — which included testing strange samples and keeping plates around for longer than he needed them — increased the probability that he would stumble upon something new, and he was mentally prepared to recognize them when he did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Source of the Mold&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other important aspect of Fleming’s discovery is the source of the contaminating mold. According to the canonical version of the story, the Penicillium floated into Fleming’s lab from an open window. However, no such claim was made in the 1929 paper. In fact, nothing about its source was said until 1945 when Fleming told the writer George Lacken that it had blown through the window from Praed Street.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Fleming would say this is a mystery. He had no evidence that was the case, and as Hare writes, opening a laboratory window is “thoroughly bad bacteriology.” Further, Fleming’s windowsill was often piled high with test tubes and beakers filled with pathogenic bacteria. It would have created quite a scandal should any of these have fallen out of an open window onto the heads of the vulnerable passersby below. Nevertheless, the story gained wide publicity after André Maurois repeated it in his 1959 biography, The Life of Sir Alexander Fleming. Maurois repeatedly referred to “the mysterious mould from Praed Street,” and “the spore carried by the wind.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming himself seemed unsure of its origins. In a 1946 speech at the Mayo Clinic, he claimed ignorance of its source, “a mould spore coming from I don’t know where, dropped on the plate.” But in another speech in Edinburgh that same year, he claimed, “penicillium had dropped through the window.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Hare’s account, the Penicillium came not from the window but the stairwell. In Hare’s 1970 book, he notes how immediately below Fleming’s laboratory, in the same turret of the building, was a mycology lab run by C.J. La Touche. La Touche studied how molds can trigger asthma. He spent much of his time swabbing carpets and curtains in homes inhabited by asthma patients and growing strange and uncommon species of mold from these samples. In the process, he had acquired quite a large collection. But, as Hare recalls from his time working in the same building, La Touche’s lab wasn’t equipped with the fume cupboards or hoods that most mycologists used to prevent mold spores from contaminating the air. As a result, the air in La Touche’s was liable to be full of floating spores, waiting to be carried wherever the breeze might take them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both La Touche and Fleming’s labs had doors that opened to a shared stairwell. It is therefore likely that the spore that contaminated Fleming’s plate had originated in La Touche’s laboratory, having traveled out the door of La Touche’s lab, up the stairs, and into Fleming’s. Yet even if none of La Touche’s spores took this journey, at the very least, La Touche himself did: Fleming cites La Touche as the mycologist who identified the mold as Penicillium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Theories, Plausible and Implausible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we approach the 100th anniversary of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin, no definitive answer to this mystery has emerged. Other scientists have proposed a handful of additional theories,13 some of which rely on events even less likely than Hare’s, but Hare and Root-Bernstein’s seem to be rooted in the most solid evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, I believe Root-Bernstein’s theory. Hare’s is scientifically possible, but it relies on an exceptionally improbable sequence of events requiring luck on the order of picking the correct Powerball numbers three (or more) times in a row. Root-Bernstein’s is simpler and more in tune with the psychology and habits of working scientists. It only requires accepting that Fleming and his colleagues misremembered the identity of an unrecorded and, admittedly, forgettable culture plate from 15 years earlier — which seems entirely plausible. Occam’s razor suggests the simplest explanation is usually the best one, and that is Root-Bernstein’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin is not just an interesting historical anecdote; it’s held up as a prime example of momentous inventions discovered by accident. It looms large among discussions about the nature of discovery and how to encourage it. But if Root-Bernstein’s theory is true, and Fleming actually found penicillin while searching for new lysozymes instead of while doing an unrelated staphylococcus experiment, can it really be called an accident?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, penicillin isn’t lysozyme, and a deliberate search for one thing that results in finding something else can still be deemed accidental. Yet, finding a new kind of bacteriolytic substance while looking for a different kind of bacteriolytic substance seems, at least, to be one of a lesser order. Fleming may have been fishing for lysozyme, but his methods — testing strange contaminants for the ability to lyse other microbes — formed a net that, sooner or later, was bound to catch something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein’s theory thus turns penicillin from an example of an “accidental discovery” into one that reflects what the computational biologists Itai Yanai and Martin Lercher have described as an “evolutionary process” in scientific research. In this conception, research isn’t a linear march, but an evolutionary tree, full of once-promising branches that proved fruitless and unexpected offshoots that led to new discoveries. Such an evolutionary history, they argue, “is generally obscured in the resulting scientific publication,” which favors neat teleology. &lt;lb/&gt;Fleming’s 1929 penicillin paper may have been written as a linear process, but that’s almost certainly not how the discovery occurred. And by eliminating these complicated twists and turns, Fleming inadvertently obscured what may be one of the most important lessons in scientific history: how combining a meticulous research program with the openness to branch out into new directions led him to Nobel Prize-winning success. Neither rigid plans nor the winds of chance are enough on their own; discovery requires both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, whatever sequence of events actually occurred, what mattered was that Fleming was primed to make the key observation when chance presented it and jumped on what he saw. The rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reasons why Fleming did not pursue penicillin research further has been attributed to a multiple technical, institutional, and personal reasons, the history of which could be an essay in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of how they were discovered, transpeptidases were originally named “penicillin binding proteins” (PBPs). However, binding to penicillin is not their normal function, to my great confusion as a microbiology undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1927, Fleming was the “obvious choice” to write the chapter on staphylococci in the large nine-volume System of Bacteriology. This was generally referred to as “the Bible” in bacteriology labs because it was supposed to contain the whole of existing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Casting further doubt, Fleming stated in that same paper, that “what had originally been a well-grown staphylococcal colony was now a faint shadow of its former self,” but we now know that is not possible. Fleming’s colleagues have also claimed that was the plate Fleming showed them in September. Yet, here again, no records verify this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not incubating the plate may have been done intentionally. Fleming was known to make “agar art,” pictures on culture plates done by “painting” with colorful bacteria. Though incubation is standard practice because it grows bacteria quickly, it can affect how vivid the colors of the colonies appear. Some suspect Fleming may have deliberately failed to incubate his staphylococci just to see what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was before climate control systems and LEED-certified buildings. Though a gas fire kept Fleming’s laboratory warm in the winter, for the rest of the year the temperature could fluctuate violently from the heat of the sun and cold winds from the east and south.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, four unlikely events combine. Fleming later claimed that he had already discarded the plate onto a pile in a Lysol bath, and it was only later, while talking with his research scholar, Merlyn Pryce, that he noticed the historic plate, high and dry, and rescued it. Had the pile been cleared away a little sooner, or the antiseptic bath filled a little deeper, then that one-in-a-million plate would have been lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was made aware of Root-Bernstein’s theory, and in turn the entire alternate universe of penicillin theories, by William Rosen’s 2018 book, Miracle Cure: The Creation of Antibiotics and the Birth of Modern Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, it has been claimed that, instead of “Eureka!” Fleming muttered the more modest, “that’s funny…”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Hare writes, “what mattered most to Fleming was not the recording of his experiments but his performance.” The absence of lab notebook entries, therefore, is not necessarily evidence that he didn’t run any experiments between September 3rd and October 30th. It could just as well have been that none were interesting enough to be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google unkills JPEG XL?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick summary of the format’s road to stardom&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve written about JPEG XL in the past. First, I noted Google’s move to kill the format in Chromium in favor of the homegrown and inferior AVIF.12 Then, I had a deeper look at the format, and visually compared JPEG XL with AVIF on a handful of images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latter post started with a quick support test:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“If you are browsing this page around 2023, chances are that your browser supports AVIF but does not support JPEG XL.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, here we are at the end of 2025, and this very sentence still holds true. Unless you are one of the 17% of users using Safari3, or are adventurous enough to use a niche browser like Thorium or LibreWolf, chances are you see the AVIF banner in green and the JPEG XL image in black/red.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news is, this will change soon. In a dramatic turn of events, the Chromium team has reversed its &lt;code&gt;Obsolete&lt;/code&gt; tag, and has decided to support the format in Blink (the engine behind Chrome/Chromium/Edge). Given Chrome’s position in the browser market share, I predict the format will become a de factor standard for images in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s recap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been following JPEG XL since its experimental support in Blink. What started as a promising feature was quickly axed by the team in a bizarre and ridiculous manner. First, they asked the community for feedback on the format. Then, the community responded very positively. And I don’t only mean a couple of guys in their basement. Meta, Intel, Cloudinary, Adobe, &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;libvips&lt;/code&gt;, Krita, and many more. After that came the infamous comment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;da...@chromium.orgda...@chromium.org&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;#85 Oct 31, 2022 12:34AM&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thank you everyone for your comments and feedback regarding JPEG XL. We will be removing the JPEG XL code and flag from Chromium for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Experimental flags and code should not remain indefinitely&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is not enough interest from the entire ecosystem to continue experimenting with JPEG XL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new image format does not bring sufficient incremental benefits over existing formats to warrant enabling it by default&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By removing the flag and the code in M110, it reduces the maintenance burden and allows us to focus on improving existing formats in Chrome&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, right, “not enough interest from the entire ecosystem”. Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, following this comment, a steady stream of messages pointed out how wrong that was, from all the organizations mentioned above and many more. People were noticing in blog posts, videos, and social media interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strangely, the following few years have been pretty calm for JPEG XL. However, a few notable events did take place. First, the Firefox team showed interest in a JPEG XL Rust decoder, after describing their stance on the matter as “neutral”. They were concerned about the increased attack surface resulting from including the current 100K+ lines C++ &lt;code&gt;libjxl&lt;/code&gt; reference decoder, even though most of those lines are testing code. In any case, they kind of requested a “memory-safe” decoder. This seems to have kick-started the Rust implementation, jxl-rs, from Google Research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To top it off, a couple of weeks ago, the PDF Association announced their intent to adopt JPEG XL as a preferred image format in their PDF specification. The CTO of the PDF Association, Peter Wyatt, expressed their desire to include JPEG XL as the preferred format for HDR content in PDF files.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chromium’s new stance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this pressure exerted steadily over time made the Chromium team reconsider the format. They tried to kill it in favor of AVIF, but that hasn’t worked out. Rick Byers, on behalf of Chromium, made a comment in the Blink developers Google group about the team welcoming a performant and memory-safe JPEG XL decoder in Chromium. He stated that the change of stance was in light of the positive signs from the community we have exposed above (Safari support, Firefox updating their position, PDF, etc.). Quickly after that, the Chromium issue state was changed from &lt;code&gt;Obsolete&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Assigned&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About JPEG XL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great news for the format, and I believe it will give it the final push for mass adoption. The format is excellent for all kinds of purposes, and I’ll be adopting it pretty much instantly for this and the Gaia Sky website when support is shipped. Some of the features that make it superior to the competition are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lossless re-compression of JPEG images. This means you can re-compress your current JPEG library without losing information and benefit from a ~30% reduction in file size for free. This is a killer feature that no other format has.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for wide gamut and HDR.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for image sizes of up to 1,073,741,823x1,073,741,824. You won’t run out of image space anytime soon. AVIF is ridiculous in this aspect, capping at 8,193x4,320. WebP goes up to 16K2, while the original 1992 JPEG supports 64K2.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum of 32 bits per channel. No other format (except for the defunct JPEG 2000) offers this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum of 4,099 channels. Most other formats support 4 or 5, with the exception of JPEG 2000, which supports 16,384.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JXL is super resilient to generation loss.5&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JXL supports progressive decoding, which is essential for web delivery, IMO. WebP or HEIC have no such feature. Progressive decoding in AVIF was added a few years back.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for animation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for alpha transparency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Depth map support.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a full codec feature breakdown, see Battle of the Codecs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JPEG XL is the future of image formats. It checks all the right boxes, and it checks them well. Support in the overwhelmingly most popular browser engine is probably going to be a crucial stepping stone in the format’s path to stardom. I’m happy that the Chromium team reconsidered their inclusion, but I am sad that it took so long and so much pressure from the community to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question Sheon Han poses â âIs Ruby a serious programming language?â â says a lot about what someone thinks programming is supposed to feel like. For some folks, if a tool feels good to useâ¦ that must mean it isnât âserious.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruby never agreed to that definition. If it did, I missed the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you arrived late, you missed a chapter when the language felt like a quiet rebellion. The community was small. The energy was playful. Ruby tapped you on the shoulder and asked what would happen if programming didnât have to feel intimidatingâ¦ what might be possible if clarity and joy were allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early skeptics were predictable. Java architects. Enterprise traditionalists. Anyone whose identity depended on programming being a stern activity. They said Ruby was unserious. And the community mostly shruggedâ¦ because we were busy building things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruby made programming approachable. Not simplisticâ¦ approachable. That distinction matters. It helped beginners see the path forward. It helped small teams build momentum before anxiety caught up. It helped experienced developers rediscover a sense of lightness in their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why bootcamps embraced it. Why tiny startups found traction with it. Ruby wasnât trying to win benchmarksâ¦ it was trying to keep you moving. When youâre creating something new, that matters far more than the theoretical purity of your type system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yesâ¦ critics love the Twitter example. But look closer. Ruby carried them further than most companies will ever reach. They outgrew their shoes. Thatâs not an indictmentâ¦ thatâs success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my worldâ¦ running a software consultancy for a few decadesâ¦ Iâve never seen a team fail because they chose Ruby. I have seen them fail because they chose complexity. Because they chose indecision. Because they chose âseriousnessâ over momentum. Ruby just needed to stay out of the way so people could focus on the real work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And while folks keep debating its âcredibility,â the receipts are plain. Shopify moves billions through Ruby. Doximity supports most physicians in the US with Ruby. GitHub held the worldâs source code together for years using Ruby. This isnât sentiment. This is proof.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What outsiders often miss is the culture. Ruby attracts people who care how code feels to write and read. Not because of nostalgiaâ¦ but because most of our careers are spent living inside someone elseâs decisions. Joy isnât a luxury. Itâs how sustainable software gets made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I donât know Sheon personally, but Iâm guessing we have as much in common about music tastes as we do whether _whyâs Poignant Guide to Ruby made any sense to them. And thatâs fine. Thatâs actually the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruby attracts a particular kind of person. Not better. Not smarter. Justâ¦ different. People who care how code feels to write and read. People who see programming as a craft that can be expressive. People who understand that most of our careers are spent living inside someone elseâs decisions, so joy isnât a luxuryâ¦ itâs the only way this work stays humane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And on that noteâ¦ thereâs one thing I genuinely agree with Sheon about. Ruby doesnât seem to be for them. Thatâs not a failure of the language. Thatâs just taste. Some people like jazz. Some like metal. Some prefer the comfort of ceremony. Ruby has never tried to convert anyone. It simply resonates with the people it resonates with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since weâre noting taste, Iâll add something of my own. As an atheist, it feels oddly appropriate to mention my lack of religion hereâ¦ mostly because it mirrors how strangely irrelevant it was for the article to bring up Matzâs religion at all. It didnât add context. It didnât deepen the argument. It was justâ¦ there. A detail reaching for meaning that wasnât actually connected to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sheon mentions approaching Ruby without âthe forgiving haze of sentimentality.â Fair enough. But the sentiment wasnât nostalgia. It was gratitude. Gratitude for a language that centers the human being. Gratitude for a community that believes programming can be expressive. Gratitude for a tool that makes the work feel lighter without making it careless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But hereâs the part the discourse keeps missingâ¦ this isnât just about the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of programming is fuzzy for everyone. Anyone claiming to have the master recipe for whatâs coming is bullshitting you. The future wonât be owned by one paradigm or one language or one ideology. Itâll be a blendâ¦ a messy collage of ideas, old and new, borrowed and rediscovered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in that futureâ¦ Rubyâs values arenât relics. Theyâre an anchor. Readability will matter more as AI writes more code. Maintainability will matter more as products live longer. Joy will matter more as burnout becomes the default state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you need a reminder that seriousness isnât the reliable signal people wish it wereâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The serious candidate doesnât always get elected.&lt;lb/&gt; The serious musician doesnât always get signed.&lt;lb/&gt; The serious artist doesnât always sell.&lt;lb/&gt; The serious man doesnât always find a serious relationship.&lt;lb/&gt; The serious startup doesnât always find product-market fit.&lt;lb/&gt; The serious engineer doesnât always write the code that lasts.&lt;lb/&gt; The serious rewrite doesnât always solve the real problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Culture doesnât reliably reward the serious. Neither does business.&lt;lb/&gt; It rewards the resonant. The clear. The human. The work that connects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruby has always leaned toward that side of the craft. Toward the part of programming that remembers people are involved. Toward the part that says maybe the code should serve the teamâ¦ not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And honestlyâ¦ I think unserious people will play an important role in the future too. The curious ones. The playful ones. The ones who keep the door propped open instead of guarding it. Theyâll keep the industry honest. Theyâll keep it human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So is Ruby âseriousâ? I still think thatâs the wrong question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A better one isâ¦ does Ruby still have something meaningful to contribute to the next chapter of software?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It does.&lt;lb/&gt; And if that makes it âunseriousââ¦ maybe thatâs exactly why it belongs in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ghostty for the web with xterm.js API compatibility — giving you a proper VT100 implementation in the browser, not a JavaScript approximation of one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Migrate from xterm by changing your import: &lt;code&gt;@xterm/xterm&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;ghostty-web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WASM-compiled parser from Ghostty—the same code that runs the native app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero runtime dependencies, ~400KB WASM bundle&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally created for Mux (a desktop app for isolated, parallel agentic development), but designed to be used anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npx @ghostty-web/demo@next&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This starts a local HTTP server with a real shell on &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt;. Works best on Linux and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;xterm.js is everywhere—VS Code, Hyper, countless web terminals. But it has fundamental issues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Issue&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;xterm.js&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;RTL languages&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Broken since 2017&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Works&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complex scripts (Devanagari, Arabic)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Rendering issues&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Proper grapheme handling&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;XTPUSHSGR/XTPOPSGR&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Not supported&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Full support&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;xterm.js reimplements terminal emulation in JavaScript. Every escape sequence, every edge case, every Unicode quirk—all hand-coded. Ghostty's emulator is the same battle-tested code that runs the native Ghostty app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install ghostty-web&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ghostty-web aims to be API-compatible with the xterm.js API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { init, Terminal } from 'ghostty-web';

await init();

const term = new Terminal({
  fontSize: 14,
  theme: {
    background: '#1a1b26',
    foreground: '#a9b1d6',
  },
});

term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));
term.onData((data) =&amp;gt; websocket.send(data));
websocket.onmessage = (e) =&amp;gt; term.write(e.data);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a comprehensive client &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; server example, refer to the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ghostty-web builds from Ghostty's source with a patch to expose additional functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Requires Zig and Bun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun run build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto (author of Ghostty) has been working on &lt;code&gt;libghostty&lt;/code&gt; which makes this all possible. The patches are very minimal thanks to the work the Ghostty team has done, and we expect them to get smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This library will eventually consume a native Ghostty WASM distribution once available, and will continue to provide an xterm.js compatible API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Coder we're big fans of Ghostty, so kudos to that team for all the amazing work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most metros are adding jobs more slowly than normal. Charlotte leads in job growth among major metros, while Austin and Denver fall far short of their historically strong pace.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High-income sectors are contracting, while Education and Healthcare are expanding faster than normal across most metros.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Employment composition matters as much as total growth for local housing market strength. Metros reliant on lower-wage job growth are likely to face softer for-sale demand.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;National job growth is slowing, but metro trends vary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The national labor market is softening, with implications for local housing markets. Most major metros are adding jobs more slowly than normal. We analyzed employment performance by metro and industry, comparing today’s growth to long-term trends since 2010. Red represents job losses, yellow shows slower-than-normal growth, and green represents faster-than-normal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;High-income job losses will reshape housing demand&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The job market drives housing demand, but the type of jobs created or lost impacts the type of housing. High-income sectors—Information, Professional Services, and Financial Activities—are shrinking across most major metros. Workers in these industries drive for-sale housing demand more than rental demand. Nationally, high-income sector employment remained flat YOY in August, well below its long-term compound annual growth of +1.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Education and Healthcare sectors account for the bulk of new jobs added in most metros and are growing faster than normal in almost every market. Many of these jobs pay lower wages on average and often generate rental demand more than homebuying activity. Nationally, education and healthcare employment rose +3.3% YOY in August, well above its long-term compound annual growth of +2.1%&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s happening in key metros&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Philadelphia (+1.8% YOY) and New York (+1.7% YOY) show stronger job growth than their historical trends (+1.1% and +1.6%, respectively). However, this improvement reflects recovery from weak post-Great Financial Crisis baselines rather than genuine outperformance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Charlotte (+2.6% YOY) is a standout performer, maintaining robust job growth supported by Professional Services expansion (+4.5% YOY)—a rare bright spot for for-sale demand.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Austin (+0.8% YOY) and Denver (+0.0% YOY) are growing much more slowly than their historically strong employment trends (+3.8% and +2.3%, respectively). Tech and Professional Services jobs are declining in both markets, and even healthcare—which is expanding faster than normal in most metros—shows weak growth here. This reduction in high-paying jobs is weakening demand for both home purchases and rentals.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Bay Area continues to lose jobs across high-income sectors (-0.4% YOY), driving modest overall employment declines. These job losses have slowed compared to a year ago but remain negative YOY. Despite generating substantial spending and wealth, the AI-driven tech boom hasn’t added meaningful employment to the region.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What this means for your business&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you build, invest, or advise in housing markets, these employment shifts will impact your growth opportunities in 2026 and beyond:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Homebuilders: Expect fewer qualified buyers. Position products at attainable price points and reconsider location strategies.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rental operators: Prepare for sustained demand from renters employed in healthcare and education.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Residential building products: Anticipate margin pressure as affordability challenges push builders toward smaller, cost-efficient designs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to stay ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our Metro and Regional Housing research package includes analysis of the latest demand, supply, and affordability fundamentals for each metro and region as well as results from our proprietary surveys. Our consulting team continually evaluates market feasibility, absorption/pricing/product recommendations, and overall investment/expansion strategy in markets nationwide. Combining these two areas of expertise yields qualitative and quantitative insight for more intelligent decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Durin is a library for reading and writing the Dwarf debugging format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It aims to support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading DWARF 5 encoded information from ELF and MachO object files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Writing DWARF 5 information into ELF and MachO object files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Writing DWARF 5 information into assembly files.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In future it could support DWARF 4 or newer versions of the DWARF standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should provide:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-platform: &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt;makes no assumptions about what kind of object file you're working with. Provide your own Buffer or use the&lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;library.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lazy: you can iterate compilation units without parsing their contents. Parse only as many debugging information entry (DIE) trees as you iterate over. &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt;also uses&lt;code&gt;DW_AT_sibling&lt;/code&gt;references to avoid parsing a DIE's children to find it's next sibling where possible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency, run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ opam install durin&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And add &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt; to your project's &lt;code&gt;dune-project&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;*.opam&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Apple turn to Intel for production of its M-series chips in 2027? That’s what supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted on X Friday. Citing his latest industry surveys, Kuo says that Intel’s chances of becoming Apple’s latest “advanced-node supplier… has improved significantly” in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Intel could finally return to Apple computers in 2027&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel could supply Apple’s lowest-end M chips by 2027, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel could supply Apple’s lowest-end M chips by 2027, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any deal with Intel would be significant considering the chipmaker famously missed out on supplying its own processors for the original iPhone. Apple now has a deal with Taiwan-based TSMC to supply silicon chips for its iPhone, iPad and Mac products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kuo says that Apple has a non-disclosure agreement with Intel to acquire the company’s 18AP PDK 0.9.1GA chips. At this point, the company is waiting on Intel to deliver the PDK 1.0/1.1 kit, which is supposed to arrive in the first quarter of 2026. If everything stays on track, Intel could start shipping Apple’s lowest-end M-series processor, built on the 18AP advanced node, sometime in the second or third quarter of 2027, Kuo says. But that timing still depends on how smoothly things go once Apple actually gets the PDK 1.0/1.1 kit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kuo theorizes that a deal with Intel could help Apple demonstrate to the Trump administration that its committed to “buying American” by rerouting its supply chain to include more US-based companies. For Intel, a deal could signal that the company’s worst days are passed. “Looking ahead, the 14A node and beyond could capture more orders from Apple and other tier-one customers, turning Intel’s long-term outlook more positive,” Kuo writes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Better than JSON&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or why I stopped using JSON for my APIs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you develop or use an API, there’s a 99% chance it exchanges data encoded in JSON. It has become the de facto standard for the modern web. And yet, for almost ten years, whenever I develop servers—whether for personal or professional projects—I do not use JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I find it surprising that JSON is so omnipresent when there are far more efficient alternatives, sometimes better suited to a truly modern development experience. Among them: Protocol Buffers, or Protobuf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, I’d like to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Serialization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before going any further, let’s put the topic back into context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allow two systems to communicate. In the web world, REST APIs—those using the HTTP protocol and its methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE…)—are by far the most widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a client sends a request to a server, it transmits a message containing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;headers, including the well-known &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates the message format (JSON, XML, Protobuf, etc.);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a body (payload), which contains the data itself;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a response status.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serialization is the process of turning a data structure into a sequence of bytes that can be transmitted. JSON, for example, serializes data as human-readable text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why is JSON so common?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for its popularity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Human-readable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JSON is easy to understand, even for non-developers. A simple &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; is often enough to inspect most data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Perfectly integrated into the web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was propelled by JavaScript, then massively adopted by backend frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Flexible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add a field, remove one, or change a type “on the fly.” Useful… sometimes too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tools everywhere&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Need to inspect JSON? Any text editor will do. Need to send a request? Curl is enough. Result: massive adoption, rich ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, despite these advantages, another format offers me better efficiency—for both developers and end users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Protobuf: ever heard of it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a strong chance you’ve never really worked with Protobuf. Yet this format was created as early as 2001 at Google and made public in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s heavily used inside Google and in many modern infrastructures—especially for inter-service communication in microservice architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why is it so discreet in public API development?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps because Protobuf is often associated with gRPC, and developers think they must use both together (which is false). Maybe also because it’s a binary format, making it feel less “comfortable” at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here’s why I personally use it almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Proto — Strong typing and modern tooling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With JSON, you often send ambiguous or non-guaranteed data. You may encounter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a missing field,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;an incorrect type,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a typo in a key,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;or simply an undocumented structure.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Protobuf, that’s impossible. Everything starts with a &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file that defines the structure of messages precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example of a Proto3 file&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;syntax = "proto3";

message User {
  int32 id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  string email = 3;
  bool isActive = 4;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each field has:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a strict type (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;int32&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;…)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a numeric identifier (1, 2, 3…)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a stable name (&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;…)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This file is then used to automatically generate code in your preferred language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You use &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;protoc --dart_out=lib user.proto
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and you automatically get the following in your Dart code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;final user = User()
  ..id = 42
  ..name = "Alice"
  ..email = "alice@example.com"
  ..isActive = true;

final bytes = user.writeToBuffer();       // Binary serialization
final sameUser = User.fromBuffer(bytes);  // Deserialization
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No manual validation. No JSON parsing. No risk of type errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this mechanism works with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dart&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TypeScript&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kotlin&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swift&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;C#&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and many more…&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It represents a huge time saver and brings exceptional maintainability comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Buffer — Ultra-efficient binary serialization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another major strength of Protobuf: it’s a binary format, designed to be compact and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s compare with JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example JSON message&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "isActive": true
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Size: 78 bytes (depending on whitespace).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The same message in Protobuf binary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;→ About 23 bytes. Roughly 3× more compact, and often much more depending on structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because Protobuf uses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;compact “varint” encoding for numbers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no textual keys (they’re replaced by numeric tags)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no spaces, no JSON overhead&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;optimized optional fields&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a very efficient internal structure&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;less bandwidth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;faster response times&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;savings on mobile data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;direct impact on user experience&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Example: a tiny Dart server using Shelf that returns Protobuf&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make things more concrete, let’s build a minimal HTTP server in Dart using the &lt;code&gt;shelf&lt;/code&gt; package, and return our &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; object serialized as Protobuf, with the correct &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll assume you already have the previously generated code for the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Create a simple Shelf server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a file &lt;code&gt;bin/server.dart&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import 'dart:io';

import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as shelf_io;
import 'package:shelf_router/shelf_router.dart';

import 'package:your_package_name/user.pb.dart'; // Adjust the path to your generated file

void main(List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; args) async {
  final router = Router()
    ..get('/user', _getUserHandler);

  final handler = const Pipeline()
      .addMiddleware(logRequests())
      .addHandler(router);

  final server = await shelf_io.serve(handler, InternetAddress.anyIPv4, 8080);
  print('Server listening on http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
}

Response _getUserHandler(Request request) {
  final user = User()
    ..id = 42
    ..name = 'Alice'
    ..email = 'alice@example.com'
    ..isActive = true;

  final bytes = user.writeToBuffer();

  return Response.ok(
    bytes,
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/protobuf',
    },
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;User()&lt;/code&gt;comes from the generated Protobuf code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;writeToBuffer()&lt;/code&gt;serializes the object into Protobuf binary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;header is set to&lt;code&gt;application/protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, allowing clients to know they must decode Protobuf instead of JSON.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calling the Protobuf API from Dart (using &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once your server returns a Protobuf-encoded &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;, you can retrieve and decode it directly from Dart.
All you need is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;package&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the generated Protobuf classes (&lt;code&gt;user.pb.dart&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a Dart file (e.g. &lt;code&gt;bin/client.dart&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

import 'package:your_package_name/user.pb.dart'; // Adjust path

Future&amp;lt;void&amp;gt; main() async {
  final uri = Uri.parse('http://localhost:8080/user');

  final response = await http.get(
    uri,
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'application/protobuf',
    },
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Decode the Protobuf bytes
    final user = User.fromBuffer(response.bodyBytes);

    print('User received:');
    print('  id       : ${user.id}');
    print('  name     : ${user.name}');
    print('  email    : ${user.email}');
    print('  isActive : ${user.isActive}');
  } else {
    print('Request failed: ${response.statusCode}');
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this setup, both the server and the client rely on the same Protobuf definition, ensuring that data structures stay perfectly aligned without manual validation or JSON parsing. The same &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file generates strongly typed code on both sides, making it impossible for the client and server to “disagree” about the shape or type of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is not limited to Dart: the exact same approach works seamlessly if your server is written in Go, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, C#, TypeScript, or any language supported by the Protobuf compiler. Protobuf acts as a shared contract, giving you end-to-end type safety and consistent, compact data serialization across your entire stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;However… JSON still keeps one important advantage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can decode Protobuf messages, of course—but unlike JSON, you don’t see human-readable field names. Instead, you see numeric field identifiers and wire types. The data is meaningful, but without the corresponding &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; schema you can only interpret it at a structural level, not semantically. You can see the fields, but you don’t know what they represent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Human-friendly debugging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JSON can be read and understood immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "isActive": true
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Protobuf payload, being binary, can’t be interpreted in a meaningful, human-readable way without knowing the schema behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1: 42
2: "Alice"
3: "alice@example.com"
4: true
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t prevent you from working with Protobuf, but it does add some complexity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;requires specialized tooling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;schemas must be maintained and versioned&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;decoding tools are essential&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, the trade-off is well worth it given the performance and efficiency benefits Protobuf provides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this article makes you want to try Protobuf. It’s an incredibly mature, extremely performant tool, but still too invisible in the world of public APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And even though Protobuf is often associated with gRPC, nothing forces you to use both. Protobuf can work independently, on any traditional HTTP API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;more performance,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;more robustness,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;fewer errors,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and a genuinely enjoyable development experience,&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;then I strongly encourage you to try Protobuf on your next project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
