    &lt;p&gt;Redwood Materials has long dominated EV battery recycling, but what if they could drain every last drop of energy from those batteries before recycling them? I talk with the company’s CTO, Colin Campbell, about Redwood Energy, a new division doing just that by deploying used batteries as grid-scale storage at a massive scale. This isn’t just a side project; it’s a plan to turn a massive wave of incoming used batteries into a key resource for the grid.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Text transcript:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi everybody, this is Volts for October 22, 2025, “Can ‘second life’ EV batteries work as grid-scale energy storage?” I’m your host, David Roberts. Redwood Materials started recycling lithium-ion batteries before it was cool, before it was profitable, and before there were very many lithium-ion batteries to speak of. In the five years since, it has grown and scaled to capture the overwhelming majority of the booming automotive-battery recycling market in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, it spun off a new division called Redwood Energy. The idea is simple: it is going to hook the EV batteries it receives up to large arrays that serve as grid-scale energy storage. That way, it can drain every last bit of useful life out of them before it recycles them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So-called “second life” batteries have been discussed for many, many years, but this is the first time they have been deployed at appreciable scale. Redwood has built an off-grid facility where 20 megawatts of solar panels are powering 63 megawatt-hours of second life batteries that feed into two one-megawatt data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to chat with the company’s CTO, Colin Campbell, about why Redwood hatched this initiative, how the costs of second life storage compare with the rest of the storage market, and how big he thinks this side of the business could ultimately get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All right then, with no further ado, Colin Campbell, welcome to Volts. Thank you so much for coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David, thanks so much for having me. Pleasure to be here with you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we jump in, let’s back up a little bit — I should have probably mentioned in the intro you are, in certain circles, semi-famous. Colin Campbell worked at Tesla for many, many years — 17 years — one of their lead engineers. So a big role in designing and growing Tesla. So maybe you could just say briefly what it is that pulled you over to this side of things?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I was really excited when I joined Redwood to take some of the same philosophies and approaches and really, how should we say it, sort of the ethical impetus that brought me to Tesla and to deploy it in another part of the world. So instead of in consumer devices, cars, in industrial and industry, in things like the metals markets, novel material manufacturing at scale in the US. These are things that I think we all feel have withered a little bit over the last 20, 30 years in the US, and there’s a tremendous opportunity to apply some of the same lessons that we used at Tesla to those industries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was it 2019 that Redwood got underway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when Redwood started, there were not that many EV batteries around. So you guys have been recycling all kinds. Basically just taking all lithium-ion batteries. Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah. If you’ve got a lithium-ion battery, we will recycle it for you. So we’ll take your AirPods, your toothbrush, we’ll take that laptop, cell phone, all the way up to EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When did automotive batteries become the majority of your input by volume?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is a good question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was it recent or was that early on?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would say the transition to EV batteries dominating what we received, it’s been in the last year or 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the front edge of a very large wave of batteries has begun to arrive?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, the wave is out there, it’s coming. The waters have finally started to arrive at the beach here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So then comes this idea — and I have to think that someone at Redwood has had this idea in the back of their minds for a while — this idea of you’re getting all these batteries and then you’re just sucking the life out of them before you recycle them. It seems quite logical, but it raises all kinds of questions. So the very first question, I think the most important, because people have been discussing second life batteries for a long time, and always the barrier that keeps people away from it is batteries are very heterogeneous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They come in. There are lots of different chemistries, there are lots of different wear and tear, states of wear and tear, how much life they have in them. You just get a huge variety of batteries. Making all those batteries work together has been the trick. And so when I heard this announcement from Redwood, I was like, “Oh my God, how’d they solve that problem?” And I went and looked and all it says on the site is, “Hey, we solved that problem.” So I’m very curious. Like, I thought that was an extremely difficult problem, but apparently you just hook all these different batteries up to this little box, this little box that you’re calling the universal translator, and voila, they all work together. So can you tell us a little bit about how you did that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple as that. Yes. No, you’re absolutely right. And the idea of a second life battery in a second life energy storage system has been out there for a long time. I think you nailed one piece of it, which was that we weren’t really seeing those batteries come back for, originally, recycling, and now for second life in appreciable volume until really recently. We know it’s inevitable that they’ll come back, but it just hadn’t started to happen yet. And the other thing that’s made this practical — and more than practical, a good business for us — is a couple of realizations we had.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So one is that electric vehicle batteries are incredibly robust, and grid-scale energy storage is a relatively pastoral life for those batteries — it’s really like putting the old horse out to pasture. So what that means is you don’t have to do much to them. They’re mechanically made for salt spray and vibration and being underwater, and they’re electrically made for fast charging, for merging onto the freeway, for high performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re very high-end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know that people understand, one, how high end they are, or two, how big they are — capacity-wise, they’re huge. And then there’s three, sort of how big they are physically. I mean, one of the things that sort of haunted me as I was reading about this, and this is for years, when I think automotive battery, my brain wants to think about the size and shape of the normal —&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;12-volt lead-acid guy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;12-volt battery, that square. And I was like, “Oh, those little square boxes. Well, those will be easy to stack.” But of course, an actual EV battery is this big, unwieldy, odd-shaped thing that is also heavy. You have to carry them around with forklifts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep. So because they’re so awkward and big, if you’re going to repurpose them and have a profitable business doing that, you really can’t spend a bunch of labor on it. So the important thing for us was, don’t disassemble it, don’t mess with it, really use it as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s key here. You’re not getting at the cells, you’re not tearing it down and using the cells, you’re just — it’s just the battery itself. You’re just plugging the battery itself, laying it on the ground and plugging it in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, there’s a little bit more magic to that, but that’s the core of it — do as little as possible, make it really, really simple to keep it cheap and resilient and flexible for the, what you said, the wide variety of packs that we get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we should say another barrier to making this business work was the incredible logistics involved in gathering batteries, which, of course, you guys are already doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s an underappreciated challenge of the recycling business, which is just gathering all the batteries. It’s an incredibly diverse and heterogeneous set of companies, set of individuals, set of utilities, and municipal agencies that collect them. And our commercial team has just crushed it, really, in making it so that all those batteries come to us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s the percentage now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s north of 70 or 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So is that 80% of the batteries that get recycled or do you think it’s 80% of all lithium-ion car batteries?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is of the lithium-ion batteries. So more than just car batteries that get recycled in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you’re the bulk of the recycling business. But you didn’t actually answer the core of the question, which is — I mean, I’m sure the actual answer is some sort of software gobbledygook that I wouldn’t understand — but what is it that made it possible for you, you guys, to figure this software out when other people have failed?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah. So there are two parts, like we said: One is this mechanical simplicity and the other is what you referred to earlier, this box that we’re calling a universal translator. So what is that? That is something that our really strong in-house power electronics team built. It is a way to make sure every one of these unique snowflakes of a pack gets individual care and feeding. So it’s a way to control the voltage, control the power for each pack, depending on its own unique state of health, its own unique state of charge. Also to talk the language of any pack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you’ve got 50 different pack manufacturers, they all talk 50 different languages, the content is kind of similar —&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was curious about that, are you sort of able to generalize at all or are you really sort of having, “Well, here’s NMC language. We got to program that in.” Is there any sort of commonality among batteries or is it really just bespoke, you got to program every single individual one in there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s pretty bespoke. The content is the same. All battery packs want to talk about is cell voltages, cell temperatures, and pack currents. But the languages are pretty different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that’s been a real effort and a real successful effort by our software team to abstract that away and make it so that at the high level we just have a battery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I’m curious just how agnostic it is. Can you say with confidence that any EV battery on the market, if you wear it out in your car, you can plug it into this thing? Is that categorical?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s never, never 100%. But we’ve put a lot of effort into making sure we’re in the high 90s. So this universal translator that we built, it’s ready for battery packs anywhere from 200 to 900 volts, for example. So we know more modern cars are higher voltage, semi trucks are higher voltage, Cybertrucks are higher voltage. And then also we’re agnostic to chemistry, so LFP, high nickel, we can take it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is just wild. So congrats to your software team. It actually raises the question, which is, I’m wondering, like, how modular is this? It seems like the box, the software is the key thing. So if I, for whatever reason, had one of these boxes and I’m like, I don’t know, I run an automotive garage or something and I just happen to have three or four spare EV batteries in my backyard, could I hook them together and treat them like one battery, just using this thing? Like how, how small can it get, I guess is the question?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, you hypothetically could. I’d never thought about it, to be honest. But there’s no reason you couldn’t make a 200 kilowatt-hour site using this same piece of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it’ll scale down as far as you would ever want?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will. I’ll say that’s not the question we most commonly get. Usually people want to know how big can you go and how fast can you go?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, we’ll get there. But you know, I love me some distributed energy, so I’d love to think about who could do this on site, basically. So you get the batteries and you assess them presumably to see if they’re suitable for this. Sort of like, what’s the criteria and how many batteries make it through?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, the assessment, I think it’s less of an intense torture test than most people imagine. And the reason for that is you don’t need that much cycle life out of a used battery in order for it to make economic sense to put it into service. So you don’t really need perfect understanding of its state of health. You just need to know it’s good enough. And so that’s something — we’ve built some specialized hardware to do that. It’s less than a minute per battery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, so you get it, you plug it in, you get a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red light, green light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And how many batteries get sort of rejected versus accepted, do you know?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do know. I’ll have to say we’re constitutionally sort of incapable of rejecting things. So first pass, it’s high 90s that we’re accepting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, so most batteries then will have some juice left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most batteries are good enough, and that doesn’t mean they’re great, but they’re really good enough to deploy. And then we’re always looking at that fraction that got rejected and just saying, “How can we squeeze a little bit more utility out of those?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe this comparison you don’t have in the top of your head, but relatively speaking, for a given battery, say an NMC battery, what is the value of this remaining capacity you’re getting out of them versus the value of the metals that you recover out of them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, well, obviously it varies and we’re learning, but equal to or greater and maybe several times greater.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, interesting. So this is not a marginal bit of value creation. Then you’re getting, you’re 2x-ing the value you get out of these batteries by doing this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something like that. Which is like, “Oh my goodness, look at this utility that we were rushing into the recycler. Let’s go and take a detour and capture it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right, right. So tell me just a little bit about, from an engineering perspective, how you design a system when you know that these batteries, let’s say relative to a typical grid-scale battery installation, you’re going to be mucking with these a lot more. You’re going to be adding them and removing them more frequently than a typical battery installation. How do you design around that to try to keep that cost — because I’ll just say up front, like when I first heard about this, and I’m sure a lot of people say this, like my first thought is just like, “That just sounds like a lot of logistics, like a lot of people, a lot of forklifts, a lot of space, just a lot of logistics.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it must be clear to you that you’re getting more value out of it than the logistics. But how are you trying to minimize the logistics of being this active — taking things in and out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, well, the short answer, and maybe not that helpful, is you design for it. So you know that you’re going to have to swap packs more often than in a brand new energy storage site with new cells. And so you provision for that in your design. So, yeah, there’s some small amount of forklift traffic. You make sure it’s really simple to access packs, that it’s really simple for an operator to connect and disconnect packs, to lift them, to move them. And I think one piece of this that is related to that is that these sites are slightly lower energy density than maybe a brand new purpose-built energy storage site. And that really eases service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you mean? Like, what do you mean safety-wise?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, no, just in terms of the megawatt-hours per acre. They’re a little more spread out, and part of that is service and planning for service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you just have to literally physically lay them on the ground. You have to space them out enough that you can get to them, basically?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s actually — I think of it less as a requirement of second life energy storage and it’s more one about like what is the value of a really dense energy storage site? For some sites it’s really important: if you’re in a city, if you’re close to some infrastructure where land is expensive, it’s really important. But in many, many sites it’s less important and you would actually get a lower cost dollars per kilowatt-hour installed with less energy density. And that was one important realization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of lower labor costs, because of easier — it’s just easier to use, easier to update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just simpler. The closer you pack cells together, the more careful you have to be because they do contain energy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, let’s talk about safety then. Because I was going to get to that later, but I’m assuming that, like, because these are spaced out so widely and they’re just sort of individually attached, it’s kind of difficult for me to imagine any sort of large-scale fire or any danger really. Is there safety? What is the, what are the safety considerations here?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So top of the list for us, of course, designing this thing is safety. And our guiding light has always been passive safety. So if you do have a fire for whatever reason, that it stops on its own, that no fire response is needed, no sprinklers are needed, you’re absolutely welcome to. We encourage people to do that, but it’s not necessary. So it’s a passive feature of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this individual battery that’s hooked up could theoretically catch on fire, burn up, and be done — and that’s it. And who cares, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s exactly right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Has that happened? Have you had any thermal runaways yet? I’m always curious what the actual percentage of that happening is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, we haven’t. It’s really rare. I mean, it’s impactful and it’s important when it does. And I think Moss Landing in particular really sticks in everyone’s imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It really does. That’s why I have to ask this question anytime I talk to a battery company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah. And that’s real. That was a real — that was a bad outcome. But we are designed to avoid anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How long have you had enough batteries come through yet that you’re able to generalize about kind of what you’re getting out of them? Like, what is the average lifespan of one of these?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, we really don’t know, to be frank. But what we do know is that it’s long enough to be a good business, that if we deploy them for a year, for 500 cycles, something like that, that makes sense. And we know that that’s well within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But presumably this little box is recording lots of information about these. So you are gathering tons of data, presumably tons of data about the performance of these used batteries?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, absolutely. I think we’re going to be the clearinghouse for what actually happens at the end of life for EV packs. But it takes a long time. They’re pretty robust. So even after you have rightfully retired one from your car for being slow and having a short range, there are many, many, many years of capacity remaining at that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;80% is like the typical industry — that’s where you sort of cut off the EV battery usefulness. When it gets down to 80%?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s a norm. Depends on the customer. It’s really their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, but 80% is a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You sort of already answered this, but I’ll ask it anyway: So right now you’re going to places where land is not at a particular premium. And so there’s no real reason not to spread out, as you say. You might even get a little better unit economics spreading out more. I wonder, do you expect all future second life grid-scale storage to be in places where land is not a premium? Because what I’m wondering is, are there engineering ways to get them closer together? Could you ever figure out how to stack them? Like, they are very spread out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And like the first thing that came to mind was, if this becomes really valuable and really common, somebody is going to figure out how to squish them closer together. Is that something you think about at all?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do think about it and we in fact have already done it. So our architecture is flexible, so we really work with our customer to understand the value of density to them. And if it’s high, then we can provide a much denser product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do it. Is there stacking? Can you stack them at all? Go vertical at all? Because this is the thing, they just spread out horizontally. And I can’t help thinking, if you could just go up a couple of stories, you could fit so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah. There are a bunch of different ways to do it, and it just starts to get a little more complicated. You’ve got to build the tower for them to live in and figure out how to get them in and out. It’s all possible. It all makes sense in certain circumstances, but not all. So we work with the people who are buying these to figure out what makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is the idea here that you will be the developer and the owner of the battery in all cases, or are you selling, will someone else own and operate them? What’s the business model exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, this industry, there’s probably every business model under the sun available, and we’re open to pretty much all of them. The one thing that is important to us is that we recycle the packs. That’s part of our mission. It’s part of what we think is important to do in North America, and we intend to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that sort of suggests that the model that makes the most sense is for you to just be sort of having them and owning them and running them the whole time. Or is the idea that you could ship a bunch of these to a separate site, they set up one of these, and then they ship them back to your facility when they’re done with them, but they own them while they’re in the battery?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s — I’m not trying to be cute — you could imagine a million different ways to structure that sort of contractual relationship. And in the end, the batteries, we still would like to receive them for recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess it’s more like the physics or logistics of it. I’m sort of wondering about. Because doing this right next to the plant where they’re recycled makes just a ton of sense. Obviously, there’s very little logistics, but once you have one of these set up in a spot that is remote from the recycling facility, then the fact that packs are coming in and out frequently becomes a little bit more of an issue. Because then you have a sort of a supply chain between you and a remote facility. That doesn’t daunt you at all?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to think about it. But this is not like rail cars and rail cars of packs going back and forth, even from a giant energy storage site. It’s like a few. And at the beginning, while we are really pioneering this and doing it for the first time — I think it makes total sense for us to do it ourselves. And we will. But I don’t think that’s necessary long term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So one of the claims your CEO J. B. Straubel makes in his sort of introductory video is that this is going to be cheaper than grid-scale storage with new lithium-ion batteries. And I guess the calculation there is — on one hand, your business model works as is. So you have the batteries from the perspective of this new division basically for free. Like they’re already there. You’re already gathering them. So in a sense, even if they’re lower quality than new batteries, they’re just sitting there. So, in a sense they’re cheaper that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, you have all this logistics, you have all these forklifts and trucks and setting up and the space and site and everything else. So I’m just wondering how the costs balance out. Is there an easy comparison between a new second life battery and a brand new battery? Like a cost comparison?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think as you pointed out, the cost of energy is low compared to a brand new battery because it’s degraded, it’s been out in the world, it’s not a fresh battery. The balance of system, we’re actually making really important strides there too. So the power electronics, the mechanical assembly, there’s a lot of cost in these sites around what people call the EPC cost — engineering, procurement, construction — civil works, getting the batteries plugged in, wiring the whole thing up. And we spent and are spending a lot of time optimizing sort of the rest of the cost stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So not just leaning on the fact that our energy is relatively low cost because it is second life energy, but really pushing hard on power electronics. We have that whole team in-house. Push down the dollars per watt of power electronics, make it a really, really simple, really, really robust thing to deploy. And that’s underappreciated about what we’re up to — it’s not just that the batteries are cheaper, the whole system is simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, that’s, I mean, it’s the whole system that first jumped up when I started reading about this. Like obviously that’s where, like, you found an incredibly cheap source of batteries, i.e. a big pile of batteries you already had in your backyard. But like, it’s all, all the costs are the logistics and the balance of system stuff. So you think you have running room there to bring those costs down substantially?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you can claim that you are beating a new lithium-ion grid-scale battery storage system on the sort of per kilowatt-hour basis already?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, we can, and that’s installed over life. So there’s a little bit of pack replacement that has to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you have a number? What are you pitching to people when you’re trying to sell this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do have a number, but it’s enough to make it a really good, great business, I think, is what I will say here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but like, sort of legendarily, a new lithium-ion battery grid-scale storage — they sort of will do four hours, some of them will do eight hours. Some people now are pushing the economics because batteries are getting cheaper. They’re pushing the economics out to maybe 12 hours at the outer edge. If your unit costs are that much cheaper, how — what kind of durations do you think you can get given your cheaper system?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve actually nailed it there. So because energy is cheaper, the balance of plant, which we are making great progress on, like power electronics, the cost of power starts to become more important. And so we have a real advantage for eight-hour and beyond energy storage. We can play and compete and win at 2-hour and 4-hour on total installed cost over life. But it starts to look really compelling at the longer durations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, interesting. Can you do 24 hours? The Holy Grail. Could you make something baseload out of this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely. The original modeling that we did for this was around a 24-hour system. Turning renewables into baseload. Looks really good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been told by many very confident-sounding people, Colin, that that’s impossible. So you say you did it. So do you envision the next plant you build and the next one after that — do you envision hooking these up to the grid and having them sort of make money off providing services to the grid, arbitrage, frequency, et cetera, et cetera? Or do you primarily envision doing what you’ve done with this first installation, which is going off-grid? You got solar panels, you got batteries, you got data centers. It’s all hooked up together, it’s all self-contained and running on its own, and does not need one of these very difficult-to-get grid connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which model do you think is going to dominate?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are going to do all of the above. We can and we are doing sites for grid services. Just plug a battery into the grid and help support the grid by participating in the market. We have other “microgrids.” They’re not so micro anymore. They’re many, many, many megawatts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go ahead and brag. This one you built? Yeah, it’s Nevada. I forget — it’s the biggest microgrid in America? You are claiming North America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the largest microgrid in North America and it’s the largest second-energy storage site in the world. So that’s like you said at the top, it’s a 12-megawatt AC, 63-megawatt-hour grid supporting about 2 or 3 megawatts of data centers and run by solar. So all the energy comes from another 12 megawatts of solar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the grid does not touch it. There’s no transmission grid connection at all?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s exactly right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What a beautiful thing. I’ve also been confidently told that those things don’t work economically. Exciting that it is working. And you’ve probably answered this already. But in terms of grid services, you hook one of these things up to the grid, there’s nothing that new batteries can do that these batteries can’t do, right? In terms of frequency regulation and all this kind of stuff. Grid forming, whatever. The kind of things that the batteries and inverters can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Virtual inertia, all of that. I mean, one of the things that is very topical right now is the data center market, of course, like a giant increase in the demand for power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there’s just this beautiful symbiosis between energy storage and data centers. Sort of no matter what your primary source of power is. So much of it is the, there’s already huge racks of batteries and uninterruptible power supplies inside the data center. Already these big diesel generators. We can make both of those things obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you now have two little data centers running. I mean, the data center company technology that you’re using at this site is also pretty interesting on its own merits. But they’re building basically what they call modular data centers. And I’ve been wondering when someone’s going to do this because everybody, it’s kind of the same arc nuclear went on at first. Everybody’s like economies of scale. Economies of scale. Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, big, big, big. And you’re getting these data centers now that are like small cities, like gigawatt-plus data centers. And I have part of this podcast premise to hunt great faith in modularity and repeatability and manufacturability competing against those economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this company is making data centers at this site in Nevada, is making these basically like containerized, modularized data centers. Like a 1-megawatt data center with all the power, electronics, cooling, etc., contained in the box, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s our partner Crusoe, we love them, they’re super smart and they’re doing exactly what you’re talking about, which is: how do we drive down the cost of a data center? We mass-manufacture it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mass manufacture and distribute so it’ll be distributed just like everything else. And then you can wedge a little bit of data centering here and a little bit of data centering there rather than having to look for a mega site. But anyway, that’s probably a whole separate pod on its own. But yeah, but again, so there’s — so you could, in terms of building these sort of like off-grid, self-contained solar plus battery plus use — whoever’s in that use, that could be any manufacturing, be a factory, be anything?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could be anyone who needs power. So data center is obviously top of the list right now. You can go set up a data center quite quickly and run it off solar and storage while you wait for your grid interconnection. If you’re planning to put a natural gas turbine, while you wait for that turbine to show up, those are actually — can be at the power levels we’re talking about, they can take a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we can help sort of blaze the trail. And then there’s really a tremendous amount of utility and, like I said, symbiosis between data centers and energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, just speed too, right? Like the top — you know this — the top thing hyperscalers are saying, the top thing data centers want is speed to market. They hardly care about the cost, they just want to get hooked up, time to power. And I’m guessing, tell me if I’m wrong, but I’m guessing you can build one of these things, a solar field and a battery field attached to a manufacturing facility, faster than any large-scale centralized power plant. Is that —&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is turning out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How fast? Do you have a number yet? You’ve only built one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean it obviously depends so much on scale, but 12 months, 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How long did it take to build the one you built?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, the one we built from empty dirt pad to fully commissioned was like four months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What?! A four-month timeline for a fully operational 24/7 power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where the simplicity of install is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, so again, you’re pushing away at that, the balance of system, the speed, etc. But again, already four months is just wildly faster than anything else available. Have you learned anything — I mean, this thing, this one you’ve got running has only been running for two, three months. It’s relatively new, so I’m sure there’s lots more to learn. But have you learned anything about the performance of these things in the field? Like, are you getting data that is updating any of your priors? Is anything surprising you about what’s actually happening out there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, no surprises. So we’re confirming a lot of the things that we had modeled out. We have a really excellent physics-based modeling team. So I’ll give you one example. A lot of EV batteries are liquid cooled. So if you are driving around in your electric car, your cells are cooled by fluid that runs through a radiator. And we don’t use that system because of the complexity that’s associated with pumps and pipes and fluids and all of those things. And we now know for a fact that that is absolutely fine in the middle of the desert in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So most of the overheating probably comes from being contained in a hot car over hot pavement. In that environment, they just won’t overheat if you’re sitting them out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s really about the rate that we are pushing power into them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, I see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if we’re discharging, say at the fastest, over two hours, that’s pretty chill for a battery compared to showing up at a supercharger and trying to fill it in 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, this is out to pasture again. These are old horses that are being treated gently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it’s working exactly as we expected it to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you’re not worried at all that in the fullness of time, because batteries, new batteries are legendarily rapidly falling in cost, you’re not worried at all that at some point that process is going to undercut your economics. Do you think you’re going to stay ahead of that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, well, I think a used battery is always going to be cheaper than a new one. I’m pretty confident in that. And the other piece of it is what I talked about a little bit earlier. We’re not sitting still on the non-battery parts. So we’re really, we have a great team, power electronics, mechanical engineering, software, all of that pushing down the cost of all the things that aren’t the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there a future where you include other kinds of non-automotive batteries in this system? Like, is there another kind of battery that has enough juice in it to make it worth the squeeze?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think so. I mean, we’re pretty agnostic to battery type. So it really comes down to sort of acquisition cost, in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m just sort of assuming that like a toothbrush battery is just not going to be worth getting the human to walk out there and plug it in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me backpedal. I don’t think ever that you’ll see like a matrix-like field of AirPods or toothbrushes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s the general cutoff? Like a weed whacker battery, like how big before...?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know, but I bet somewhere in the like 10 to 14 kilowatt-hour range, somewhere in there it’ll start to make sense. So maybe light hybrids, but not weed whackers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And not toothbrushes. So in terms of the logistics of gathering the batteries, I’m assuming that’s all already up and running. That’s what you’ve been doing for the last few years. Is your ability to do this with the batteries going to change that side of things — how you gather them? I know there’s some sort of partnership with GM, it’s a little vague on the website, exactly what that consists of. What is that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I think we’ve really put more effort into exactly those kinds of partnerships with automakers who sometimes have the packs at their end of life and need a place to send them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do they, though? Why would they, like, why would GM end up with used GM batteries?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, sometimes. So some, some packs —&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m so curious, what happens to a battery — like if my battery runs out, I go to a — I don’t know, a mechanic or whatever and get a new one. I have no idea what happens to it. Tell us just a little bit about what that looks like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything under the sun happens to it. So if it’s a dealer, then that’s one, like, pretty consistent path. If it’s a shop, your local EV service shop, it’s actually been a challenge for them. And it’s one thing that, well before this energy storage business started, that we’ve been working hard to make as easy as possible. So we actually have sort of a — I don’t know what you want to call it, like a reverse Amazon — to make it super easy to send big batteries like this to us to figure out what they’re worth and get them on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So they mail them to you, basically, they ship them to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interesting. And that — I don’t know, that just seems so expensive when I think about it. Again, so much logistics. It’s amazing how much logistics is involved in your business model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logistics is a real thing. It’s also remarkable how efficient it is to move mass around. Transportation costs for a battery are not a giant piece of the concern. It’s really the complexity of just like there’s a million places these end up — junkyards, people’s houses, dealerships, everything you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the GM partnership, the newer GM partnership? It caught my eye, and the reason I ask about it is because I thought it would just be them getting you their old batteries. But it also says something in the press release about them maybe sending you new batteries also to be included in these power plants. So I was wondering about that — if there would ever be any reason for new batteries to wander into this milieu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, well, maybe a couple things. GM’s been tremendously collaborative with us as we embark on the second life project. And we appreciate that. It’s very helpful to have their support as we do it. And then not specific to GM, but you do have to ask yourself the question “Why do these batteries have to be used?” And if we can do a good enough job on the balance of system costs, then they don’t. That’s not our focus right now, but it’s something that definitely is on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interesting. So theoretically, you could end up being just a very competitive grid storage company that is agnostic to the source of batteries?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someday, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing that we’re getting good at right now, and it’s still — it’s still early days, I want to emphasize that for us — is being uniquely capable of integrating all of these zillion different battery types. So this, like, heterogeneity is something that we’re really good at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which raises a question I’ve had about Redwood forever. Recycling really forever. Now that you are big enough to sort of throw your weight around a little bit, you’re a big player in this market. Have you initiated any kind of talks with battery designers and manufacturers about trying to get batteries to be designed more for recyclability on the front end? And now that I think about it too, that would probably — like, the more sort of uniform they get and the easier to recycle it gets, I feel like that would also have the effect of making them easier to do this with, to integrate into these things with. Are you at all trying to influence the design of batteries on the front end?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a great question. And I confronted that a little bit in my prior life where I was designing EV battery packs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think Tesla’s actually famous for designing batteries that are very not that. They’re very integrated into the car. They’re very — not particularly recyclable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll say a couple things about that. One is, when you’re doing things the way that we need to do them to make an impact in the world at industrial scale, having packs be disassembled by hand or even with automation, the sort of design for recyclability, that’s pretty expensive. And so I think the recycling processes that win are going to be something that is at least philosophically like backing up a truck full of packs and like dumping them into a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you physically disassembling all the batteries now? Before you recycle them in the recycling process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I try not to. I try to send them into energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You hire people to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But no, our processes don’t require a great deal of disassembly because every pack is different, and I think every pack is rightfully different in order to make a great car or a great truck or whatever it is, it’s hard to make those things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you think standardization is going to happen on the recycling end, not on the design end, basically?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think so. And I think the processes for separating out all of the metals that are contained in a pack are going to work fine, regardless of how the pack was built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah, I need to do another pod just on the recycling stuff. By way of wrapping up, let’s look out a little bit into the future. When I brought this up online, a lot of people’s first reaction was, “Well, that seems like kind of a boutique distraction from the core business that Redwood’s in.” And the more I looked into it, I was like, “Well, there’s like two gazillion batteries on the way to recycling.” Again, we’re just at the front end of this. They’re just sort of trickling in now, I guess you’d say, in what is going to become a flood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you could see this growing and expanding quite a bit. I just wonder how you see this division relative to the recycling division. I mean, you sort of touched on this earlier. Do you think this will be, in the fullness of time, a comparably sized part of the business or even bigger than the recycling part?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely. There’s plenty of batteries out there in the world that are going to need to be reused. Like you — you hit on it. It’s like, what is North American EV pack production per year today? It’s 100 gigawatt-hours, 150 gigawatt-hours per year. And then the entire storage, I think, deployed last year in the US was — was half of that. So, the EV market is, for the moment, quite big compared to the storage market. They’re both growing, but —&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EVs are growing faster. I mean, I’m assuming EVs are always going to dwarf stationary storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Storage is catching up. I think it’s about a quarter of the cells in the US that go into storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really? That’s bigger than I would have guessed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the point is there’s plenty of used packs. We know that it’s inevitable they’re going to come back. So that’s to the like, is it a boutique distraction? No, I think it’s a real durable business. And to the question, is it a distraction? We are still quite committed to the metals business. I think that’s still so exciting and so important to bring back to North America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this does seem like, to me at least, this seems just to fit right in. Like in a sense, it’s almost like a version of recycling. You’re sort of recycling power. You’re recycling the power before you recycle the metals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was trying to think about how to say this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in the same way, you’re preventing new stuff from having to be made. I mean, in a sense, in both cases, you’re preventing the necessity for new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I mean, the need for new stuff is gigantic. And so in order to fuel a complete electrification of the economy, there’s still a lot of new stuff we’re going to need, but we can in the short term blunt that a little bit and make it cheaper by extracting really every last drop of utility, whether it be energy storage capacity, whether it be the metals out of old things. And then if you fast forward 100 years, like it’ll all be circular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this is, especially in these depressing current times. These are among, among the places I go, my happy places is thinking about this 100-year time horizon and total circularity. And it’s interesting to think how this fits into that picture, basically. You can imagine a world of full circularity vis-à-vis metals, right, where we no longer are having to dig up any new metals, basically. We’ve reached a steady state. We’re perfectly recycling all the metals that come through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can. The thing I want to emphasize is that that also just makes economic sense. It is a cheaper way to provide nickel and lithium in addition to being sort of lower carbon and all of the other things that circularity provides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. Less grim labor implications, all that kind of stuff as well. But I was sort of thinking about how this fits into that. Like if you’re getting all the world’s batteries and recycling them and you’re sucking all this capacity out of them before you recycle them, you’re also like, that’s a big, potentially a big chunk of the energy storage we need. I don’t know if anybody’s tried to do this kind of math, like 20 years out or whatever, 50 years out. Like what, what sort of — like how much of the stationary storage market in the US do you think could ultimately be served by second life batteries?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all napkin math, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a good question. So today we can serve like 10, 15% of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really? Already with the batteries you’re receiving today?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, so we’re receiving something like 5 gigawatt-hours a year. And I think the US put 50 into service this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5 gigawatt-hours a year. And this plant you built, we should say, this off-grid plant, it’s like 63, not, it’s not even 100 megawatt-hours. So to really scale this up to start matching the input, that’s just going to be a lot of land, isn’t it? You’re not worried at all about the land?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, this is like, this is a version of “Am I worried about the land use of solar?” And no, turns out you get a lot of, a lot of energy density coming from the sun. A lot of power density, sorry. And if you look at the size of — we can even look at our pilot plant in Nevada. If you look at the size of the battery compared to the size of the solar array, it’s 1/10 the size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1/10?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, and that’s, we could do better. We could do 1/20 or 1/30 if we wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, so you can shrink down the size of the battery thing. Can’t really shrink down the size of the solar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, exactly. So, it’s not that big.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So for the off-grid applications, it would be the generation. That would be the land, the real land issue, not so much the batteries. What’s next? We pull our view out from 100 years out to say five. What’s next? What’s the next plant? Do you imagine being sort of the owner and developer of the next few of these as you kind of prove them out and show they can work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s next is much bigger projects. So we have several of those lined up already in the 5 to 10 and bigger x the one we put in Nevada. So substantially bigger than our pilot site in Nevada. And so we’re really focused on executing those and delivering those.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And are those in Nevada?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really? I think of the vast west desert as where you find these big swaths of cheap land. Are you building — you have your eye on the east coast, the northeast, congested areas too?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have projects — I’m sort of like doing the Rolodex in my head here — not quite everywhere in the country, but not just in the desert west, to your point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interesting. And I’m sure some of this is confidential, but for the projects in your pipeline, are they all off-grid, attached to solar in some sort of manufacturing facility, or are some of them going to be grid-connected?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of them will be grid connected. Like if you can imagine a place where somebody has put a utility-scale battery, we have a project like that. We have grid-connected grid arbitrage. We have behind the meter, front of the meter. We have paired with manufacturing, paired with renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any energy storage plays, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly. Same energy storage as any other kind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I think about the logistics, new things keep coming to mind. But in terms of your battery gathering, how many sites do you have where you’re gathering batteries? Because wherever you build one of these, you are establishing basically an ongoing relationship to some source of these batteries, right? A supply chain. You’re going to have to have batteries continually shipped between where they’re gathered and where you have this plant. How many of those battery gathering sites are there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As this becomes a national project for us, we need sort of regional warehousing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it all in the one Nevada plant at this point?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not. We also have a big site that we’re developing and actually just opened our first recycling plant there in South Carolina. So that’s a strategic spot for us on the east coast, near a port, near a lot of industry. And that’s another logical place for us to inventory this stuff. But I imagine, in the fullness of time, we will put them where it makes sense to support these customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just keep trying to wrap my head around the shift that you are about to undergo. Like right now you say you got 5 gigawatt-hours a year of batteries incoming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gigawatt-hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep, gigawatt-hours, sorry. I’m assuming that the line is going up and to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, it is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How fast per year? Like, what’s next year? How steep is that line? I mean, I’m assuming it’s just going to get real steep relatively soon. But I don’t know if you’ve actually charted it out and plotted it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s a little hard to predict, but we’ve seen 50% year-on-year growth at the beginning of this wave. And you can look back at the beginning of EV manufacturing in 2012 in volume. What was the ramp rate? And we’re going to see something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interesting. So we’re going to go from like 5, 10. Like having 100 GWh of batteries coming through is not crazy. Not out of the...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I mean, you can almost just predict it. We’re making 100 gigawatt-hours today, so in 10 years we’ll be seeing those come back ready for second life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so then I just, at that level of volume, getting more power out of them will in no way be a small thing. I think this is what J. B. Straubel was kind of trying to get at in his big talk — this may look like a side thing today, but it’s going to be enormously important. If you’ve got 100 gigawatt-hours coming through, that’s a lot of power to just be throwing away. So it’s just going to be a lot more significant in five years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It really will. So we are laying the groundwork for this. This team knows how to build things at scale. We have done it before. The business and the power electronics, the mechanical bits that we’re designing for energy storage, they’re all designed for mass manufacture, for simple assembly in the field. Because we know that this is coming — tens and hundreds of gigawatts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I love to see someone getting ahead of the puck. As I look around these days at US politics, it’s nice to see someone anticipating what’s going to happen and getting ready before it happens. Just a beautiful thing to witness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you. We’re having fun. We love finding something valuable that hasn’t been extracted and going after it. And this is just another example of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s just a bunch of puzzles. I mean, all this second life stuff is just an enormous logistical puzzle to solve. And solving puzzles is fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Roberts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin, thanks so much for coming on and talking us through this. Really interesting. I think it’s a lot bigger of a deal than it sort of appears on the surface. So it was fun to — fun to dig in a little bit with you. Thanks for coming on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So fun to be here. Great questions. Really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Date bug affects Ubuntu 25.10 automatic updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ubuntu Project has announced that a bug in the Rust-based uutils version of the date command shipped with Ubuntu 25.10 broke automatic updates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some Ubuntu 25.10 systems have been unable to automatically check for available software updates. Affected machines include cloud deployments, container images, Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server installs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement includes remediation instructions for those affected by the bug. Systems with the rust-coreutils package version 0.2.2-0ubuntu2 or earlier have the bug, it is fixed in 0.2.2-0ubuntu2.1 or later. It does not impact manual updates using the apt command or other utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ubuntu embarked on a project to "oxidize" the distribution by switching to uutils and sudo-rs for the 25.10 release, and to see if the Rust-based utilities would be suitable for the long-term-release slated for next April. LWN covered that project in March.&lt;/p&gt;

These utilities are done, the specifications do not change, or change very little. The only valid reason might be a future situation, where support for the C language starts disappearing, which is totally a fantasy scenario. C is too entrenched for that to happen within the expected lifetime of our technical civilisation.

These tools need maintenance and rewriting them in something with a saner build system than C has to offer after being around for 50 years certainly will make this easier. As for C not disappearing, it feels like we are already in an era where most young people below the age of 35-40 or so do not learn it any more so you might be surprised how quickly the pool of potential volunteer maintainers will deplete for boring, mature C projects. Posted Oct 24, 2025 8:48 UTC (Fri) by alx.manpages (subscriber, #145117) [Link] I'm 32, and I went to university with people 7 years younger than me, and C was still the main language we studied there. I've heard that some schools have reduced the amount of C courses, but it's still there. &amp;gt; so you might be surprised how quickly the pool of potential volunteer maintainers will deplete for boring, mature C projects. While the number of people knowing C enough might reduce, it might also increase the ratio of C programmers that know C very well. Self-selection can be a good thing. I don't expect the amount of C experts to diminish significantly. &amp;gt; These tools need maintenance and rewriting them in something with a saner build system than C has to offer after being around for 50 years certainly will make this easier. C has evolved quite a lot in these 50 years, and I'm not sure Rust is better than C. Most of the issues people complain about C are in reality issues with old C, or low quality compilers. Some issues remain in the latest GCC, but there's work on having an even better C in the following years. Incremental improvements are better than entirely jumping to a new language, and this issue with Rust's date(1) is an example of why we should keep improving the C version, which is almost bug-free, instead of writing bugs in a different language. &amp;lt;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-shou...&amp;gt; Posted Oct 23, 2025 21:12 UTC (Thu) by pixelbeat (guest, #7440) [Link] (7 responses) Then there are fundamental issues with SIGPIPE handling in all the uutils https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/8919 Also there are questionable interface changes being added like 12 ways to get a sha3 https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/8984 I wish them well, but this needs to be carefully managed.

Posted Oct 23, 2025 22:00 UTC (Thu) by geofft (subscriber, #59789) [Link] (2 responses) Looks like this was originally reported in https://pad.lv/2127970 on October 16, exactly one week ago and also exactly one week after Ubuntu 25.10's release. The reporter originally mentioned the bug in the context of a homegrown backup script that was failing silently, and they got the fix into the proposed stable update repository yesterday, with an (understandable) argument about why it wasn't same-day levels of urgent. This morning, someone pointed out that it breaks unattended-upgrades. It seems to me that it was only at this point that it was tracked as a security issue, and the package is now available in both the (prod) stable updates repository and the more minimal security updates repository. The actual bug itself is simply that support for `date -r &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;` wasn't implemented. The issue https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/8621 and the pull request implementing support https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/pull/8630 were both filed on the same day, September 12 of this year, and it was reviewed and merged into main two days later. This, understandably, postdates whichever release Ubuntu snapshotted. I think I am mostly surprised that the command silently accepted -r and did nothing, and indeed from the actual diff (https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/commit/88a7fa7adfa048...) it's pretty clear that the argument parser had support for it but it wasn't wired up to do anything. If the command had instead returned an argument parsing error, I think this would have been caught a lot quicker. It does seem a little bit odd that whoever implemented this in the argument parser didn't at least add an "if -r, throw 'todo'" case. But it's also interesting that this was not statically caught. The Rust compiler is pretty good at warning and complaining about unused variables. (To be fair, most C compilers and many other languages are too, though anecdotally these warnings seem less noisy in Rust and I've seen more codebases in Rust where this is a hard failure than C codebases using -Werror. Also, Rust has #[must_use], if you want to be thorough.) However, there wasn't actually an unused variable here; you can see that you get the value out of the parsed-arguments object by asking for the value of the flag. I wonder if it's worth thinking about an argument-parsing API in Rust that would raise an unused-variable warning at compile time if a parsed command-line flag or argument is never used in the code. It might also be possible to do this with the existing parser with a sufficiently clever linter. Either way, the lack of compile-time detection of this bug feels at odds with the philosophy of a Rust rewrite of coreutils, i.e., that there's merit in having tools do the checking instead of trusting and expecting people to write perfect code. I also think it would be very much worth it for Ubuntu and the uutils developers to manually do an audit for all arguments that are parsed in an argument parser but not actually implemented. If this pattern happened once, it likely isn't the only case.

Perhaps this is a performance consideration, as all uutils have a larger startup overhead than their GNU equivalents, due mainly to the large multicall binary being used (due to rust binaries being significantly larger).

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Portrait of a Man with Glasses I, Francis Bacon, 1963&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This essay can be read as a complement to last year’s “How to think in writing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts die the moment they are embodied in words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;—Schopenhauer&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;1.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 1940s, when the French mathematician Jacques Hadamard asked good mathematicians how they came up with solutions to hard problems, they nearly universally answered that they didn’t think in words; neither did they think in images or equations. Rather, what passed through the mathematicians as they struggled with problems were such things as vibrations in their hands, nonsense words in their ears, or blurry shapes in their heads.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hadamard, who had the same types of experiences, wrote in The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field that this mode of thinking was distinct from daydreaming, and that most people, though they often think wordlessly, have never experienced the kind of processing that the mathematicians did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I read this, in December 2024, all sorts of questions arose in me. First of all, what does it even mean? Do they not think in words and equations at all? And secondly, how do I square this with my personal experience, which is that whenever I write what I think about a subject, it always turns out that my thoughts do not hold up on paper? No matter how confident I am in my thoughts, they reveal themselves on the page as little but logical holes, contradictions, and non sequiturs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recognize myself when Paul Graham writes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reason I’ve spent so long establishing [that writing helps you refine your thinking] is that it leads to another [point] that many people will find shocking. If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn’t written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How come Hadamard’s colleagues are able to have productive thoughts, working in their heads, without words, sometimes, for days on end?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tense subconscious processing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hadamard’s book is most famous for its detailed discussion of what Henri Poincaré called the “sudden illumination”—the moment when the solution to a problem emerges “in the shower” unexpectedly after a long period of unconscious incubation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hypothesis here is that if you work hard on a problem, you soak your subconscious with it. Wrestling with a problem helps you build a mental model of what you know and what you don’t—providing the subconscious with building blocks to work with. (You can’t have genuine intuition and inspiration in areas where you lack knowledge.) Then, once you drop the problem from conscious thought and go take care of the dishes or something, the subconscious begins a silent and parallelized search, trying many, many alternatives (in a somewhat random fashion), until something snaps in place. When this happens, the solution bubbles back up to the conscious mind, as if out of nowhere, making you freeze mid-motion with a stack of dirty plates in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very useful thing to know about the mind, because it means you can steer your subconscious towards the particular problems you want it to work on. By priming yourself with important problems before doing the dishes or going for walks or sleeping, you make sure your mental resources are used on what matters for you, instead of, for example, the open loops in a Netflix series you watched before bed. It is free labor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But—this is not what Hadamard is talking about when he describes the wordless thought of the mathematicians and researchers he has surveyed. Instead, what they seem to be doing is something similar to this subconscious, parallelized search, except they do it in a “tensely” focused way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The impression I get is that Hadamard loads a question into his mind (either in a non-verbal way, or by reading a mathematical problem that has been written by himself or someone else), and then he holds the problem effortfully centered in his mind. Effortfully, but wordlessly, and without clear visualizations. Describing the mental image that filled his mind while working on a problem concerning infinite series for his thesis, Hadamard writes that his mind was occupied by an image of a ribbon which was thicker in certain places (corresponding to possibly important terms). He also saw something that looked like equations, but as if seen from a distance, without glasses on: he was unable to make out what they said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what is going on here. But here’s a speculation. As I understand it, when one part of our brain is working, it often inhibits another—if you put words to distressing feelings, for example, the language-oriented parts of your brain inhibit the amygdala, which reduces the emotional distress. Similarly, when you are focused on a task at hand, the executive control network of your brain will tend to inhibit the default mode network which is responsible for mind wandering. (This might explain why illuminations tend to occur mainly in the shower, when the executive control networks downregulate and the mind is allowed to wander.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s my speculation: perhaps Hadamard and the other great mathematicians are able to enter into a modality of thought where they are able to keep both the default mode network and the executive control network on at the same time. Perhaps this allows them to do a sort of subconscious, in-the-shower-type processing, while still maintaining enough conscious focus to ensure the thoughts don’t drift away from the problem and its constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I look into this, I notice that there is research indicating that when doing certain types of creative work, the default mode network and the executive control network are, indeed, active at the same time, which they usually aren’t. Individuals who are experienced in a creative field seem to have the capacity to keep the default mode network turned on, allowing them to generate many permutations of ideas, while steering it with the executive control network, ensuring their parallelized mindwandering is constrained by the facts of the problem. I suspect we are all capable of this to some extent, but doing it to the extent Hadamard’s subjects did is akin to a ballerina spinning on her toes: a mental posture that requires serious practice to develop the necessary muscles and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not well-versed in neuroscience enough to know if I’m interpreting this right; I’m just speculating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what we do know is that Hadamard, as he worked, would pace up and down his room with what “witnesses to [his] daily life and work” called his “inside” look. (Others, like Poincaré and Helmholtz, seem to have sat at their desks, staring into nowhere.) And this type of deep, consciously-blurry concentration could go on for a long time: Hadamard mentions that he only stopped walking if he needed to write down a proof (reluctantly). An acquaintance writes that a friend of his shared an office with one of the best now living physicists; this physicist’s work habit was to come into the office in the morning and then stare into the wall for 8 hours before going home. Imagine holding a productive thought for that long without writing any steps down and, presumably, without even compressing things into words inside your head!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The interplay between writing and non-linguistic thinking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hadamard writes that he sometimes used algebraic signs when dealing with easy calculations, but adds that, “whenever the matter looks more difficult, they become too heavy a baggage for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are words too heavy?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reasoning from my experience, I suspect it is because words are laborious. When we put words to a thought, we have to compress something that is like a web in our mind, filled with connections and associations going in all directions, turning that web into a sequential string of words; we have to compress what is high-dimensional into something low-dimensional. This has all sorts of advantages, which I will return to, but the point I want to emphasize here is that compression is effortful. It takes intense concentration to find the right words (rather than the sloppy ones that first come to mind), and then to put them in the proper order. As James Joyce said to his friend when he was asked why he looked so gloomy, “I’ve only written seven words today…” “But why then are you in despair—seven words is a lot for you!” “I don’t know in which order to put them…”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we can avoid the compression step, and do the manipulations directly in the high-dimensional, non-linguistic, conceptual space, we can move much faster.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is a big if. Most people, myself included, have too weak mental models to do this kind of processing for complex problems, and so, our thoughts are riddled with contradictions and holes that we often don’t notice unless we try to write them down. We can move faster in wordless thought, but we’re moving at random. If, however, you have deep expertise in an area, like the mathematicians, it is possible to let go of the language compression and do a much faster search. M, who started his career as a physicist, tells me that when he was 13 and read that Einstein thought without words, he felt disappointed since his mind didn’t work like that; then, “a decade and many thousands of hours of mathematics and physics later,” he reread the passage and recognized himself almost completely. I guess this was because the labor of learning mathematics, done largely through reading and writing his way through complex ideas and problems, had given him deep enough mental models to make words somewhat superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even then, as Hadamard notes, writing is a necessary step of the process. The insights arrived at wordlessly need to be submitted to the rigor of mathematical notation and logic, to test their validity. It is a sort of feedback mechanism: unless the intuition holds up on the page, it is a false intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The written results also work as relay results. By writing something down and making sure it is solid, we can offload that thought from working memory and instead use it as a building block for the next step of the thought. Or, to use a metaphor by the mathematician William Hamilton, deep thinking is like building a tunnel through a sandbank:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In this operation, it is impossible to succeed unless every foot, nay, almost every inch in our progress be secured by an arch of masonry before we attempt the excavation of another. Now, language is to the mind precisely what the arch is to the tunnel. The power of thinking and the power of excavation are not dependent on the words in the one case, on the mason-work in the other; but without these subsidiaries, neither process could be carried on beyond its rudimentary commencement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So writing—and reading, seriously, the writings of others—is a way to collect stepping stones: ideas that have been stabilized enough that they can carry us as we walk deeper into the thought space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this stabilization of meaning can go wrong, too, if we stabilize ideas that aren’t ready to be stabilized yet. When writing, there are all sorts of details that need to be specified for our paragraphs to make sense, and if we don’t know what should go into a sentence, it is all too easy to fill in the uncertain parts with guesses. At least my brain has the most miraculous autocomplete function and supplies me with credible endings to any sentence I start—often credible nonsense. But when the nonsense is there on the page, next to thoughts I’ve settled through hard work, it looks respectable! It often takes considerable work to realize I’ve fooled myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was another reason Hadamard’s subjects gave for why they were reluctant to use words: they were afraid of the false precision writing forces onto thinking. They were afraid of premature precision and the confusion it breeds. By thinking in blurry images, or tensions of the hands, or sounds, they could keep their thoughts accurately vague in the areas where there was still uncertainty. They wrote down on paper, as settled, only mostly what was actually known. If you are disciplined, you can write in such a way that you avoid false precision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To sum up: the relationship between verbal thinking and deep wordless concentration is complex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Non-verbal, blurry thinking is faster and can search in a broader way, but it is more error-prone than verbal thought.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Good writing tends to come from an attempt to capture in words something you understand wordlessly, rather than moving ideas around on the page; but, paradoxically, a generative subconscious is usually one that has been trained by writing and deep reading, which provides the subconscious with relay results and other mental structures necessary for deep thought.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Writing forces precision, which can fool us into locking in details we have no reason to lock in, but written notes (or drawings) are a necessary aid when thinking long chains of thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last nine months, as I’ve been thinking about this topic, I’ve become more mindful about when words hinder and when they help. I notice that I spend more time in wordless thoughts than I used to. But I’m also more deliberate about using writing to structure my brain so it feeds me better thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, a big thank you to the paying subscribers who fund the work on the public essays. I couldn’t do this without you! I also want to thank Johanna Karlsson and Michael Nielsen for discussion about the topic. Esha Rana helped me with the final edit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can think of examples of mathematicians and physicist for whom this is not true. The first one who comes to mind is Richard Feynman, who said in an interview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Feynman:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually did the work on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Weiner:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That s right. It wasn’t a record of what you had done but it is the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Feynman:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the doing it — it’s the scrap paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Weiner:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, the work was done in your head but the record of it is still here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Feynman:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it’s not a record, not really, it’s working. You have to work on paper and this is the paper. OK?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more technical way of saying this is that our (non-verbal) thoughts seem to behave as vectors; when a cluster of neurons fire together, that pattern is like an address pointing toward a point in a high dimensional space. But when we convert our thoughts to words, we convert that vector into a scalar. I’m not sure if this is true, but here is a paper laying out the argument for why it might be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discussion of vectors and dimension reduction also has an interesting parallel to an ongoing discussion in AI research. When a large language model calculates what to output, the “thinking” happens in high dimensional space where vectors are passed from layer to layer. At the final layer, that high dimensional representation is collapsed into a token—the written output. When this happens, enormous amounts of information is lost: the residual stream contains over a thousand times more information than gets encoded into the token! That lends some support to the idea that non-verbal (partly unconscious) thinking might be more information rich in humans, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reasoning models, where the LLM is encouraged to think for longer, what happens is that this written output—this collapsed thought—is fed back into the model as input, so it can keep thinking about it. It is as if a person were to lose all of their memories and thoughts every few seconds and could only rely on whatever conclusions they had written on a slip of paper; this seems, potentially, like a limited way of thinking. To come around this problem—if it is a problem—one idea that is being explored is to feed the entire vector back into the model as a chain of thought, instead of the tokens on the scratch pad. This would be something like letting the models think in a non-verbal mental space, akin to what Hadamard described—thinking in the latent space, rather than on the scratch pad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Operations are "all or nothing."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anything you write to &lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; disappears entirely. There's no partial write problem: it’s either written (and discarded) or not written at all. ✅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Consistency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system transitions from one valid state to another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; always stays in a consistent state (empty). No matter what you write, the invariant "file contains nothing" always holds. ✅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Isolation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concurrent transactions don’t interfere with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple processes can write to &lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; at the same time, and their outputs never conflict, because nothing is ever stored. ✅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Durability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even after crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; "durably" commits your data into nothingness. After a crash or reboot, it still contains exactly what it always has: nothing. ✅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is only 1 small problem though, it only comes with 0b of free storage. For more space, you will have to contact entreprise sales, which is actually just me!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One of the slowest things you can do in an application is making system calls. They're slow because you do have to enter the kernel, which is quite expensive. What should you do when you need to do a lot of disk I/O but you care about performance? One solution is to use memory maps.&lt;lb/&gt;Memory maps are a modern Unix mechanism where you can take a file and make it part of the virtual memory. In Unix context, modern means that it was introduced in the 1980s or later. You have a file, containing data, you mmap it and you'll get a pointer to where this resides. Now, instead of seeking and reading, you just read from this pointer, adjusting the offset to get to the right data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To show what kind of performance you can get using memory maps, I've written a little Go library that allows you to read from a file using a memory map or a ReaderAt. ReaderAt will do a pread(), which is a seek/read combo, while mmap will just read from the memory map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This almost feels like magic. Initially, when we launched Varnish Cache back in 2006, this was one of the features that made Varnish Cache very fast when delivering content. Varnish Cache would use memory maps to deliver content at blistering speeds.&lt;lb/&gt;Also, since you can operate with pointers into memory that is allocated by the memory map, you'll reduce memory pressure as well as raw latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Downside of Memory Maps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The downside of memory maps is that you really can't write to the memory map. The reason is due to the way virtual memory works. When you're writing to a part of virtual memory that isn't mapped into physical memory, the CPU will generate a page fault. On a modern computer, the CPU is responsible for tracking what virtual memory pages are mapped onto what physical memory. Since you're writing to a page that isn't mapped, the CPU needs help.&lt;lb/&gt;So, when the page fault occurs, the OS will 1) allocate a new memory page, 2) read the contents of the file at the correct offset, 3) write this to the new memory page. Then control is returned to the application. The application will now overwrite the virtual memory page with new data.&lt;lb/&gt;Can we stop and appreciate how extremely inefficient this is? I think it is fairly safe to say that writing through a memory map is never a good idea when considering performance. At least if there is any risk, the file isn't mapped up in physical memory.&lt;lb/&gt;Let me illustrate this with a few more benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, whether or not the pages are in cache is crucial for performance. WriterAt, which uses the pwrite call, is a much more predictable bet.&lt;lb/&gt;Still, writing through memory maps, was what Varnish Cache did initially. It somehow got away with it, but mostly because the competition was pretty bad.&lt;lb/&gt;This is why Varnish Cache got the malloc backend and why Varnish Enterprise got the various Massive Storage Engines. The malloc backend resolved the problem by just allocating system memory through the malloc system call, and the Massive Storage Engine uses io_uring, which is so new that support for it is still somewhat limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Using Memory Maps to Solve Real-world Performance Problems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last couple of weeks I've been working on an HTTP-backed filesystem. This is part of our AI Storage Acceleration solution, geared towards high performance computing environments. In this filesystem we needed a way to transfer folder data over HTTP. A folder is really just a listing of files, symbolic links and directories. The naive approach would be just to use JSON encoding, but JSON is notorious for being slow.&lt;lb/&gt;Our priority is performance. We made a benchmarking suite, comparing various databases with each other. CDB was overall the fastest. Looking at the numbers, we'd still see that CDB would spend something like 1200ns on a database lookup that was entirely in the page cache. This seems very slow to me. After all, everything should be in memory and spending 1200ns reading memory sounds at least 100x too slow. I started looking into the CDB implementation I was using. It was the above ReaderAt implementation. So, most of the time is likely spent waiting for the operating system.&lt;lb/&gt;Some hours later, I was able to replace the seek/read with a memory map. This resulted in a 25x improvement in performance. Again, it feels like magic. Unlike the original file stevedore in Varnish Cache, this performance improvement has no downside.&lt;lb/&gt;Benchmarks: https://github.com/perbu/mmaps-in-go &lt;lb/&gt;CDB64 files with memory maps: https://github.com/perbu/cdb &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter-Strike has long been known for two things: tight tactical FPS gameplay and a thriving player marketplace effectively valued at literal billions of dollars. Now, thanks to a recent update from Valve, the latter is in a downward spiral, having lost 25% of its value — or $1.75 billion — overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, some context. Counter-Strike is a free-to-play multiplayer shooter. As with most other F2P games, it generates revenue from selling cosmetics. They arrive in lootbox-like Cases, which are opened by Keys purchased with real-world currency. They can also be obtained through trading with other players and purchasing from Steam Community Market. Beyond Steam, unofficial third-party marketplaces for CS cosmetics have also popped up as channels for buying and selling items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because items are obtained at random through opening Cases, rarer items fetch the highest value on the open marketplaces. Items of lower-rarity tiers can also be traded in at volume for an item of a higher tier via trade up contracts. Previously, Knives and Gloves could not be obtained through trade up contracts, exponentially increasing their value as highly sought-after items. Prior to the most recent update, some Knives, like a Doppler Ruby Butterfly Knife, could fetch around $20,000 on third-party storefronts like CSFloat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following Valve's Oct. 22 update to Counter-Strike, the second-highest-tier, Covert (Red), can now be traded up and turned into Knives and Gloves. Essentially, this means that a previously extremely rare and highly sought-after cosmetic is going to be much more obtainable for those who increasingly want it, reducing the value of Knives and Gloves on the open marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is where the market descends into a freefall. Now, that Butterfly Knife mentioned above? It's going for around $12,000, as people are essentially dumping their stock, with 15 sold over the past 16 hours at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg reported the market for Counter-Strike cosmetic items dropped 25% overnight from Wednesday evening into Thursday morning. It's lost about $1.84 billion in value, according to Pricempire, which tracks and analyses the market for CS items. "This completely changes the supply of Counter-Strike’s most sought-after and expensive tier of items," Pricempire marketing manager Ethan MacDonald told Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As sellers attempt to recoup their investments, similar fire sales like the one happening at CSFloat are occurring at other sites. One such site, Skin Port, even put us in a waiting room to access it; traffic was overwhelming its servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just like how NFT or cryptocurrency values can drastically shift, Counter-Strike item traders are seeing their stock rapidly change in value, and not for the best. While some items of lower-rarity tiers have gone up in value, and Reds might see a bump now that they can be traded up into Knives and Gloves, that can't make up for the sudden drop at the top of the cosmetics market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll have to wait and see if the market levels out or if it continues to crash. Plenty of players and CS traders must be eagerly awaiting more news: As of this writing, Pricempire's servers had crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Chengyue Wu [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Wed, 28 May 2025 17:39:15 UTC (272 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Wed, 2 Jul 2025 05:11:54 UTC (502 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v3] Thu, 3 Jul 2025 04:51:05 UTC (541 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launched in June 2024, JupyterGIS was introduced as a collaborative, web-based GIS environment built on the JupyterLab framework. Its objective is to bring QGIS-inspired workflows into the browser, enabling real-time collaborative editing, seamless integration with notebooks, and support for core geospatial data formats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it was first announced earlier this year, JupyterGIS already delivered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real-time collaborative editing (Google Docs-style)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visualisation of raster &amp;amp; vector data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symbology editing and spatio-temporal animations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Programmatic map control via a Python API.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to contributions from the community and support from partner organizations, JupyterGIS has advanced significantly and now offers an expanded range of features for analysis, visualization, and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced vector tile capabilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for vector tiles has been strengthened, including full compatibility with the pmtiles format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other key updates include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An identify tool that inspects vector tiles to display features and associated properties.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A symbology panel that applies graduated, categorized, and canonical symbology to vector tile layers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These improvements enhance the interpretability and styling of geospatial datasets directly in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new processing toolbox&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most significant updates is a new browser-based processing toolbox powered by a WebAssembly (WASM) build of the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Available tools include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Buffer: computes a buffer around geometries of a vector dataset.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Convex Hull: calculates the convex hull for each feature of an input layer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dissolve: combines features of vector layers into new features&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bounding Boxes: calculates the bounding box for each feature in an input layer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Centroid: creates a new layer with the centroids of the geometries of an input layer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Concave Hull: computes the concave hull for each feature of an input point layer.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This toolbox has been designed for extensibility, with a JSON schema that allows additional GDAL operations to be integrated in a straightforward manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Symbology enhancements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visualization of geospatial data has become more flexible and expressive through several enhancements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Viridis is now the default colormap, providing perceptually uniform visualization.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiband symbology is now available for GeoTIFFs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Canonical symbology defined in GeoJSON files can be applied automatically.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Colormaps can now be reversed, allowing greater flexibility for data interpretation and visualization.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the case of point layers, color and marker size can be styled independently, and bound to different data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration with SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) browser is now embedded into JupyterGIS, streamlining access to different data collections. Users can select specific platforms and sensors, choose data products and processing levels, and set temporal and spatial constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is now possible to search across multiple datasets simultaneously. Users can click on any result to add it directly as a layer to their JupyterGIS project. This creates a seamless workflow from data discovery to visualization, making it easier for researchers and analysts to find and integrate relevant satellite imagery and geospatial datasets into their Jupyter notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, the STAC Browser only supports the Geodes STAC API but support for all STAC catalogs is under way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for more data types&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The range of supported geospatial data formats is now broadened with GeoParquet and PMTiles, enabling efficient columnar storage and fast analytical queries for GeoParquet, and highly compact, streaming-friendly vector tile delivery for PMTiles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;User experience and interface improvements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interface has been refined for a smoother workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Integrated control panels (layer list, filters, layer properties, etc.), reducing back and forth between the JupyterLab side-panels and the JupyterGIS UI. It also improves the “single document” scenario, allowing it to interact with JupyterGIS controls when opening a GIS document from the classic Jupyter Notebook UI.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An improved toolbar design, with cleaner icons and better usability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A new feature to center the map on your current location.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Map annotations now link to the map: clicking an annotation automatically re-centers and zooms to the location.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full-screen mode support.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legends for vector layers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JupyterGIS now automatically generates legends for vector layers, ensuring consistent interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Legends are dynamically updated to reflect current symbology.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Customizations such as reversed colormaps are preserved.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JupyterGIS tiler extension&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An extension for JupyterGIS enables the creation of JupyterGIS layers from xarray variables in Jupyter kernels, with support for lazy evaluation, bridging geospatial workflows with powerful array-based computation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The package, called JupyterGIS-tiler, is available in GitHub here and can be installed from PyPI with pip install jupytergis-tiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Development will continue to expand JupyterGIS in several directions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extension of the GDAL-based processing toolbox.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deeper integration with QGIS and a richer Python API for automation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Story Maps Editor and Viewer to enable interactive communication of geospatial information through text, imagery, and maps.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, feel free to try JupyterGIS directly in your browser with JupyterLite, no installation required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opportunities for engagement also include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Checking out documentation for tutorials and the Python API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discussions via the GeoJupyter Zulip channel or the bi-weekly GeoJupyter hackathon.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Contributions to the development repository.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JupyterGIS community continues to grow, and active participation from researchers, developers, and educators worldwide is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Hosts on the ARPA Internet that choose to implement a Discard Protocol are expected to adopt and implement this standard. A useful debugging and measurement tool is a discard service. A discard service simply throws away any data it receives. TCP Based Discard Service One discard service is defined as a connection based application on TCP. A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port 9. Once a connection is established any data received is thrown away. No response is sent. This continues until the calling user terminates the connection. UDP Based Discard Service Another discard service is defined as a datagram based application on UDP. A server listens for UDP datagrams on UDP port 9. When a datagram is received, it is thrown away. No response is sent. Postel [Page 1] &lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Friday, Oct. 24 – 12:15 a.m. Pacific Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alaska Airlines operations have been restored after a significant IT outage resulted in a system-wide ground stop of flights for Alaska and Horizon. The ground stop was lifted at 11:30 p.m. Pacific. We are working to get our operations back on track as quickly and safely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since this afternoon, we’ve had more than 229 flight cancellations. Additional flight disruptions are likely as we reposition aircraft and crews throughout our network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We appreciate the patience of our guests whose travel plans have been disrupted. We’re working to get them to their destinations as quickly as we can. Before heading to the airport, we encourage flyers to check their flight status. A flexible travel policy is in place to support guests as operations return to normal following an IT outage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Thursday, Oct. 23 – 7 p.m. Pacific Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alaska Airlines is experiencing an IT outage that has resulted in a systemwide ground stop of Alaska and Horizon Air flights across our network, causing delays and cancellations. The IT outage does not affect Hawaiian Airlines flights. The issue began around 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 23, with a failure at our primary data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IT outage has impacted several of our key systems that enable us to run various operations, necessitating the implementation of the ground stop to keep our aircraft in position. The safety of our flights was never compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IT outage is not a cybersecurity event, and it’s not related to any other events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We deeply apologize to our guests whose travel plans have been disrupted today. We’re working to get them to their destinations as quickly as we can. For those who have a flight with us, please check your flight status before leaving for the airport. Also, a flexible travel policy is in place to support our guests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We normally think of interstellar flight in terms of reaching a single target. The usual destination is one of the Alpha Centauri stars, and because we know of a terrestrial-mass planet there, Proxima Centauri emerges as the best candidate. I don’t recall Proxima ever being named as the destination Breakthrough Starshot officially had in mind, but there is such a distance between it (4.2 light years) and the next target, Barnard’s Star at some 5.96 light years, that it seems evident we will give the nod to Proxima. If, that is, we decide to go interstellar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget, though, that if we build a beaming infrastructure either on Earth or in space that can accelerate a sail to a significant percentage of lightspeed, we can use it again and again. That means many possible targets. I like the idea of exploring other possibilities, which is why Cosimo Bambi’s ideas on black holes interest me. Associated with Fudan University in Shanghai as well as New Uzbekistan University in Tashkent, Bambi has been thinking about the proliferation of black holes in the galaxy, and the nearest one to us. I’ve been pondering his notions ever since reading about them last August.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Black holes are obviously hard to find as we scale down to solar mass objects, and right now the closest one to us is GAIA-BH1, some 1560 light years out. But reading Bambi’s most recent paper, I see that one estimate of the number of stellar mass black holes in our galaxy is 1.4 X 109. Bambi uses this number, but as we might expect, estimates vary widely, from 10 million to 1 billion. These numbers are extrapolated from the population of massive stars and to a very limited extent on clues from observational astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image: The first image of Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. Given how hard it was to achieve this image, can we find ways to locate far smaller solar-mass black holes, and possibly send a mission to one? Credit: Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bambi calculates a population of 1 black hole and 10 white dwarfs for every 100 stars in the general population. If he’s anywhere close to right, a black hole might well exist within 20 to 25 light years, conceivably detected in future observations by its effects upon the orbital motion of a companion star, assuming we are so lucky as to find a black hole in a binary system. The aforementioned GAIA-BH1 is in such a system, orbiting a companion star.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most black holes, though, are thought to be isolated. One black hole (OGLE-2011-BLG-0462) has been detected through microlensing, and perhaps LIGO A+, the upgrade to the two LIGO facilities in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana, can help us find more as we increase our skills at detecting gravitational waves. There are other options as well, as Bambi notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Murchikova &amp;amp; Sahu (2025) proposed to use observational facilities like the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), the Atacama Large Millimiter/Submillimiter Array (ALMA), and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Isolated black holes moving through the interstellar medium can accrete from the interstellar medium itself and such an accretion process produces electromagnetic radiation. Murchikova &amp;amp; Sahu (2025) showed that current observational facilities can already detect the radiation from isolated black holes in the warm medium of the Local Interstellar Cloud within 50 pc of Earth, but their identification as accreting black holes is challenging and requires multi-telescope observations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we do find a black hole out there at, say, 10 light years, we now have a target for future beamed sailcraft that offers an entirely different mission concept. We’re now probing not simply an unknown planet, but an astrophysical object so bizarre that observing its effects on spacetime will be a primary task. Sending two nanocraft, one could observe the other as it approaches the black hole. A signal sent from one to the other will be affected by the spacetime metric – the ‘geometry’ of spacetime – which would give us information about the Kerr solution to the phenomenon. The latter assumes a rotating black hole, whereas other solutions, like that of Schwarzschild, describe a non-rotating black hole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also intriguing is Bambi’s notion of testing fundamental constants. Does atomic physics change in gravitational fields this strong? There have been some papers exploring possible variations in fundamental constants over time, but little by way of observation studying gravitational fields much stronger than white dwarf surfaces. Two nanocraft in the vicinity of a black hole may offer a way to emit photons whose energies can probe the nature of the fine structure constant. The latter sets the interactions between elementary charged particles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For that matter, is a black hole inevitably possessed of an event horizon, or is it best described as an ‘horizonless compact object’ (Bambi’s term)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the presence of an event horizon, the signal from nanocraft B should be more and more redshifted (formally without disappearing, as an observer should never see a test-particle crossing the event horizon in a finite time, but, in practice, at some point the signal leaves the sensitivity band of the receiver on nanocraft A). If the compact object is a Kerr black hole, we can make clear predictions on the temporal evolution of the signal emitted by nanocraft B. If the compact object is a fuzzball [a bound state without event horizon], the temporal evolution of the signal should be different and presumably stop instantly when nanocraft B is converted into fuzzball degrees of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are so many things to learn about black holes that it is difficult to know where to begin, and I suspect that if many of our space probes have returned surprising results (think of the remarkable ‘heart’ on Pluto), a mission to a black hole would uncover mysteries and pose questions we have yet to ask. What an intriguing idea, and to my knowledge, no one else has made the point that if we ever reach the level of launching a mission to Proxima Centauri, we should be capable of engineering the same sort of flyby of a nearby black hole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And on the matter of small black holes, be aware of a just released paper examining the role of dark matter in their formation. This one considers black holes on a much smaller scale, possibly making the chances of finding a nearby one that much greater. Let me quote the abstract (the italics are mine). The citation is below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Exoplanets, with their large volumes and low temperatures, are ideal celestial detectors for probing dark matter (DM) interactions. DM particles can lose energy through scattering with the planetary interior and become gravitationally captured if their interaction with the visible sector is sufficiently strong. In the absence of annihilation, the captured DM thermalizes and accumulates at the planet’s center, eventually collapsing into black holes (BHs). Using gaseous exoplanets as an example, we demonstrate that BH formation can occur within an observable timescale for superheavy DM with masses greater than 106 GeV and nuclear scattering cross sections. The BHs may either accrete the planetary medium or evaporate via Hawking radiation, depending on the mass of the DM that formed them. We explore the possibility of periodic BH formation within the unconstrained DM parameter space and discuss potential detection methods, including observations of planetary-mass objects, pulsed high-energy cosmic rays, and variations in exoplanet temperatures. Our findings suggest that future extensive exoplanet observations could provide complementary opportunities to terrestrial and cosmological searches for superheavy DM.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Debian Technical Committee overrides systemd change&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Debian packagers have a great deal of latitude when it comes to the configuration of the software they package; they may opt, for example, to disable default features in software that they feel are a security hazard. However, packagers are expected to ensure that their packages comply with Debian Policy, regardless of the upstream's preferences. If a packager fails to comply with the policy, the Debian Technical Committee (TC) can step in to override them, which it has done in the case of a recent systemd change that broke several programs that depend on a world-writable /run/lock directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) specifies that the /var/lock directory should be used to store lock files for devices and other resources shared by multiple applications. On Debian, /var/lock is a symbolic link to /run/lock. The /run directory is created as a tmpfs filesystem specifically for run-time files by systemd-tmpfiles during system startup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debian Policy still cites the FHS, even though the FHS has gone unmaintained for more than a decade. The specification was not so much finished as abandoned after FHS 3.0 was released—though there is a slow-moving effort to revive and revise the standard as FHS 4.0, it has not yet produced any results. Meanwhile, in the absence of a current standard, systemd has spun off its file-hierarchy documentation to the Linux Userspace API (UAPI) Group as a specification. LWN covered that development in August, related to Fedora's search for an FHS successor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Locking up /run/lock&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The /run/lock directory was deprecated in Systemd v258; rather than dropping the directory entirely, though, the project has changed the default to making /run/lock writable only by root, which is stricter than the permissions Debian had shipped with previously &lt;del&gt;rather than making it world-writable as in the past&lt;/del&gt;. The plan is to get rid of /run/lock entirely in the v259 release, though users (or distributions) can still retain the legacy behavior by adding a configuration file in /etc/tmpfiles.d to override systemd's defaults and create the directory with the desired permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debian project just released a new stable version, Debian 13 ("trixie"), in August, and work has begun on Debian 14 ("forky"). The current stable version of Debian shipped with systemd v257, so users on stable will not be affected by these changes. But v258 has entered Debian unstable where the change to /run/lock broke other software, such as the Unix-to-Unix Copy program (UUCP) and the cu utility. Use of the directory is not limited to vintage utilities; Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek objected to removing /var/lock in v259 as it would break alsa-utils and create additional work for distributions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Doing this would this way just creat a foottrap for distributions: if they notice the change, they'll just create a local override, so we get a more complicated system in total with zero benefit to anyone. If they miss it, things will be broken for a while until users report it. And then they'll add the override.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On August 13, Marco d'Itri—who is listed as a maintainer of the systemd package—filed a bug against the uucp package reporting that systemd v258-rc1-1 had broken uucico, along with filing a bug against the systemd package, which cited the FHS entry for /var/lock. He said that a compromise might be to make the directory writable by the dialout group rather than world-writable. He also mentioned that there was a previous effort in 2014 to modernize software that uses UUCP-style locks to use flock() instead, but it stalled out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;"Dead and severely outdated"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than temporarily reverting the behavior, systemd maintainer Luca Boccassi argued that a world-writable directory in /run is a security risk. Any process could write as much as it wanted to /run, which could effectively DoS the system by exhausting space or inodes; filling up /run would then cause critical services, such as udev, to stop working. The FHS, he said, is "&lt;quote&gt;dead and severely outdated&lt;/quote&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue had already been discussed by the systemd project; Lennart Poettering had responded that he did not see the point of /var/lock "&lt;quote&gt;in the modern world&lt;/quote&gt;", but distributions were free to do as they see fit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Consider this more a passing of the baton from upstream systemd to downstreams: if your distro wants this kind of legacy interface, then just add this via a distro-specific tmpfiles drop-in. But there's no point really in forcing anyone who has a more forward-looking view of the world to still carry that dir.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Poettering argued that distributions could make their own choices, though it made him shudder to think of allowing unprivileged programs to fill up a directory. Boccassi echoed that sentiment in his response to the Debian systemd bug. Any package could ship a configuration for tmpfiles.d to create the directory and assume responsibility for it as well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I certainly won't try to stop anyone wishing to do it, but also I do not wish for these old workarounds to ship in this package either.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There's ~2 years time until Forky ships, and that should be plenty of time to either add this workaround elsewhere, or fix remaining programs to use BSD locks, or both, so I'm not going to hold back the new version from testing for this niche case, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boccassi closed the bug with the "WONTFIX" tag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Debian Policy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 1, d'Itri responded that upstream systemd's opinion was not relevant in this case. Debian policy requires the directory for lock files of serial devices, though he had also opened a bug to revisit that, since the practice of using /var/lock for serial-device locks dates back to the 1980s. However, /var/lock is provided by systemd, so he reasoned that it is a systemd bug unless another package was identified to take ownership of creating the directory. "&lt;quote&gt;But you cannot just decide that the policy violation does not exist.&lt;/quote&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thorsten Alteholz opened a bug with Debian's Technical Committee on September 15. He asked for advice on how to proceed since the systemd bug had been marked WONTFIX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;So what do you recommend how to go on from here? Change Debian policy (as asked in #1111839), revert the change in systemd, find a Debian wide solution or let every package maintainer implement their own solution?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bdale Garbee weighed in on the bug as well. He said that he uses cu "&lt;quote&gt;almost constantly for interacting with embedded serial consoles on devices a USB connection away from my laptop&lt;/quote&gt;". He was frustrated with the change imposed by systemd "&lt;quote&gt;with no warning&lt;/quote&gt;", and looked forward to the TC's response.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 24, Matthew Vernon responded to the bug, with a CC to the systemd maintainer alias. He said that it seemed that Debian Policy required FHS compliance, "&lt;quote&gt;at least until we come up with a transition plan&lt;/quote&gt;", and asked if systemd would please revert the change. There was no response from any of the systemd maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Override&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vernon updated the bug on September 29, and said that the TC had discussed the situation at its last meeting. The conclusion was that systemd should comply with policy, and thus FHS. He included a draft ballot text that the TC would vote on, which noted that the committee was "&lt;quote&gt;sympathetic&lt;/quote&gt;" to the argument that flock() would be a better solution, but that "&lt;quote&gt;an important part of the role of a Debian Developer is ensuring that software in Debian complies with Debian Policy&lt;/quote&gt;". A final ballot for the committee to consider was posted on October 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ballot contained three options; all three required that the systemd package provide /var/lock "&lt;quote&gt;with relaxed enough permissions that existing Debian software that uses /var/lock for system-wide locks of serial devices (and similar purposes) works again&lt;/quote&gt;". The committee would exercise its power under the Debian Constitution to override the systemd maintainers. The options were:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;1) This change to systemd must persist until a satisfactory migration of impacted software has occurred and Policy updated accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;2) This change to systemd must persist until Policy has been updated to allow otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;3) This change to systemd must persist until the TC allows otherwise, which the TC expects to do once a suitable transition plan has been agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vernon replied on October 6 to say that a decision had been reached and that option one had won.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Unlocking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debian's continued use of UUCP-style locking does seem to be more than a little bit dated. The FHS 3.0 is clearly reaching the end of its useful life, if not actually expired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a comparison, Fedora's uucp package has a patch to use lockdev instead. The upcoming Fedora 43 release includes systemd v258, and /run/lock is not world-writable. It seems like Debian could borrow Fedora's approach for the uucp package, though that would not solve the problem for any other Debian packages affected by the /run/lock change. There is also third-party software to consider, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To date, Boccassi has not responded to the conversation; I emailed d'Itri to ask why he did not make the change himself, since he was aware of the bug. He replied on October 13 and said that "&lt;quote&gt;a maintainer cannot force a decision on another maintainer&lt;/quote&gt;." Since he and Boccassi disagreed about the change it was left to the TC to decide. He said that he planned to prepare a merge request to implement the TC's decision, "&lt;quote&gt;as I have already agreed with Luca&lt;/quote&gt;", within the week.&lt;/p&gt;

The kernel doesn't break those too often, so for containers have worked nicely, as a little time capsule. But third-party binaries aren't really participating in this whole free software distribution project. You can't really plan around people who are doing their own thing and throwing opaque blobs over the wall every so often. Posted Oct 14, 2025 5:02 UTC (Tue) by notriddle (subscriber, #130608) [Link] You can, but you end up heavily limiting the amount of shared data that different subsystems/services/apps can see. Mere blocking isn't enough, because (1) this tends to result in systems that don't work when the permission is turned off, because that code path isn't tested (2) the existence of the file might be sensitive information in and of itself (3) what happens if two systems both think they should be able to use the same name for their things? This also means any change of behavior that's visible to the blob has to be opt-in. That's not how UNIX was designed. That's not even how Windows was designed, though MS has haphazardly added application-level namespacing features to patch around specific, widespread breakages. Hardened web browsers like Tor actually go in the right direction, but they only try to protect sites from each other: new APIs provided by the browser itself are dumped directly into the global namespace, and though they avoid adding anything that will cause widespread breakage, it's still possible for new browser-provided APIs to break a site by existing. Other than hardware virtualization systems like MAME, does anything actually do better on backwards compat than web browsers?

The terminal program now has exclusive use of the modem and proceeds to use it. Later a line condition causes Data Carrier Detect to drop. The way to reinitiate the modem link is to close() and re-open() the device file: this will drop and then re-assert the Data Terminal Ready line, which makes the modem re-attempt a connection. So with flock() there is a race condition which does not exist with a lock file: can the terminal program re-open() and re-flock() the device faster than the competition? The semantics of the lock file is "This program desires to use the serial device". That desire can remain even if the serial port is close()ed. The semantics of flock()ing the device cannot survive a close(). Posted Oct 16, 2025 12:31 UTC (Thu) by chris_se (subscriber, #99706) [Link] (2 responses) You can set the status of the DTR line via TIOCM_DTR on an open device, see also &amp;lt;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/TIOCMSET.2const.html&amp;gt;. There is no need to close the serial device. This is completely race-free. I don't think lockfiles are a good idea in any way, shape or form, because especially with modern containerization solutions, the only guarantee you have as a program is that if you can open() and flock() the device, you are allowed access to it. With containers you might not even see the same lock directory as the rest of the system (or another container), whereas you might have access to the same serial device. Hence I completely agree that getting rid of /var/lock and /run/lock is the right thing to do, it's just that in the current state of affairs this change should be coordinated with other software before the lock directory is phased out, so I do agree with Debian's TC's decision here. Side note: Actually, flock(, LOCK_EX) by itself is not sufficient to properly lock a serial port: every time a port is opened on Linux, at least some of the port's settings are reset to their defaults, even if it's already open. So the proper thing to do in my opinion is: 1) First flock(fd, LOCK_EX) it to avoid races You need both LOCK_EX and TIOCEXCL: TIOCEXCL prevents the open() command from other processes from working, so that other programs can't open the same device while your program is handling it, preventing some settings to be reset. flock() is still needed regardless, because otherwise you might have a race condition where process A calls open(), then process B calls open(), then process A calls ioctl(), and then process B calls ioctl(), and they both succeed (they would only prevent a process C from calling open() thereafter, the ioctls will both succeed), so use the flock() to avoid that specific race as well. (Caveat: TIOCEXCL doesn't help against root, but ideally you should run as little stuff as possible as root anyway.) Posted Oct 20, 2025 2:45 UTC (Mon) by gdt (subscriber, #6284) [Link] (1 responses) That changes the semantics of the end of a login session from a dial-in modem. The user terminates the shell, and that file close brings down DTR, clearing down the call. To adjust to this behaviour every shell will need to be updated. Whereas currently the system boot can create a lock file for every dial-in line to prevent its use by programs looking for a dial-out line. Posted Oct 20, 2025 16:11 UTC (Mon) by hmh (subscriber, #3838) [Link] It is worth considering that using /var/lock to ensure dial-in and dial-out separation, or any other "reservation" can, in the end, be decently implemented by naming the serial devices you want for dial-out differently from the ones for dial-in, etc (udev/mdev/etc are perfectly capable of being configured to do so). Giving it a good UX might not be that easy, though, and going distro-specific here is a major loss. The point about how classical tty-like devices behave ties in with the way other components (like the shells) work when plugged to a tty is very valuable. &lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; What is your plan for those?&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; I wasn't aware of that possibility, something to check next monday at work.&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; If you get updates from your third-party vendor, I suppose you'd talk to them to learn what the plan is.&lt;lb/&gt; More times than I'd like I've been held back from updating the distribution for the sake of enterprise-quality vendor tools.&lt;head&gt;Re: Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Progress with a Plan&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;What is the actual technical solution here?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;What is the actual technical solution here?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;New Package&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Single partition setups&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Single partition setups&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; At least on my Fedora, /var/lock is -&amp;gt; /run/lock, and /run is tmpfs.&lt;head&gt;Single partition setups&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Single partition setups&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Single partition setups&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Quota?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;quote&gt; shudder to think of allowing unprivileged programs to fill up a directory &lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head&gt;Why not a separate tmpfs?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Why not a separate tmpfs?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Why not a separate tmpfs?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Why was this a policy debate at all?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Why was this a policy debate at all?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;flock() versus lock file semantics&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;flock() versus lock file semantics&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; 2) second ioctl(fd, TIOCEXCL) to prevent further opens&lt;head&gt;flock() versus lock file semantics&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;flock() versus lock file semantics&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Computation and Language&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 28 Sep 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:ChunkLLM: A Lightweight Pluggable Framework for Accelerating LLMs Inference&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter (Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training. Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference. Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains 98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58% key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of 120K long texts.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
