  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple Photos App Corrupts Images&lt;/head&gt;Sep 17, 2025 @ 8:59 am&lt;p&gt;The Apple Photos app sometimes corrupts images when importing from my camera. I just wanted to make a blog post about it in case anyone else runs into the problem. I’ve seen other references to this online, but most of the people gave up trying to fix it, and none of them went as far as I did to debug the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to describe the problem, and the things I’ve tried to do to fix it. But also note that I’ve (sort of) given up on the Photos app too. Since I can’t trust it to import photos from my camera, I switched to a different workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of a corrupted image in the Photos app:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How I used to import images&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve got an OM System OM-1 camera. I used to shoot in RAW + jpg, then when I would import to Photos app, I would check the “delete photos after import” checkbox in order to empty the SD card. Turns out “delete after import” was a huge mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting corrupted images&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure I’d been getting corrupted images for a while, but it would only be 1 or 2 images out of thousands, so I thought nothing of it (it was probably my fault anyway, right?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the problem really got me upset when last year I went to a family member’s wedding and took tons of photos. Apple Photos combines RAW + jpg photos so you don’t have a bunch of duplicates, and when you view the images in the photos app, it just shows you the jpg version by default. After I imported all of the wedding photos I noticed some of them were corrupted. Upon closer inspection, I found that it sometimes had corrupted the jpg, sometimes corrupted the RAW file, and sometimes both. Since I had been checking the “delete after import” box, I didn’t know if the images on the SD card were corrupted before importing or not. After all, the files had been deleted so there was no way to check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I estimate I completely lost about 30% of the images I took that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing so many photos really rattled me, but I wanted to figure out the problem so I didn’t lose images in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Narrowing down the problem&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was worried this was somehow a hardware problem. Copying files seems so basic, I didn’t think there was any way a massively deployed app like Photos could fuck it up (especially since its main job is managing photo files). So, to narrow down the issue I changed out all of the hardware. Here are all the things I did:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Switched USB-C cables&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bought a new SD card direct from the manufacturer (to eliminate the possibility of buying a bootleg SD card)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Switched to only shooting in RAW (if importing messes up 30% of my images, but I cut the number of images I import by half, then that should be fewer corrupted images right? lol)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bought a new laptop&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bought a new camera: the OM System OM-1 MKii&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did each of these steps over time, as to only change one variable at a time, and still the image corruption persisted. I didn’t really want to buy a new camera, the MKii is not really a big improvement over the OM-1, but we had a family trip coming up and the idea that pressing the shutter button on the camera might not actually record the image didn’t sit well with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Finally a smoking gun&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I had replaced literally all of the hardware involved, I knew it must be a software problem. I stopped checking the “delete after import” button, and started reviewing all of the photos after import. After verifying none of them were corrupt, then I would format the SD card. I did this for months without finding any corrupt files. At this point I figured it was somehow a race condition or something when copying the photo files and deleting them at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after I got home from RailsConf and imported my photos, I found one corrupt image (the one above). I was able to verify that the image was not corrupt on the SD card, so the camera was working fine (meaning I probably didn’t need to buy a new camera body at all).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried deleting the corrupt file and re-importing the original to see if it was something about that particular image, but it re-imported just fine. In other words, it seems like the Photos app will corrupt files randomly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this is a problem that is specific to OM System cameras, and I’m not particularly interested in investing in a new camera system just to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I compare the corrupted image with the non-corrupted image, the file sizes are exactly the same, but the bytes are different:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checksums:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;aaron@tc ~/Downloads&amp;gt; md5sum P7110136-from-camera.ORF Exports/P7110136.ORF

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;P7110136-from-camera.ORF&lt;/code&gt; is the non-corrupted file, and &lt;code&gt;Exports/P7110136.ORF&lt;/code&gt; is the corrupted file from Photos app.
Here’s a screenshot of the preview of the non-corrupted photo:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the binary diff between the files. I ran both files through &lt;code&gt;xxd&lt;/code&gt; then diffed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My new workflow&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to put any more effort into debugging this problem, but I wanted to blog about it in case anyone else is seeing the issue. I take a lot of photos, and to be frank, most of them are not very good. I don’t want to look through a bunch of bad photos every time I look at my library, so culling photos is important. Culling photos in the Photos app is way too cumbersome, so I’ve switched to using Darktable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My current process is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Import images to Darktable&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Delete the ones I don’t like&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Process ones I do like&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Export both the jpg and the original raw file&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Import those to the Photos app so they’re easy to view and share&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Periodically format my SD card&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve not seen any file corruption when importing to Darktable, so I am convinced this is a problem with the Photos app. But now, since all of my images land in Darktable before making their way to the Photos app, I don’t really care anymore. The bad news is that I’ve spent a lot of time and money trying to debug this. I guess the good news is that now I have redundant hardware!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Procedural Island Generation (III)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post continues from Part II, where we established the paint map foundation and mountain ridge system. Now we’ll add detailed noise layers, distance-based mountain peaks, and do blending to create the final terrain elevation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Paint Map (recap)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before applying noise layers, we start with the foundation established in Part I - the paint map that defines our base land/water distribution:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For visualization throughout this series, we’ll be using the magma palette from matplotlib, which I patched to artificially darken the ocean areas to highlight the coastline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that we’ll be sampling the paint map per Delaunay triangle (at each triangle’s centroid):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that the paint map provides the broad strokes: positive values for land, negative for ocean, with smooth transitions between them. Now we’ll enhance it with noise layers to create realistic terrain detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multi-Scale Noise Layers&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will layer multiple octaves of Simplex noise at different frequencies over the broad strokes provided by the paint map. Each will contribute different detail scales to the final terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;mapgen4 by @redblobgames in particular uses six layers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Layer&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₀&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Lowest frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₁&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Low frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₂&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Medium-low frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₄&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;16x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Medium-high frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₅&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;32x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;High frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₆&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;64x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Highest frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice the gap in numbering (n₃ is missing). This would correspond to frequency 8x, which we don’t use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Coastal Noise Enhancement&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;mapgen4 starts with coastal noise enhancement. This provides control over the variation at coastlines while keeping inland elevation unaffected:&lt;/p&gt;\[e = \text{Paint map from Part I}\] \[e_{coast} = e + \alpha \cdot (1 - e^4) \cdot \left(n_4 + \frac{n_5}{2} + \frac{n_6}{4}\right)\]&lt;p&gt;The term \((1 - e^4)\) creates a bell curve that peaks at \(e=0\) (coastline) and decreases rapidly for \(\lvert e \rvert &amp;gt; 0\). This modulates an fBm-like combination of our three highest frequency noise layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What matters here isn’t the exact formula or amplitudes, but the core principle: applying high-frequency detail specifically where land meets water.&lt;/p&gt;\[e_{tmp} = \begin{cases} e &amp;amp; \text{if } e_{coast} &amp;gt; 0 \\ e_{coast} &amp;amp; \text{if } e_{coast} \leq 0 \end{cases}\]&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mountain Distance Field&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mountains need special pre-processing. If you remember from Part I in the swarm of seed points we tagged some as mountain peaks. Here we will pre-compute a distance field from every regular seed point to the closest mountain peak point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compute distance through the mesh topology of the Delaunay triangulation using BFS (breadth-first search). i.e., we don’t use Euclidean distance. This creates more organic mountain shapes that follow the terrain’s natural connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm spreads outward from mountain peaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Start at triangles containing mountain seed points (distance = 0)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Visit neighboring triangles, incrementing distance by a randomized amount&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The randomization creates natural ridge patterns instead of perfect cones&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the magic formula used for distance increment in each step:&lt;/p&gt;\[\Delta = s \cdot (1 + j \cdot r)\]&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(s\) = spacing between triangles (uses configured Poisson disk separation)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(j\) = jaggedness parameter (0 = true topological distance, 1 = very irregular)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(r \in [-1,1]\) = random factor using triangular distribution&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The triangular distribution &lt;code&gt;rand() - rand()&lt;/code&gt; clusters values near zero while allowing occasional larger variations. This looks more natural than uniform randomness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I implemented Fisher-Yates shuffling when visiting neighbor triangles. Instead of processing neighbors in a fixed order (which would create directional bias), the order is randomly shuffled each time. This ensures mountain ridges branch out organically in all directions rather than following predictable patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After computing distances this way, we normalize them (by the max dist, for example):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Elevation Blending&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final elevation combines all components through weighted blending:&lt;/p&gt;\[e_{final} = \begin{cases} \text{lerp}(e_{coast}^2, e_{hill}, e_{mountain}) &amp;amp; \text{if } e_{coast} &amp;gt; 0 \\ e_{coast} \cdot (\rho + n_1) &amp;amp; \text{if } e_{coast} \leq 0 \end{cases}\]&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(e_{hill} = h \cdot (1 + \text{lerp}(\frac{1 + n_0}{2}, n_4, n_2))\) =&amp;gt; hill elevation with noise-modulated height&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(e_{mountain} = 1 - \frac{\mu}{2^\sigma} \cdot d_m\) =&amp;gt; mountain elevation from distance field&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quadratic blend weight produces smooth transitions from hills near the coast through mixed terrain at mid-elevations to pure mountains at peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With (editable) parameters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(\alpha\): Coastal noise strength (0.01)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(h\): Hill height scale (0.02)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(\rho\): Ocean depth multiplier (1.5)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(\mu\): Mountain slope (17.6)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(\sigma\): Mountain sharpness (9.8)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interactive Parameter Exploration&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Region (vs. Triangle) Elevation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve computed elevation for triangles. But our Voronoi regions (from Part I) also need elevations for certain stages in the rest of the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each seed point defines a Voronoi region and serves as a vertex in multiple Delaunay triangles. To assign elevation to a Voronoi region, we average the elevations of all triangles that share its seed point as a vertex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;With elevation complete, our island has shape but lacks the defining features carved by water. Part IV will simulate the hydrological cycle: rainfall patterns influenced by topography, rivers flowing from peaks to ocean, and valleys carved by erosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Valuable Resources&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Terrain from Noise - Amit Patel’s Red Blob Games guide to layering noise for terrain&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Polygonal Map Generation - Red Blob Games on Voronoi-based terrain (mapgen4 inspiration)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Distance Fields for Terrain - Red Blob Games on using distance fields in terrain generation&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now on the front page of Hacker News — join the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a recent post, we introduced the Tau² benchmark, a framework for benchmaring LLMs. Today we’re sharing a surprising discovery we made while using it: a simple prompt rewrite boosted a small model’s success rate by over 20%. This post is a deep-dive on how we found and fixed this performance bottleneck by making subtle changes to agent policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarking LLMs with Tau²&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the recent OpenAI Summer Update, we have seen that GPT-5 model has made significant strides in agentic tasks. To validate these claims, they’ve turned to the Tau² benchmark, which simulates real-world agent interactions across various domains like telecom, retail, and airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before moving any further, we have to establish that GPT-5 showed significant improvement only in one benchmark domain - which is Telecom. The other ones have been somehow overlooked during model presentation - therefore we won’t bother about them either (😉).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In agentic interactions, accuracy is non-negotiable, but model speed is equally vital for user experience. Therefore, it makes sense to consider alternatives to flagship models, such as the recently introduced GPT-5-mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT-5-mini offers significant advantages: it’s roughly twice as fast in latency and noticeably more efficient in throughput. While delivering 85–95% of the full GPT-5’s performance, it is also five times cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, we ran an experiment to explore two things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How well GPT-5-mini performs on this benchmark.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whether we can improve its results by making subtle changes to the domain, such as modifying agent policies or task descriptions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Baseline: Expect GPT-5-mini to Fail 45% of the Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, we’re going to establish the benchmark for the GPT-5-mini model. As the telecom benchmark contains over 100 tests, we’ll use their subset. Luckily, the telecom_small task set comes in handy with just 20 test scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running the benchmark with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tau2 run \
    --domain telecom \
    --agent-llm gpt-5-mini \
    --user-llm gpt-5-mini \
    --num-trials 2 --task-set-name telecom_small&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ended up running 40 simulations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial success rate was low: just 55%. The GPT-5-mini with its limited reasoning capabilities doesn’t even get close to flagship GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s an additional interesting metric this benchmark has introduced, which is pass^k. This measures how well an agent can perform when it’s challenged with the same task k times. I like to think of it as the reliability of the AI Agent.&lt;lb/&gt; Another intriguing aspect of this benchmark are tasks which failed for all given trials - which could imply that the AI Agent is simply not capable of handling at all. This can happen due to multiple factors - reasoning might be too difficult, user ask could not be specific enough, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Hack: Using Claude to Rewrite Prompts for GPT-5-mini&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When hacking the AI Agent for &lt;code&gt;GPT-5-mini&lt;/code&gt; model we aimed to answer three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can I improve the overall success rate when using this limited model?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Are we able to “unlock” more tasks which agents are capable of handling?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Does agent reliability improve?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The beauty of generative AI is that we could offload lots of work and allow ourselves a little laziness. Therefore, we asked Claude to analyze the AI agent policies in the telecom domain, which are the building blocks for the agent prompt. From there, we asked specifically to assume that these policies are going to feed an AI Agent prompt, which will be using faster, non-flagship LLM. Output documents (&lt;code&gt;main_policy.md&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tech_support_manual.md&lt;/code&gt;) will have to be rephrased so that they are easier to follow for the agent and result in improving its behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the “executive summary” of improvements it made:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;I've created two AI-optimized versions of the telecom domain documentation:

Key Improvements Made:

1. Structure &amp;amp; Flow
   - Decision Trees: Clear branching logic with ├── and └── notation
   - Sequential Steps: Numbered, ordered procedures instead of scattered explanations
   - Prerequisites: Explicit dependency checks before proceeding

2. AI Agent Optimizations
   - Tool Call Clarity: Exact function names and parameters
   - Binary Decisions: Clear yes/no conditions instead of ambiguous language
   - Error Handling: Specific failure conditions and next steps
   - Verification Steps: "Recheck" instructions after each fix

3. Cognitive Load Reduction
   - Reference Tables: Quick lookup for tools and purposes
   - Pattern Recognition: Common issue combinations and their solutions
   - Critical Reminders: Common AI mistakes section to prevent errors

4. Actionable Language
   - Removed verbose explanations mixed with instructions
   - Consolidated multiple documents' logic into single workflows
   - Used imperative commands: "Check X", "If Y then Z"
   - Added immediate verification steps&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve moved from lengthy policy declarations to clear, directive instructions. Instead of wordy statements, the new style uses step-by-step logic, conditions, and patterns. For prompts, this works more like a checklist — “Check X → If Y, then Z” — rather than vague, descriptive policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Result: 22% Accuracy Boost and 50% Fewer Unsolvable Tasks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s review what our improved AI agent results look like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new prompts led to a significant performance boost. Pass^k metrics surged:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;k=1 from 0.55 to 0.675 (a 22.73% improvement) → In plain terms, GPT-5-mini now succeeds on 67.5% of tasks instead of 55%.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;k=2 from 0.4 to 0.5 (a 25% improvement) → Meaning retries became more effective too.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For context, flagship GPT-5 scores ~97% on this benchmark, o3 comes in at 58%, and GPT-4.1 at 34%. With our optimized prompts, GPT-5-mini not only jumped well above its own baseline but also outperformed o3, landing much closer to GPT-5 than before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The side-by-side comparison shows exactly where the gains came from. On the left side of the screen you’ll see the “stock” AI agent results, on the right - our AI agent improved for GPT-5-mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The screenshot above outlines that with our updated prompts and policies, we managed to “unlock” some of the tests which were previously always failing due to GPT-5-mini’s limited capabilities. Now there are only 3 tasks, which the agent didn’t manage to solve at all within the given 2 trials - compared to 6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key Takeaways for Your Own Models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This experiment shows that thoughtful prompt design can meaningfully boost the performance of smaller models like GPT-5-mini. By restructuring policies into clear, step-by-step instructions, we not only improved success rates but also “unlocked” tasks that previously seemed unsolvable for the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key was in simplifying language, reducing ambiguity, and breaking down reasoning into explicit, actionable steps. Smaller models struggle with long-winded or fuzzy policies, but thrive when given structured flows, binary decisions, and lightweight verification steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The takeaway is clear: using a frontier model to automatically optimize prompts can unlock major improvements for smaller LLMs. With strategic optimization, lightweight models can deliver decent results at a fraction of the cost — making them a compelling alternative when efficiency and affordability matter as much as accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you found this helpful, let us know! Prompt engineering is still an open playground, and we’re excited to see what creative approaches others are exploring in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discuss it on LinkedIn, X or Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Since publishing this post and hitting the front page of HN, some readers expressed interest in seeing the actual before and after policies (which are building block for the agent prompt). Initially I thought these would be too lengthy for the article and no one would care, but since there’s interest, I’m happy to share them in this Pull Request.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uuidv47 lets you store sortable UUIDv7 in your database while emitting a UUIDv4-looking façade at your API boundary. It does this by XOR-masking only the UUIDv7 timestamp field with a keyed SipHash-2-4 stream tied to the UUID’s own random bits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Header-only C (C89) · zero deps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deterministic, invertible mapping (exact round-trip)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RFC-compatible version/variant bits (v7 in DB, v4 on the wire)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Key-recovery resistant (SipHash-2-4, 128-bit key)&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;DB-friendly: UUIDv7 is time-ordered → better index locality &amp;amp; pagination.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Externally neutral: The façade hides timing patterns and looks like v4 to clients/systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Secret safety: Uses a PRF (SipHash-2-4). Non-crypto hashes are not suitable when the key must not leak.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

    &lt;p&gt;UUIDv7 bit layout:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;ver: high nibble of byte 6 = 0x7 (v7) or 0x4 (façade)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;rand_a: 12 random bits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;var: RFC variant (0b10)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;rand_b: 62 random bits&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Façade mapping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encode: ts48 ^ mask48(R), set version=4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decode: encTS ^ mask48(R), set version=7&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Random bits unchanged&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SipHash input: 10 bytes from random field: msg[0] = (byte6 &amp;amp; 0x0F) msg[1] = byte7 msg[2] = (byte8 &amp;amp; 0x3F) msg[3..9] = bytes9..15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invertibility: XOR mask is reversible with known key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collision analysis: Injective mapping. Only risk is duplicate randoms per ms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Goal: Secret key unrecoverable even with chosen inputs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Achieved: SipHash-2-4 is a keyed PRF.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keys: 128-bit. Derive via HKDF.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotation: store small key ID outside UUID.&lt;/item&gt;

sudo make install
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do encode/decode at API boundary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For Postgres, write tiny C extension.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For sharding, hash v4 façade with xxh3 or SipHash.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SipHash-2-4 on 10-byte message is extremely fast. No allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Why not xxHash with a secret? A: Not a PRF; secret can leak. Use SipHash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Is façade indistinguishable from v4? A: Yes, variable bits uniform, version/variant set to v4.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past month or so, many YouTubers have been reporting major drops to their video view counts. Theories have run wild, but there’s one explanation involving ad blockers that makes the most sense, but YouTube isn’t confirming anything directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since mid-August, many YouTubers have noticed their view counts are considerably lower than they were before, in some cases with very drastic drops. The reason for the drop, though, has been shrouded in mystery for many creators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most likely explanation seems to be that YouTube is not counting views properly for users with an ad blocker enabled, another step in the platform’s continued war on ad blockers. This was first realized by Josh Strife Hayes, who noticed that view counts on TV, phones, and tablets have been steady, while views on computers have dropped by around 50% since the mid-August trend started. TechLinked, a channel in the Linus Tech Tips family, confirmed similar numbers within its statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This aligns with one of the possible explanations that YouTube itself hinted at in an acknowledgement of lower view counts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Viewers Using Ad Blockers &amp;amp; Other Content Blocking Tools: Ad blockers and other extensions can impact the accuracy of reported view counts. Channels whose audiences include a higher proportion of users utilizing such tools may see more fluctuations in traffic related to updates to these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by Napalmxxx2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We wouldn't need ad blockers if we weren't force fed irrelevant to us ads, unskippable ads, and the worst offender; ads that are LONGER than the video being watched.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We wouldn't feel the necessity if we weren't intruded on by a monopoly out for its own self interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of the post addresses prior speculation that YouTube’s new AI-powered age verification tools were to blame – which YouTube adamantly says is not the case – while also offering other possible explanations such as “seasonal viewing habits” and competition on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YouTube says “there is no systemic issue that is impacting creators” regarding lower view counts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ad blocker situation does seem the most likely explanation, though. In a prior video, Linus Tech Tips had noted that while view counts were down, ad revenue was not. If computer views are the only ones down, it stands to reason that viewers using an ad blocker are not being counted correctly, especially if ad revenue isn’t taking a hit from the lower view counts. YouTube’s hint that ad blockers “can impact the accuracy of reported view counts” certainly suggests this is possible, even if it’s not firm confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How to Motivate Yourself To Do A Thing You Don't Want to Do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn some ways to help encourage action when you feel unmotivated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have an air bike in our basement. If you are unfamiliar with air bikes, they are similar to stationary bikes with foot pedals but also have handles you push and pull with your arms. It uses air resistance, so the harder you pedal and move your arms, the higher the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also known as an assault bike. 😬&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is apt, because it’s a butt-kicker of a workout. I use it about once a week, more frequently in the winter when it’s too cold to run, and less often in the summer when I can get outside more. And I kind of hate it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I even drag myself to our basement, I’m already dreading it. The only way I can convince myself to do it is by finding a suitably engaging show I can distract myself with on my phone while I huff and puff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time, I start my warm-up and think to myself,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s only 30 minutes, I can do this!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like clockwork, within the first three minutes, I think, “Maybe I will only do ten minutes today and do some pilates or weights instead.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After ten minutes, I think, “OK, surely I can make it to 20 minutes, and that will be enough”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 20 minutes, as I gasp for air and sweat soaks through my shirt, I think “Well, I already made it to 20 minutes… I guess I will just finish it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then I proceed to huff and puff to the end, wherein I walk my wobbly legs back up the stairs to do a cooldown. At which point I think, “That suuuuuucked…” And then congratulate myself on finishing as I try to get my heart rate back to normal. 🥵&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This mental dance happens, without fail, every single time I ride.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I share this anecdote because it illustrates how tricky motivation can be, especially when faced with something you don’t want to do or have been procrastinating on. There are any number of things you have to deal with in your life that you don’t want to. There are even things you might generally enjoy that feel like they are hanging over you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern often goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Before you start, it feels daunting, and the prospect lingers in the back of your mind. You know it needs to be done, but you really, really don’t feel like it. You leave it until it starts to loom larger and larger.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When you finally convince yourself to start, it’s not what you want to be doing, but it’s generally fine. It’s often not even as bad as you thought it would be, and it feels good to make progress.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As you near the end, you can even push yourself a little to wrap it up and get it off your plate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When it’s over, you feel relieved, like a weight has been taken off your shoulders, and you are both pleased with yourself and a little annoyed that it took you so long to deal with.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motivation is a topic that comes up with nearly all my clients, as they navigate the various complexities of their lives. In some ways, motivation seems simple. You ask yourself, “Why can’t I just make myself be motivated to do the thing?”, whatever the thing might be. However, as you beat yourself up about it, consider that many factors influence our decision-making and the feeling of being motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans are complex creatures, with numerous brain chemicals and hormones influencing our overall physical and emotional state, which themselves are constantly impacted, sometimes drastically, by things like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have you been sleeping well and enough?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have you been eating well and the right amount for you?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have you been imbibing in alcohol or other things?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have you been moving your body regularly?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do you have any physical or mental conditions?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Are you in pain?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do you have significant life stressors at this time?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What time of day is it?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where are you in your natural hormone cycles?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How old are you?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have you had any conflicts in your life recently?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Did you move your body in a way entirely within your usual routines, but apparently in a way that is no longer acceptable?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Did you sleep in a slightly different position than usual, and now your back will never be the same again?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could go on, but you get the idea.😅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these factors (and more) conspire to shift your mood, physical energy, and mental energy, often making it harder to muster the motivation to do things. What, then, can you do to move things in the right direction? How do you motivate yourself to do a thing you don’t want to do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are several ways to help encourage action when you feel unmotivated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Think about why you are feeling unmotivated&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many external and internal factors, as listed above, that contribute to motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When your body isn’t feeling good, it’s harder to make it do things.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When your mind is tired, distracted, or overwhelmed, it’s challenging to focus and accomplish tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When the thing you need to do isn’t important to you or something you don’t like, it’s hard to make yourself do it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you know why you aren’t motivated, you can think about what you could change to make things easier on yourself. What factors do you have control over?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Environment - Is there a place you can go or a thing you can add that will make it feel easier? For example, I have my writing desk set up in a quiet corner of my bedroom (not the office I share with my husband) to help make writing easier, even when I am not feeling it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mood - Is there something that will help boost your mood? Go for a ten-minute walk, treat yourself to a donut, text your best friend for a pep talk, turn on your favourite tunes… anything that will give you a little pick-me-up.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Body - Are there things you can do to take care of your body to make it feel better? Try some stretching, take a nap, meditate, read a book, get some fresh air, go for a run, eat a comfort meal, or do anything that will help your body feel less stressed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Negative or fear motivators - Is the thing you are not motivated to do being motivated by negative or fear motivators? These include things like fear of judgment, fear of conflict, shame, guilt, or obligation. These motivators only go so far and deserve further examination to determine their place in your priorities. Maybe they aren’t things you need to do in the first place.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key point here is to identify where you have control and where you don’t, and then do your best to adapt your circumstances to make it easier to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Identify what does motivate you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you think about the various activities and tasks you do each day, what is it that encourages you to do them? Some of those things will be negative motivators, as I mentioned above, but others will be things you do for fun, because they are interesting or rewarding. These are some tactics to consider for things that might help motivate you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Combine the task with something you enjoy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know what makes cleaning out the garage a lot better? Some good tunes. Throw on an audiobook while you cook dinner. Watch a good show while you huff and puff on the air bike! Think about the things you enjoy and consider how you can combine them with the thing you're trying to motivate yourself to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Add external accountability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it can be challenging to push yourself to do something when there are no external motivators. Ask a friend to be your accountability buddy, or hire a professional to help you stay accountable for the thing you're trying to do, such as a coach, trainer, teacher, or dietitian. I know that one of the significant value-added benefits my clients get from working with me for a few months is having someone they have to report back to on their progress!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gamify&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there any way to turn the process or thing you are unmotivated to do into a game? Can you add rewards if you do a certain amount, or set a goal for how many days you make progress in a row? For example, one of my motivators for doing some kind of fitness every day is keeping up my streak! 2817 days in a row as of publishing. 😁&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Celebrate milestones&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond small planned rewards, having something to look forward to as you make progress on your task or activity can also help encourage you to continue moving forward. Maybe you take a day off, order your favourite takeout, or simply share it with someone you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more specifics on types of motivation, read my article, What Motivates You? Learn the Types of Motivation and How to Use Them, where I get into more detail about intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Break it into smaller chunks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If part of why you feel unmotivated is that what you need to do feels big and overwhelming, often the best thing you can do is try to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. What is the smallest amount you can do to make a bit of progress?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commit to spending 5 minutes on it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Choose a small corner of a room you need to clean&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commit to writing the outline&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write the text, even if you don’t send it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plan in your calendar when you will do it, so you don’t have it sitting in the back of your mind&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Talk about it with your partner or a friend&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Switch tasks to take a break and come back to it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often, getting over the hump of starting something is enough to help push you through it. Even if it isn’t, at the very least, you have made some amount of progress, which you can build on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Consistency over motivation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the thing you need to do is something you need to do regularly, like writing, fitness, practicing an instrument, or cleaning, you can’t rely purely on motivation to drive you. Even for things you enjoy, it’s easy to push something off “until you feel like it”. But with so many factors affecting your mood and energy, the times when you feel like it will be fleeting. Instead of relying on motivation, try to establish a routine that fosters consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plan your intentional week so you have an idea of when you intend to do it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set a daily reminder&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Book it in your calendar&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set a certain amount of time you will put aside each day or week to chip away at it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little bit, consistently, will go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Put it on the back burner&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when you are not feeling motivated to do something, it’s reasonable to just put it on the back burner. Maybe it’s just not a priority right now, and that’s totally fine! Ask yourself, is this a glass ball or a plastic ball? If it’s plastic, set it aside for a bit and focus your time and energy on other things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's ok to decide now is not the right time, but make it an intentional decision instead of something you avoid and feel bad about!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're struggling with motivation, you're not alone! It’s normal, it’s natural, and there are tons of different, ever-changing factors that will change how you feel. Do your best to examine where you are at, control what you can control, and make progress where you can!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mssql-python is a Python driver for Microsoft SQL Server and the Azure SQL family of databases. It leverages Direct Database Connectivity (DDBC) that enables direct connections to SQL Server without requiring an external driver manager. Designed to comply with the DB API 2.0 specification, this driver also introduces Pythonic enhancements for improved usability and functionality. It supports a full range of database operations, including connection management, query execution, and transaction handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The driver is compatible with all the Python versions &amp;gt;= 3.10&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Windows, MacOS and Linux (manylinux - Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, SUSE (x64 only) &amp;amp; musllinux - Alpine)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: SUSE Linux ARM64 is not supported by Microsoft ODBC Driver. Use x64 architecture for SUSE deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft mssql-python module is designed to be fully compliant with the DB API 2.0 specification. This ensures that the driver adheres to a standardized interface for database access in Python, providing consistency and reliability across different database systems. Key aspects of DBAPI v2.0 compliance include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connection Objects: Establishing and managing connections to the database.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cursor Objects: Executing SQL commands and retrieving results.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transaction Management: Supporting commit and rollback operations to ensure data integrity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Error Handling: Providing a consistent set of exceptions for handling database errors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parameter Substitution: Allowing the use of placeholders in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By adhering to the DB API 2.0 specification, the mssql-python module ensures compatibility with a wide range of Python applications and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for developers working with Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Managed Instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft mssql-python driver enables Python applications to connect to Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or Azure SQL Managed Instance using Microsoft Entra ID identities. It supports a variety of authentication methods, including username and password, Microsoft Entra managed identity (system-assigned and user-assigned), Integrated Windows Authentication in a federated, domain-joined environment, interactive authentication via browser, device code flow for environments without browser access, and the default authentication method based on environment and configuration. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most suitable authentication approach for their deployment scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EntraID authentication is now fully supported on MacOS and Linux but with certain limitations as mentioned in the table:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Authentication Method&lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The driver offers a suite of Pythonic enhancements that streamline database interactions, making it easier for developers to execute queries, manage connections, and handle data more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft mssql_python driver provides built-in support for connection pooling, which helps improve performance and scalability by reusing active database connections instead of creating a new connection for every request. This feature is enabled by default. For more information, refer Connection Pooling Wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connect to SQL Server and execute a simple query:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import mssql_python
 
# Establish a connection
# Specify connection string
connection_string = "SERVER=&amp;lt;your_server_name&amp;gt;;DATABASE=&amp;lt;your_database_name&amp;gt;;UID=&amp;lt;your_user_name&amp;gt;;PWD=&amp;lt;your_password&amp;gt;;Encrypt=yes;"
connection = mssql_python.connect(connection_string)
 
# Execute a query
cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * from customer")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
 
for row in rows:
    print(row)
 
# Close the connection
connection.close()

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Severe Drought in Iraq Reveals Dozens of Ancient Tombs Created 2,300 Years Ago&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The tombs, which likely date to Iraq’s Hellenistic period, were discovered along the Mosul Dam reservoir&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have discovered 40 tombs in Iraq after severe droughts lowered water levels in the country’s largest reservoir, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tombs were discovered along the Mosul Dam reservoir in northern Iraq’s Duhok Province. They are thought to be more than 2,300 years old, likely from the Hellenistic period, when Iraq was under the rule of the Seleucid Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Quick fact: The reach of the Seleucid Empire&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At its peak, the empire stretched from what is now Turkey to the edges of India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A team of archaeologists had surveyed the same area in 2023, also when water levels were low. However, they only spotted parts of the tombs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, conditions were different. Iraq is in the midst of one of its driest years on record in nearly a century, according to Al Jazeera. Severe water shortages are threatening the country’s health and safety as water reserves have dwindled to just 8 percent of their full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir dropped “to their lowest,” archaeologists were able to return and access the tombs, Bekas Brefkany, leader of the site’s archaeological work, tells AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“While the receding waters have had negative impacts, for us as archaeologists, they have also provided an opportunity to rediscover areas that had long been hidden underwater,” Brefkany explains to the Art Newspaper’s Hadani Ditmars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brefkany and his team are racing to excavate the tombs before the dam is flooded again. What they dig up will be transferred to the Duhok Museum for study and preservation. As Brefkany tells the Art Newspaper, he hopes that researchers will eventually be able to “shed more light on causes of death, family ties and the broader social context of these burials.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iraq has contended with numerous droughts in recent years. They have brought regions of the country to the brink of humanitarian disaster, which experts warn will worsen if the government doesn’t intervene, per Al Jazeera. According to the United Nations, Iraq is one of the countries “most vulnerable to the impact of climate change” due to rising temperatures, frequent sand and dust storms, and water scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the droughts have also led to archaeological discoveries across the country. In 2022, ruins of a 3,400-year-old city were found in a dried-up section of the Mosul Dam reservoir along the Tigris River. As water levels continue to drop, the archaeologists expect to unearth more artifacts, Nazim Zibari, an archaeologist at the site, tells France 24.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This work that we are doing now is very difficult, complex and it takes time,” Zibari says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, archaeologists found a rare stone relief among the ruins of ancient Assyrian metropolis Nineveh in Mosul, a city in northern Iraq. The artifact depicts important deities alongside Ashurbanipal, the last great king of the Assyrian Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;@ctrl/tinycolor Supply Chain Attack Post-mortem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Scott Cooper&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A malicious GitHub Actions workflow was pushed to a shared repo and exfiltrated a npm token with broad publish rights. The attacker then used that token to publish malicious versions of 20 packages, including &lt;code&gt;@ctrl/tinycolor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My GitHub account, the @ctrl/tinycolor repository were not directly compromised. There was no phishing involved, and no malicious packages were installed on my machine and I already use pnpm to avoid unapproved postinstall scripts. There was no pull request involved because a repo admin does not need a pull request to add new github actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub/npm security responded quickly, unpublishing the malicious versions. I followed by releasing clean versions to flush caches, as advised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For broader context, see Socket’s write-up or StepSecurity’s analysis. For community discussion, see this Hacker News post, which spent 24 hours on the front page. I’m also finding this wiz.io post helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How I Found Out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 15 around 4:30 PM PT, Wes Todd DM’d me on Bluesky and looped me into the OpenJS Foundation Slack. By that point, Wes had already alerted GitHub/npm security, who were compiling lists of affected packages and rapidly unpublishing compromised versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early guidance (attributed to Daniel Pereira) was to look for suspicious &lt;code&gt;Shai-Hulud&lt;/code&gt; repos or branches. I wasn’t able to find any of these repos or branches on my own personal repos. The mystery was: how was I impacted at all?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Shai-Hulud was the Fremen term for the sandworm of Arrakis. - dune wiki&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Actually Happened&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A while ago, I collaborated on angulartics2, a shared repository where multiple people still had admin rights. That repo still contained a GitHub Actions secret — a npm token with broad publish rights. This collaborator had access to projects with other people which I believe explains some of the other 40 initial packages that were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new Shai-Hulud branch was force pushed to angulartics2 with a malicious github action workflow by a collaborator. The workflow ran immediately on push (did not need review since the collaborator is an admin) and stole the npm token. With the stolen token, the attacker published malicious versions of 20 packages. Many of which are not widely used, however the @ctrl/tinycolor package is downloaded about 2 million times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub and npm security teams moved quickly to unpublish the malicious versions. I then re-published fresh, verified versions of the packages I maintain to flush caches and restore trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malicious versions of several packages — including @ctrl/tinycolor — were briefly available on npm before removal. Installing those compromised versions would have triggered a postinstall payload, which is documented in detail by StepSecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should you do if you’ve installed a compromised version of a package? see StepSecurity’s immediate actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Publishing Setup &amp;amp; Interim Plan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I currently use semantic-release with GitHub Actions to handle publishing. The automation is convenient and predictable. I also have npm provenance enabled on many packages, which provides attestations of how they were built. Unfortunately, provenance didn’t prevent this attack because the attacker had a valid token.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goal is to move to npm’s Trusted Publishing (OIDC) to eliminate static tokens altogether. However, semantic-release integration is still in progress: npm/cli#8525.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the forseeable future, @ctrl/tinycolor requires 2FA for publishing, and all tokens have been revoked. Not expecting to merge any new changes anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For smaller packages, I’ll continue using semantic-release but under stricter controls: no new contributors will be added, and each repo will use a granular npm token limited to publish-only rights for that specific package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local 2FA based publishing isn’t sustainable, so I’m watching OIDC/Trusted Publishing closely and will adopt it as soon as it fits the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plan to continue using pnpm that prevents unapproved postinstall scripts from being run and I’ll look into adding pnpm’s new minimumReleaseAge setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Publishing Wishlist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I could wave a magic wand and design my ideal setup, npm would allow me to require Trusted Publishing (OIDC) with a single toggle for all of my packages. That same toggle would block any release missing provenance, enforcing security at the account level. I’d also want first-class semantic-release support with OIDC and provenance so no static tokens are ever needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that, I’d like a secure, human-approved publishing option directly in the GitHub UI: a protected workflow_dispatch flow that uses github 2FA approval to satisfy 2FA, without requiring me to publish from my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub Environments — or equivalent workflow protections — should be available without a Pro subscription, or else integrated directly into Trusted Publishing so that security doesn’t depend on the pricing tier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be really nice if NPM also had a more visible mark on the package details page to indicate if the package had a postinstall script. Also, once the packages are pulled its not clear what versions were removed and why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thanks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Wes Todd, the OpenJS Foundation, and the GitHub/npm security teams for their rapid and coordinated response. Everyone was incredibly fast, helpful, and knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depression and anxiety are often characterized by altered reward-seeking and avoidance, respectively. Yet less is known about the relationship between depressive symptoms and specific avoidance behaviors. To address this gap, we conducted two studies. In Study 1, undergraduates and online workers completed an uninstructed go/no-go avoidance task (NTotal = 465) as a reverse translation of a rodent paradigm. Participants exhibited a wide range of symptom scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), ranging from low to severe. In Study 1, cues were used to signal the response type (go/active vs no-go/inhibitory) required to avoid an aversive sound. Higher depressive scores were associated with poorer acquisition of active avoidance in undergraduates. Overall participants showed lower accuracy for active than inhibitory avoidance. To examine whether the better no-go trial performance reflected a prepotent response to avoid aversive outcomes, in Study 2, undergraduates (NTotal = 330) completed a version of the task that included reward-seeking. Here all participants showed higher accuracy for active reward-seeking and inhibitory avoidance, consistent with a prepotent response to inhibit action to avoid aversive consequences. These findings suggest that in young adults, depressive symptoms are associated with difficulty in overriding prepotent responses to actively avoid aversive outcomes in the absence of reward. This work bridges the gap between preclinical animal models and clinical research, offering insights that could guide the development of more targeted clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Translational studies in community samples are crucial for bridging the gap between rodent models, which delineate neural circuitry and pharmacology underlying specific behaviors, and the presentation of mood disorders in clinic settings. Building on rodent studies of avoidance behaviors, thought to be linked to depression, this study examines how depressive symptom scores relate to specific types of avoidance. Our findings revealed that higher depressive symptom scores were associated with reduced capacity to learn active avoidance behaviors, which involved overriding a prepotent response to inhibit action to avoid aversive consequences. This work bridges the gap between preclinical animal models and clinical research, offering insights that may guide the development of more targeted clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stimuli that predict aversive events typically evoke avoidance responses aimed at minimizing anticipated threats. Depending on the situation, an active strategy, such as taking an action (walking away), may be most effective, while in other situations, the inhibition of motor output (staying put to avoid detection) may be the more prudent strategy. Although effective in many contexts, these strategies can become maladaptive in depression and anxiety, interfering with goal-directed behavior (Ottenbreit et al., 2014; Haskell et al., 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depression is a leading cause of global disability (Whiteford et al., 2013; World Health Organization, 2017), yet its cognitive and behavioral mechanisms remains to be fully understood. The Altered Computations underlying Decision Making (ACDM) framework posits that decision-making biases perpetuate both depression and anxiety (Bishop and Gagne, 2018). Depression is marked by reduced engagement in reward-seeking, while anxiety by heightened avoidance. In depression, impairments arise from underestimating the probability and value of positive outcomes, and overestimating the effort required to obtain them (Bishop and Gagne, 2018), ultimately leading to reduced engagement in actions. Supporting this view, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) choose high-effort, high-reward options less frequently, anticipate fewer positive experiences, and rate them as less pleasurable (MacLeod and Salaminiou, 2001; Treadway et al., 2012; Mukherjee et al., 2020; Horne et al., 2021). Although the ACDM primarily distinguishes between depression-related biases in reward-seeking, it also suggests that effort-related impairments may extend to avoidance contexts and contribute to reduced active avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this, the role of active versus inhibitory forms of avoidance remains underexplored in depression, reflecting broader trends in which negatively valenced systems are predominantly studied in anxiety (Craske et al., 2009). Cognitive theories of depression emphasize a negativity bias in attention, memory, and future expectations (Mogg et al., 2006; Fales et al., 2008; Disner et al., 2011) but often rely on self-report and lack emphasis on behaviors with translational utility for identifying cross-species neurobiological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning tasks offer a translational approach for examining negatively valenced systems and have been applied across neuropsychiatric conditions (Endrass et al., 2011; Palminteri et al., 2012; Reinen et al., 2016; Waltz et al., 2018), including depression (Chase et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2012; Mkrtchian et al., 2017; Mukherjee et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2023). These studies typically involve probabilistic and reversal learning tasks to probe sensitivity to reward and punishment. Findings remain mixed: some report reward-specific impairments in depression (Robinson et al., 2012), others find broader impairments across valence (Chase et al., 2010; Mkrtchian et al., 2017; Mukherjee et al., 2020) or even heightened punishment sensitivity (Murphy et al., 2003; Nord et al., 2018), while others identify learning-specific impairments (Chase et al., 2010; Mukherjee et al., 2020). These inconsistencies highlight the need for behavioral assays that isolate avoidance processes and align with cross-species models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Translational gaps can stem from task design. Human studies typically use secondary reinforcers (i.e., monetary rewards or feedback), with punishment operationalized as monetary loss, and avoidance inferred from decreased selection of high-loss options, often omitting safety signals. In contrast, animal paradigms use primary reinforcers (i.e., shock) and deterministic contingencies and explicitly distinguish between active and inhibitory avoidance (Piantadosi et al., 2018; Capuzzo and Floresco, 2020). Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies show overlapping blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses to primary and secondary aversive cues, regions like the amygdala are more responsive to primary aversive cues (Delgado et al., 2011). Importantly, shared BOLD activation does not necessarily imply equivalent neural mechanisms—especially when task features might differ meaningfully. Translating animal behavioral paradigms to humans has been proposed as a promising strategy to enhance cross-species translation and improve psychiatric treatment development (Kirlic et al., 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address these gaps, we adapted a validated rodent task designed to assess both active and inhibitory avoidance (Piantadosi et al., 2018; Capuzzo and Floresco, 2020) and deployed it in a large online sample. While prior human studies have included related features, our avoidance task was modeled to parallel the original rodent paradigm. Our aim was to examine how depressive symptom severity relates to the ability to learn and flexibly implement active and inhibitory avoidance strategies. Using a dimensional approach aligned with Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) principles, we recruited a nonclinical sample reporting a broad range of depressive symptoms. We hypothesized that higher depressive symptom scores would be associated with impairments in active—but not inhibitory—avoidance, consistent with ACDM predictions of reduced behavioral engagement stemming from effort overestimation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Study 1 (avoidance)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Participants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We conducted a power analysis using G*Power to detect a small effect size &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Materials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Stimuli&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The task was created in PsychoPy 2020.1 (RRID: SCR_006571) and distributed via Pavlovia (www.pavlovia.org; Peirce et al., 2019). Simple shapes signaled the type of response (active vs inhibitory) required to avoid an aversive sound. Coauthor I.D.D. recorded a set of screeching and scraping sounds (i.e., knife on glass, fork on plate, metal on slate), from which 45 were pilot-tested for unpleasantness and salience (N = 45). Using 9-point Likert scales, eight sounds with the highest combined ratings (unpleasantness: M = 6.87–7.57; salience: M = 5.82–6.83) and lowest variance were selected. These eight aversive sounds were randomly presented on failed trials and were found to be highly motivating. In Study 1, 92.46% of participants who responded to a debriefing question (N = 464) endorsed the aversive sounds as motivating to avoid. Rapid acquisition of instrumental avoidance responses further supports the functional aversiveness of the stimuli. On successful trials, a white border around the gray background signaled safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Measures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depressive and anxiety symptom scores were derived from the clinically validated Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1988b; Beck et al., 1996) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck et al., 1988a), respectively. One question (suicidality ideation) was removed from the BDI-II for ethical considerations. BDI-II symptom scores were calculated as a proportion score (BDI-IIscore/BDI-IImax_possible_score) for each participant. Similarly, BAI scores are reported as proportion scores (BAIscore/BAImax_possible_score) for consistency and comparability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Procedure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants were tested on a computer-based avoidance task that was reverse-translated from a rodent operant paradigm assessing active/inhibitory avoidance—with some modifications (Piantadosi et al., 2018; Capuzzo and Floresco, 2020). Prior to the avoidance task, participants completed an effort calibration and a volume calibration to control for differences in physical ability and computer systems (see https://osf.io/5sepm/).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Active/inhibitory avoidance task&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specific shapes (circle or squares; counterbalanced) signaled active (“Go”) versus inhibitory (“No-Go”) responses required to avoid a highly aversive sound. The avoidance task consisted of three task stages: acquisition, intermixed, and reversal (Fig. 1A). (1) The acquisition stage required learning an active avoidance response. During the acquisition stage, participants had to reach a criterion performance of 80% successful trials within the previous 20 trials (maximum 120 trials). Once acquisition criterion was reached, participants performed an additional 30 “over-learning” active avoidance trials before an unsignaled transition into the next task stage. Participants failing to reach criterion performance during the acquisition stage were excluded from data analysis. (2) The intermixed stage required participants to learn the inhibitory avoidance response while flexibly deploying both active and inhibitory responses. This stage consisted of 120 avoidance trials (60 active, 60 inhibitory), presented in a pseudorandomized order. (3) The reversal stage also consisted of 120 avoidance trials (60 active, 60 inhibitory; pseudorandomized), but with active and inhibitory response contingencies reversed. The multiple task stages allowed us to assess distinct patterns in the acquisition and expression of active/inhibitory avoidance, as well as reversal learning. Importantly, participants were not instructed about the cue–response contingencies to allow the acquisition through reinforcement, to mirror the rodent paradigm the task was translated from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trials began with a fixation cross onscreen (ISI; 2,000 ms; jittered 1,200 ms). Active avoidance required an effortful response—specifically, 3, 4, or 5 rapid button presses (criterion determined during effort calibration test). On successful active trials (Fig. 1B), participants made the required response within the cue period (≤1,200 ms), resulting in the avoidance of the aversive sound and the presentation of a safety signal (1,000 ms). On failed active trials (Fig. 1C), either an insufficient response or no response within the cue period triggered the aversive sound (1,000 ms). On inhibitory trials, participants were required to withhold responding. On successful inhibitory trials (Fig. 1D), participants made no button presses during the cue period (1,200 ms), resulting in the avoidance of the aversive sound and the presentation of a safety signal (1,000 ms). On failed inhibitory trials (Fig. 1E), an erroneous button press triggered the aversive sound. A graphical overview of the avoidance task is provided in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All analyses were conducted in R 4.2.1 (R Core Team, 2013) using RStudio (Booth et al., 2018). Primary outcome measures included proportion correct for active and inhibitory trials across task stages and the number of trials to criterion during acquisition. Within-subjects ANOVAs were used except where otherwise stated. Significant main effects or interactions were followed by pairwise comparisons using the emmeans package (Searle et al., 1980; Lenth, 2017), with Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) correction. Between-subject ANOVAs tested sex and sample effects on BDI-II scores. To examine individual differences, we used regression and linear mixed models (lmerTest; fit by REML, t tests using Satterthwaite's method; Bates et al., 2015; Kuznetsova et al., 2017) to assess BDI-II scores effects on task performance. To account for multiple comparisons, the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We present only the BDI-II analyses in the main text, while corresponding analyses for BAI scores are presented in Extended Data (Extended Data Figs. 2-1, 4-1; Extended Data Tables 3-1, 3-3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Study 2 (reward-seeking/avoidance)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Participants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Undergraduate participants (N = 771) from the University of British Columbia Psychology Human Subjects Pool were recruited to perform a reward-seeking/avoidance task. Power analysis procedures were identical to Study 1. Recruitment focused exclusively on undergraduates, as effects in Study 1 were strongest in this population. Compensation was identical to the undergraduate sample in Study 1. To motivate performance during reward-seeking trials, participants were told their accumulated points would contribute to the value of a gift card, although participants ultimately received a $5 gift card regardless of performance. Exclusion criteria were similar to Study 1, with the added requirement that participants reach criterion accuracy during acquisition for both reward-seeking and avoidance trials independently. Because the task was designed as a reinforcement-based learning paradigm—with minimal instructions, no explicit information about contingencies, and no practice trials—and given variability in motivation among undergraduates completing online studies for credit, exclusions rates were higher than expected, resulting in lower-than-ideal power. For details on participant exclusion rates, see Discussion and Extended Data (Extended Data Table 1-1). After cleaning, the final sample included N = 330 participants (Nfemale = 245; Nmale = 85). The study was approved by the University of British Columbia Behavioral Research Ethics Board (BREB) under certificate H20-01388. Demographic information for Study 2 can be found in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Table 1-1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download Table 1-1, TEX file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Materials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Stimuli and measures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The task was implemented using PsychoPy and Pavlovia (same as Study 1) with modification to incorporate reward-seeking trials. Stimuli included four simple shapes (blue; square, circle, triangle, hexagon) counterbalanced across response type (active vs inhibitory) and motivational context (reward-seeking vs avoidance). As in Study 1, participants completed questionnaire measures, effort, and volume calibrations procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Mixed-motivation go/no-go task&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mixed-motivation task consisted of two stages: (1) an acquisition stage, where participants learned active reward-seeking and active avoidance responses, and (2) an intermixed stage, which required the flexible expression of active and inhibitory responses across reward-seeking and avoidance contexts. During the acquisition stage, participants had to reach 80% accuracy within the previous 20 trials, independently for both active reward-seeking and active avoidance trials. After reaching the acquisition criterion, participants completed 24 “over-learning” trials (12 reward-seeking and 12 avoidance) before an unsignaled transition into the intermixed stage. Participants who failed to reach criterion were excluded from analysis. The intermixed stage consisted of 240 trials (60 of each type—active reward-seeking, inhibitory reward-seeking, active avoidance, inhibitory avoidance), presented in a pseudorandomized order. The reversal stage used in Study 1 was omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trials began with a fixation cross (ISI; 2,000 ms; jittered 1,200 ms). Active responses required 3, 4, or 5 button presses within the 1,200 ms cue period (threshold determined during effort calibration). On successful trials, participants either earned 5 points or avoided an aversive sound, depending on the motivational context. Successful reward-seeking trials provided a reward signal (1,000 ms; white border), while successful avoidance trials were followed by a safety signal (1,000 ms; white border). On failed trials, participants either received no points (reward-seeking) or were presented with an aversive sound (avoidance). Points accumulated were displayed on reward-seeking trials, and a musical tone (C major chord; 1,100 ms) played each time participants earned an additional 25 points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analytical procedures followed Study 1. Accuracy (proportion correct) and trials to criterion during acquisition were the primary outcomes. Linear mixed models tested BDI-II symptom scores effects on active and inhibitory accuracy across motivational contexts. FDR corrections were used for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Code accessibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No computational neuroscience models were developed for this study. However, extended data and code used to conduct the linear mixed models are available at https://osf.io/5sepm/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Study 1 (avoidance)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Demographics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To assess differences between undergraduates and online workers, we first compared self-reported depressive and anxiety symptom scores. There was no difference in depressive symptom scores (F(1,463) = 0.34, p = 0.56; Fig. 2A), but undergraduates reported significantly higher anxiety symptom scores compared with online workers (F(1,463) = 13.84, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 2-1). Sex and gender responses were highly congruent (&amp;gt;96%); due to limited statistical power for non-cis gender categories, subsequent analyses refer to sex only. Females reported higher depressive (F(1,463) = 7.96, p &amp;lt; 0.01; Fig. 2B) and higher anxiety (F(1,463) = 33.63, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 2-1) symptom scores than males. Finally, there was a significant age difference between samples (F(1,462) = 299.8, p &amp;lt; 0.001), with undergraduates being younger on average compared with online workers (Extended Data Fig. 2-2).&lt;/p&gt;

A) Anxiety score distributions by sample: Undergraduates (red) and Online Workers (blue). B) Anxiety score distributions by sex: Female (red) and Male (blue). The x-axis represents proportion scores, where raw BAI scores, ranging from 0-63, have been divided by the maximum possible score (63) to produce a proportion between 0 and 1. This adjustment was made for comparability between the BDI-II and BAI scales. The labels on the x-axis -- Minimal (0-7), Mild-Moderate (8-25), Severe (26-63) -- reflect typical ranges of raw scores for ease of interpretation. Dashed vertical lines represent the mean BAI score for each group. In panel A, a significant difference in anxiety levels between sample groups is indicated (p &amp;lt; .001), with undergraduates scoring higher on average than online workers. In panel B, a significant difference in anxiety levels between sexes is indicated (p &amp;lt; .001), with females scoring higher on average than males. Download Figure 2-1, TIF file.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Within-subject results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acquisition. The acquisition task stage assessed initial learning of the active avoidance response. Participants showed robust acquisition, with an average accuracy of 0.79 (SD = 0.15; Fig. 3A). The mean number of trials to reach criterion (≥80% correct in 20 trial period) was 29.65 (SD = 18.42; range, 16–120 trials; Fig. 4A). Higher BDI-II scores were associated with a greater number of trials needed to reach criterion during acquisition, but this effect was specific to undergraduates (Fig. 4B; see https://osf.io/5sepm/).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Figure 4-1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Study 1: Trials to Criterion for Active Avoidance During the Acquisition Stage. A) Number of trials required to reach criterion for all participants in the avoidance task. Individual data points (green circles) represent the number of trials each participant required to reach the criterion of 80% correct responses within 20-trial period during acquisition. B) Interaction between anxiety scores (BAI proportion scores) and the sample group (Undergraduates vs. Online Workers) predicting trials to criterion for active avoidance. The regression lines show the relationship between anxiety scores and trials to criterion for each sample, with a stronger effect observed in undergraduates (β = 16.14) compared to online workers (β = -3.81). A significant main effect of BAI scores (p &amp;lt; .01) and a significant BAI × Sample interaction (p &amp;lt; .05) are indicated. Download Figure 4-1, TIF file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intermixed and reversal. The intermixed task stage assessed participants’ ability to switch between active and inhibitory responses using discriminative cues, while the reversal task stage assessed behavioral flexibility when cue–response contingencies were reversed. A 2 × 2 within-subjects ANOVA assessing proportion correct, with Avoidance Type (active, inhibitory) and Task Stage (intermixed, reversal) as within-subjects factors, revealed a significant effect of Avoidance Type and Task Stage, and a significant interaction (Table 2). Follow-up analysis revealed higher accuracy on inhibitory compared with active trials in both the intermixed (MInhibitory = 0.90, SD = 0.06; MActive = 0.87, SD = 0.12; t(711) = −4.74, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Fig. 3B) and reversal stages (MInhibitory = 0.90, SD = 0.07; MActive = 0.82, SD = 0.15; t(711) = −12.18, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Fig. 3C). Accuracy on active trials was also higher in the intermixed compared with the reversal stage (t(877) = 10.49, p &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas inhibitory accuracy did not differ by stage (t(877) = 0.81, p = 0.42).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Between-subject results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depressive symptom scores and active avoidance accuracy. To examine the relationship between depressive symptom scores and active avoidance accuracy, we used a linear mixed model with BDI-II symptom scores (z-normalized, grand-mean centered) as the primary predictor. The model included Sex (female, male), Task Stage (acquisition, intermixed, reversal), and Sample (undergraduates, online workers) as fixed effects and Participant as a random intercept. Proportion correct on active trials was also z-normalized (grand-mean centered). To ensure model stability, we adopted a simplified random-effects structure that excluded a random slope for Task Stage. As shown in Table 3, the model revealed a significant main effect of BDI-II (β = −0.230, SE = 0.074, p = 0.009), indicating that higher depressive symptoms were associated with lower active avoidance accuracy when all other variables were at their reference levels (i.e., female, acquisition, undergraduates). After controlling for multiple comparisons, there were no significant interactions between BDI-II and Sex or Sample. However, we observed a significant interaction between BDI-II and Task Stage, with the relationship between depressive symptoms and active avoidance accuracy changing in the intermixed (β = 0.300, SE = 0.083, p = 0.003) and reversal stages (β = 0.215, SE = 0.083, p = 0.041), relative to acquisition. These interactions suggest that the negative relationship between depressive symptoms and active avoidance accuracy was strongest during initial learning (acquisition) and was attenuated at later stages when avoidance responses are well-learned or inhibitory control was required (Fig. 5).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Depressive symptom scores and inhibitory avoidance accuracy. A similar linear mixed model was used to examine the relationship between depressive symptom scores (BDI-II symptom scores, z-normalized, grand-mean centered) and inhibitory avoidance accuracy (z-normalized, grand-mean centered). The model included Sex (female, male), Task Stage (intermixed, reversal), and Sample (undergraduates, online workers) as fixed effects and Participant as a random intercept. No main effects or interactions involving BDI-II were significant (Extended Data Table 3-2), suggesting that depressive symptoms were not associated with inhibitory avoidance performance using this task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Study 2 (reward-seeking/avoidance)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Study 1, participants showed lower accuracy on active compared with inhibitory avoidance trials. However, it remained unclear whether this effect was driven by conflict arising from a prepotent tendency to inhibit action under threat (Bolles, 1970; Pessoa, 2009; Wendt et al., 2017) or by a preference to reduce effort expenditure due to the additional demands of effortful active responses (Hogan et al., 2020; Forys et al., 2023). To address this, Study 2 used a mixed-motivation task that assesses both active and inhibitory responses within reward-seeking and avoidance contexts in undergraduates. Here, the design manipulated the congruency between motivational context (reward-seeking vs avoidance) and instrumental response (active vs inhibitory), allowing for analysis of how motivational context shapes action tendencies. Moreover, because the ACDM framework proposes that depression is associated with altered reward-seeking and effort-related decision-making (Bishop and Gagne, 2018), we examined whether individual differences in depressive symptom scores would differentially affect behavior across motivational contexts. This design allowed for a detailed examination of both reward-seeking and avoidance behaviors, considering their active and inhibitory dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that task accuracy would be highest for inhibitory avoidance and active reward-seeking, as these behaviors are contextually aligned with prepotent response tendencies—inhibiting action to avoid threat and initiating action to obtain reward. Furthermore, we expected that participants with higher depressive symptom scores would exhibit reduced accuracy in active reward-seeking, consistent with predictions of diminished behavioral engagement due to effort demand overestimation and/or reward undervaluation. A graphical overview of the mixed-motivation task is provided in Figure 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Females reported marginally higher levels of depressive symptoms (F(1,328) = 3.24, p = 0.0729) and significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms (F(1,328) = 12.99, p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with males (Fig. 7B; Extended Data Fig. 7-1). There was no significant age difference between sex (F(1,328) = 0.112, p = 0.738).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Acquisition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants successfully learned both active reward-seeking and avoidance responses, as indicated by the number of trials to criterion (reward-seeking: M = 46.94, SD = 18.09; avoidance: M = 51.72, SD = 19.90). A one-way within-subjects ANOVA revealed a significant effect of Motivational Context on the number of trials to criterion, with more trials needed to acquire active avoidance than reward-seeking (F(1,329) = 30.96, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Fig. 8A). To test whether depressive symptoms predicted trials to criterion, we fit a linear mixed model including BDI-II scores, Sex, and Motivational Context. No main or interaction effect of BDI-II was observed. Motivational context significantly affected acquisition accuracy, with lower proportion correct on active avoidance (M = 0.774, SD = 0.135) compared with active reward-seeking (M = 0.819, SD = 0.137; F(1,329) = 52.59, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Fig. 8B). To assess how this difference varied over time, we analyzed accuracy across the first six trial blocks (where all participants had data). Accuracy improved across blocks (main effect of block) and remained higher for reward-seeking trials compared with avoidance trials (main effect of Motivational Context; Table 4). While this difference persisted across blocks 1–5 (t's(1629) &amp;gt; 2.56, p's &amp;lt; 0.01), it converged by block 6 (t(1,629) = 1.59, p = 0.11; Fig. 8C), suggesting slower acquisition for active avoidance than reward-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Intermixed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intermixed stage assessed participants’ ability to flexibly select actions or inhibit responses based on motivational contexts (i.e., reward-seeking vs avoidance). A 2 × 2 within-subjects ANOVA (Motivational Context × Response Type) revealed a significant main effect of Response Type and a significant interaction but no main effect of Motivational Context (Table 5). Follow-up analysis revealed higher accuracy for active reward-seeking than active avoidance (t(658) = 9.92, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and higher accuracy for inhibitory avoidance compared with inhibitory reward-seeking (t(658) = 9.60, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). In the avoidance context, inhibitory responses were more accurate compared with active responses (t(658) = 10.73, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), consistent with Study 1. There were no accuracy differences in Response Type in the reward-seeking context (t(498) = 1.95, p = 0.21; Fig. 9).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Depressive symptom scores and active response accuracy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used a linear mixed model to examine whether depressive symptoms (BDI-II, z-normalized, grand-mean centered) predicted accuracy on active trials (also z-normalized). Fixed effects included Sex (female, male), Task Stage (acquisition, intermixed), and Motivational Context (reward-seeking, avoidance), with Participant as a random intercept. This structure matched Study 1, with motivational context added. Motivational Context significantly influenced accuracy, with lower performance on avoidance trials (avoidance; β =−0.307, SE = 0.075, t(978) = −4.11, p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, BDI-II symptom scores were not significantly associated with active accuracy (β = 0.035, SE = 0.063, t(1,050.90) = 0.56, p = 0.85), nor did they interact with Motivational Context (avoidance; β = 0.038, SE = 0.076, t(978) = 0.496, p = 0.85). Thus, although avoidance reduced active accuracy this effect was not associated with depressive symptom scores. Full model results can be found at https://osf.io/5sepm/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether observed effects were sensitive to reference level selection, we conducted an exploratory series of eight linear mixed models, systematically varying the reference levels for Sex, Task Stage, and Motivational Context. This resulted in 128 tested effects (16 per model, including main effects and interactions), and p values were adjusted using Benjamini–Hochberg FDR across all 128 effects. While no significant effects of BDI-II emerged in the initial model, exploratory analyses identified a significant BDI-II × Sex interaction (β = −0.365, SE = 0.121, t(1,050.90) = −3.02, padjusted = 0.026), specifically in the avoidance context during the intermixed stage. This exploratory finding suggests the possibility that sex differences in the relationship between depressive symptoms and instrumental behavior may emerge when active responses are well-learned and inhibitory demands are newly introduced—potentially reflecting sex-specific dynamics in threat processing during later phases of learning. Full model results can be found at https://osf.io/5sepm/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Depressive symptom scores and inhibitory response accuracy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar linear mixed model was used to examine whether depressive symptom scores (BDI-II, z-normalized) predicted accuracy on inhibitory trials. Fixed effects include Sex (female, male) and Motivational Context (reward-seeking, avoidance) and Participant as a random intercept. Motivational Context significantly affected inhibitory accuracy, with higher performance in the avoidance context (avoidance; β = 0.570, SE = 0.064, t(326) = 8.95, p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, BDI-II symptom scores were not significantly associated with inhibitory accuracy (β = −0.074, SE = 0.063, t(534.47) = −1.18, p = 0.28), nor was there a significant interact with BDI-II and Motivational Context (avoidance; β = 0.030, SE = 0.065, t(326) = 0.47, p = 0.64). Thus, although participants showed lower accuracy for inhibitory reward-seeking trials compared with avoidance trials, this pattern was not associated with depressive symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this study we report that higher depressive scores are associated with a reduced capacity to learn active avoidance behaviors, while no relationship was observed with inhibitory avoidance. Specifically, Study 1 extended rodent research on active and inhibitory avoidance to a human nonclinical sample, revealing that higher depressive symptoms predicted lower accuracy during the acquisition phase of active avoidance (Fig. 5) and a greater number of trials required to reach criterion performance (Fig. 4B). In contrast, depressive symptom scores were not related to performance on inhibitory avoidance trials. Additionally, within-subjects analyses indicated that overall, inhibitory avoidance was performed more readily compared with active avoidance, as indicated by higher accuracy during the intermixed and reversal stages (Fig. 3B,C). Altogether, these findings highlight a selective impairment in active avoidance learning associated with depressive symptoms and underscore the importance of considering how this relationship may vary across different learning phases. This dynamic pattern warrants further investigation into the underlying cognitive and neural processes that constrain avoidance behavior in depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our findings in Study 1 partially support the predictions of the ACDM framework, which posit that depression is associated with a greater tendency toward inaction in avoidance contexts (Bishop and Gagne, 2018). Using this framework, the decision to act is calculated as the difference between the product of estimated outcome value and probability and the estimated cost of deploying effort to obtain a desired outcome. In depression, inaction may arise from overestimating effort costs, undervaluing outcomes, or underestimating outcome probability. Notably, because our task used a deterministic reinforcement schedule, outcome uncertainty is unlikely to account for the observed deficit. If overestimation of effort costs were solely responsible for these deficits, one would expect consistent active avoidance impairments across all task stages. However, since effort demands remained constant (i.e., the number of button presses required to obtain the desired outcome) and inaction was most pronounced during the acquisition phase—when fatigue-related effort costs were likely minimal—alternative explanations must be considered. Another possibility is that individuals with elevated levels of depressive symptoms became increasingly sensitive to the aversive outcome over time—effectively overvaluing the punishment and potentially overriding initial biases against deploying effort. Consistent with this interpretation, several studies have demonstrated that individuals with depression show increased sensitivity to negative feedback (Elliott et al., 1997; Eshel and Roiser, 2010), particularly in probabilistic reversal learning tasks, where they are more likely to switch following misleading negative feedback (Murphy et al., 2003; Taylor Tavares et al., 2008). However, other work suggests that the negativity bias in depression may not reflect punishment hypersensitivity per se, but rather blunted responsiveness to reward, resulting in a relative overweighting of negative outcomes (Robinson et al., 2012). Still other studies have reported reduced sensitivity to both reward and punishment in depressed individuals (Mukherjee et al., 2020). This heterogeneity likely reflects differences in task structure (i.e., deterministic vs probabilistic reinforcement), cognitive control demands (i.e., attending to and memorizing cue–response associations), and sample characteristics such as comorbid anxiety, sex, IQ, and medication status. Regardless, our findings suggest that the relationship between depressive symptoms and active avoidance is dynamic, with experience-dependent shifts across phases of avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarifying how the neural circuits regulating active avoidance are dynamically engaged over time may offer critical insight into motivational dysfunction in depression. Evidence from both human and animal studies highlights the role of species-specific defensive reactions (SSDRs), where freezing is a prepotent response in aversive contexts (Bolles, 1970; Fanselow, 1994; LeDoux et al., 2017). For successful active avoidance, both humans and rodents must overcome these prepotent defensive responses to engage in instrumental, goal-directed action. From a neural circuitry perspective, considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the acquisition of active avoidance (LeDoux et al., 2017; Cain, 2019). Early in avoidance training, SSDRs are largely driven by amygdala circuits that promote behavioral suppression. With repeated training, however, ventromedial prefrontal systems (homologs of infralimbic cortex, Area 25 of anterior cingulate) increasingly suppress amygdala activity to reduce freezing and facilitate goal-directed avoidance responses (Moscarello and LeDoux, 2013). These dynamics suggest that individuals with elevated depressive symptoms may exhibit difficulty in suppressing prepotent defensive responses during early learning—potentially due to dysfunction in cortico-limbic-striatal circuits that support the shift from reactive to goal-directed control. This provides a plausible neurobiological mechanism for the symptom-related impairments in active avoidance observed during the acquisition phase, while performance at later stages remains unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving to research in humans, the dual competition model (Pessoa, 2009) proposes the effects of emotionally salient stimuli on task performance depends both on the level of arousal evoked by a stimulus and on whether the stimulus aligns with or opposes the action tendency evoked by the stimulus. Prepotent behavioral responses to avoid punishment and approach reward, mediated in part by prefrontal regions, have been reliably observed in human neuroimaging studies (Guitart-Masip et al., 2012; Asci et al., 2019). In depression, disruptions in top-down regulatory control have been linked to reduced activity in dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, dmPFC) and rostral ACC (rACC), along with elevated and sustained amygdala activity in response to negative feedback or emotional salient stimuli (Siegle et al., 2007; Fales et al., 2008; Taylor Tavares et al., 2008). This pattern may indicate that emotionally salient cues disproportionately influence behavior due to weakened regulatory input from cognitive control systems. As a result, the capacity to override prepotent defensive responses—particularly during early stages of active avoidance learning—may be compromised in depression. Recent work further supports this interpretation, showing that reductions in GABA within the rACC were associated with decreased functional connectivity across cortico-striatal-limbic circuits in females with MDD (Ironside et al., 2021)—a finding especially relevant given our predominantly female sample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Avoidance mechanisms in depression and related disorders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To contextualize our findings, it is important to position them within the broader literature on avoidance across psychiatric disorders, highlighting key conceptual differences and points of convergence. For instance, many studies define avoidance as the decreased selection of high-loss options in probabilistic selection tasks—a definition that differs meaningfully from the framework used here but useful for understanding sensitivity to reward and negative feedback. Chase et al. (2010) used a probabilistic selection task to examine feedback learning in individuals with MDD and found reduced learning rates for both positive and negative feedback during training, particularly among individuals with higher anhedonia. This suggests blunted reinforcement learning rather than a valence-specific bias such as altered sensitivity to negative feedback. Nonetheless, this profile is consistent with our observed impairment in active avoidance acquisition, despite differences in task design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mukherjee et al. (2020) extended this work using probabilistic reversal learning and found that MDD patients—most of whom were medicated—selected fewer rich options following reversals and exhibited reduced win-stay behavior (i.e., less likely to repeat a rewarded choice), but no difference in lose-shift behavior (i.e., switching after punishment). If depression involved heightened punishment sensitivity, an increase in lose-shift behavior would be expected. The absence of this effect supports the idea of diminished reward sensitivity rather than increased responsiveness to punishment. This interpretation aligns with the possibility that symptom-related impairments in active avoidance reflect deficits in safety learning rather than heightened punishment sensitivity that interacts with effort-related biases. Safety learning—the process of learning about cues that predict the absence of threat (Laing et al., 2025)—has been shown to promote instrumental avoidance learning in animals and humans (Fernando et al., 2014; Fisher and Urcelay, 2024). Impaired learning of safety signals may contribute to reduced active avoidance performance, even in aversively motivated contexts. Given that safety learning is supported by amygdala and vmPFC circuitry (Kong et al., 2014), this may offer a more parsimonious explanation for acquisition-specific effects than models emphasizing the accumulation of punishment sensitivity and effort-related bias.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neuromodulator systems may further complicate interpretation, as both serotonin and dopamine are implicated in punishment and reward learning. SSRIs, commonly prescribed in MDD, are known to blunt negative feedback sensitivity (Herzallah et al., 2013). Supporting this, low doses of the antidepressant citalopram—which attenuate serotonin signaling—increase lose-shift behavior and sensitivity to punishment in both rodents and humans (Chamberlain et al., 2006; Bari et al., 2010). However, findings from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) populations highlight more nuanced effects of serotonergic modulation: Endrass et al. (2011) found greater sensitivity to negative feedback in medicated OCD patients with elevated depressive symptoms, but only after initial learning—consistent with the idea that punishment sensitivity may build with experience. In contrast, Palminteri et al. (2012) reported no valence-specific effects of medication status in OCD patients using a task previously linking dopamine to punishment learning (Palminteri et al., 2009).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motivational impairments similar to those in depression are also evident in schizophrenia, particularly in relation to altered dopamine signaling. In unmedicated patients, Reinen et al. (2016) found blunted prediction error BOLD signals in the striatum and mPFC for rewards, but intact response to punishment, suggesting D2 tone may selectively dampen reward while keeping punishment signaling intact. Similarly, Waltz et al. (2018) reported reduced differential activation to gain versus loss-avoidance in vmPFC, ACC, and ventral striatum (VS), with diminished activation in VS associated with higher negative symptom scores. Sex differences in dopaminergic responses to loss versus gain have also been observed. Using PET during the monetary incentive delay task, Hahn et al. (2021) found females exhibited heightened VS dopaminergic responses to punishment relative to gain. Together, these findings suggest that disrupted valuation and motivational processes, linked to both dopamine and serotonin signaling, may reflect cortico-striatal-limbic dysfunction as a transdiagnostic mechanism across conditions like OCD, schizophrenia, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, these studies underscore the dynamic nature of avoidance, which may shift with experience (i.e., acquisition, expression, habit) and neuromodulatory state. If punishment sensitivity increases with experience, it may eventually override early inaction driven by effort-related biases. Alternatively, if deficits are more prominent for reward-related signals, disrupted safety learning may play a greater role. Future computational modeling that integrates effort costs, punishment and reward sensitivity, and safety learning mechanisms will be critical for disentangling these processes and clarifying how depressive symptoms influence active avoidance behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Motivational context influences accuracy of instrumental actions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Study 2 examined whether poorer active avoidance performance reflect a general bias toward effort minimization or context-specific effects by assessing active and inhibitory responses across both reward-seeking and avoidance contexts. While depressive symptom scores were not significantly related to performance, robust within-subjects effects emerged. Participants performed more accurately on trials aligned with their prepotent tendencies—active reward-seeking and inhibitory avoidance—consistent with prior research demonstrating approach biases for reward and withdrawal biases for punishment (Crockett et al., 2009; Guitart-Masip et al., 2012; Mkrtchian et al., 2017; Asci et al., 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prefrontal regions such as the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) and orbitofrontal (OFC) are implicated in overcoming these motivational-action conflicts (Roelofs et al., 2009; Volman et al., 2011). If the poorer performance for active versus inhibitory avoidance observed in Study 1 were driven by a general preference to minimize effort, we would expect a similar pattern for active reward-seeking in Study 2. However, this pattern did not emerge, suggesting that effort bias alone does not account for these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parallel findings in humans and animals suggest that newly learned discriminative cues can differentially influence instrumental behavior depending on whether the context is appetitive or aversive (Talmi et al., 2008; Geurts et al., 2013; Mkrtchian et al., 2017; Nord et al., 2018; Campese, 2021). Consistent with this, participants in the current study more readily inhibited responses in avoidance context than in reward-seeking contexts. Remarkably, rats display similar patterns, with greater accuracy for active responses during reward seeking and greater inhibitory accuracy during avoidance (Dalton et al., 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although these performance differences could be attributed to differences in the motivational value of the reward and the punishment outcomes, this explanation is unlikely. No significant main effect of motivational context was found during the intermixed task stage. Specifically, the average accuracy for reward-seeking and avoidance trials (irrespective of response type) did not differ. This suggests that the outcomes were equally motivating overall and not biased toward one context. Instead, the observed interaction is more consistent with the context-dependent effect of prepotent response tendencies influencing instrumental actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While depression is typically associated with reduced reward-seeking, the ACDM framework predicts a broader bias toward inaction across both reward-seeking and avoidance contexts, driven by overestimation of effort costs. In Study 1, higher depressive symptom scores were associated with reduced active avoidance performance—consistent with this framework. However, contrary to our hypotheses, depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with active or inhibitory response accuracy in either motivational context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several key differences may account for these null findings. First, the mixed-motivation task employed an interleaved design, requiring participants to frequently switch between responding to appetitive and aversive stimuli, rather than engaging with each in distinct blocks. This design placed avoidance trials within a broader reward-rich context, attenuating depression-related impairments in active avoidance—potentially due to the prepotent tendency to approach reward. This interpretation aligns with findings from approach-avoidance conflict paradigms—where conditions involving potential reward despite the risk of punishment are more likely to elicit active approach behavior than avoidance-only conditions (Aupperle et al., 2011). Second, the four-condition task structure (active vs inhibitory and reward-seeking vs avoidance) likely imposed greater working memory demands, which have been implicated in reward/punishment learning (Van Der Schaaf et al., 2014). These cognitive demands may have masked the influence of depressive symptoms on performance. Future studies may consider controlling for cognitive load to better isolate symptom-specific effects. Finally, Study 1 took place during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a contextual factor that may have influenced affective states and task engagement in ways that were not present during Study 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although no association between depressive symptoms were found in Study 2, the robust within-subjects effects suggest this task may be useful for assessing motivated behavior in other psychiatric populations. For example, research on substance use disorder emphasizes the strong motivational salience of reward and punishment related cues, particularly those associated with drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although depression is often linked with reward-processing deficits like anhedonia (Treadway and Zald, 2011; Treadway et al., 2012), our findings reveal a novel link between symptom severity and impaired active avoidance learning in aversive contexts. A key limitation is whether these results generalize to clinical populations. Depression is increasingly understood as a dimensional condition, with clinical diagnoses reflecting the more severe end of a broader symptom spectrum and avoidance impairments representing a potential transdiagnostic feature (Eaton et al., 2023). Our sample included a wide range of depressive symptom scores, with many participants self-reporting prior diagnoses or scoring above clinical cutoffs, supporting the relevance of our findings to clinical populations. Furthermore, this dimensional approach may offer a more nuanced understanding of symptom-related effects on avoidance behavior and extend to other psychiatric conditions, such as OCD and schizophrenia, that share overlapping motivational and affective features with depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another limitation of our study was the higher than expected exclusion rates, which warrant a closer examination of their potential impact on results. Both tasks were designed as reinforcement-based learning paradigms with minimal instructions, no explicit information on cue–response contingencies, and no practice trials. While this design enhances translational relevance, it likely contributed to the variability in participants’ ability to acquire the task contingencies. Although higher exclusion rates were anticipated, the rates observed—39.37% in Study 1 and 57.20% in Study 2—exceeded expectations and were primarily due to failure to meet behavioral performance criteria. However, when considering only exclusions related to questionnaire failures or task noncompletion, rates were consistent with typical online studies (Study 1: 19.17%, Study 2: 19.20%; Suzuki et al., 2021). To assess potential bias, we compared included participants to those who passed attention checks but were later excluded for other reasons (see https://osf.io/5sepm/). In Study 1, excluded participants had significantly higher BAI scores, but not BDI-II scores. While the ACDM framework does not explicitly make predictions about how depressive and anxiety symptoms interact, it implies that their effects may counterbalance one another. In the context of our study, anxiety symptoms could offset the depressive impairments in active avoidance by promoting increased avoidance effort. This antagonistic dynamic suggests that higher exclusion rates may have reduced confounding influences rather than introduce bias. Importantly, BDI-II scores did not differ between included and excluded groups, preserving the validity of our primary analyses. Sex differences in exclusion rates were also observed, with a higher proportion of females excluded. However, both final samples remained predominantly female—the group in which we observed our strongest effects—suggesting any bias would likely underestimate, rather than inflate our findings. For these reasons, we believe the interpretation and relevance of our findings are still valid. However, future adaptations of this task may benefit from optimizing the trade-off between ecological validity and participant retention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across two studies, we sought to extend rodent research to investigate patterns of active and inhibitory avoidance and reward-seeking in a nonclinical sample varying in depressive symptoms. By integrating self-report and behavioral measures, we aimed to strengthen translational links between preclinical models and depressive symptom severity in humans. Our findings highlight the value of transdiagnostic approaches in a community sample for bridging bench and clinic in understanding psychiatric disorders. Results demonstrate an important link between depressive symptoms and reduced efficacy at learning to override a prepotent response to inhibit action to avoid unpleasant events. Future work should test whether these effects replicate in clinically diagnosed MDD populations, use computational models to probe underlying mechanisms, and apply neuroimaging to evaluate cross-species convergence in neural circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Scoop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic is in the midst of a splashy media tour in Washington, but its refusal to allow its models to be used for some law enforcement purposes has deepened hostility to the company inside the Trump administration, two senior officials told Semafor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic recently declined requests by contractors working with federal law enforcement agencies because the company refuses to make an exception allowing its AI tools to be used for some tasks, including surveillance of US citizens, said the officials, who spoke to Semafor on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tensions come at a moment when Donald Trumpâs White House has championed American AI companies as patriotic bulwarks of global competition âÂ and expect the companies to repay that loyalty. The officials said they worried that Anthropic was selectively enforcing its policies based on politics and using vague terminology to allow its rules to be interpreted broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, Anthropic currently limits how the FBI, Secret Service and Immigration, and Customs Enforcement can use its AI models because those agencies conduct surveillance, which is prohibited by Anthropicâs usage policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the officials said Anthropicâs position, which has long been in effect, amounts to making a moral judgment about how law enforcement agencies do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The policy doesnât specifically define what it means by âdomestic surveillanceâ in a law enforcement context and appears to be using the term broadly, creating room for interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other AI model providers also list restrictions on surveillance, but offer more specific examples and often have carveouts for law enforcement activities. OpenAIâs policy, for instance, prohibits âunauthorized monitoring of individuals,â implying consent for legal monitoring by law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Know More&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropicâs decision to limit how law enforcement and national security agencies use its models has turned into a headache for some private contractors that work with those agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs because in some cases, Anthropicâs Claude models â available through Amazon Web Services GovCloud system â are the only top-tier models cleared for top secret security situations, the officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic has a specific service aimed at national security customers and struck a deal with the federal government to offer its services to government agencies for $1 fee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic also does work with the US Department of Defense, although its policies still prohibit the use of its models for making weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic has clashed with Trump administration officials in the past, when it opposed a proposed law that would have preempted US states from passing AI regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reedâs view&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropicâs kerfuffle with law enforcement contractors âÂ coming as larger rivals like Google have quietly backed off attempts to enforce progressive politics through their corporate policies âÂ raises a difficult question for the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley: How much should software providers be able to control how their products are used, particularly once they are sold into government agencies?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, an agency could pay for a subscription or negotiate a pay-per-use contract with an AI provider, only to find out that it is prohibited from using the AI model in certain ways, limiting its value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional software isnât like that. Once a government agency has access to Microsoft Office, it doesnât have to worry about whether it is using Excel to keep track of weapons or pencils.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs also just been generally frowned upon in the government contracting world to âpick and chooseâ how software can be used. But activist employees over the last decade also often pressed their employers to stay out of the defense industry in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tensions between Anthropic and the White House are part of a broader battle between the AI âsafetyâ movement, which has allies at the independent AI startup, and many of its rivals and the Republican administration, which prefer to move faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing protecting Anthropic in all this is that its models perform extremely well. Eventually, though, its politics could end up hurting its government business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published on September 17, 2025 by Andreas Rossberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, version 2.0 of the Wasm standard was (essentially) finished, which brought a number of new features, such as vector instructions, bulk memory operations, multiple return values, and simple reference types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the Wasm W3C Community Group and Working Group have not been lazy. Today, we are happy to announce the release of Wasm 3.0 as the new “live” standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a substantially larger update: several big features, some of which have been in the making for six or eight years, finally made it over the finishing line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;64-bit address space. Memories and tables can now be declared to use &lt;code&gt;i64&lt;/code&gt; as their address type instead of just &lt;code&gt;i32&lt;/code&gt;. That expands the available address space of Wasm applications from 4 gigabytes to (theoretically) 16 exabytes, to the extent that physical hardware allows. While the web will necessarily keep enforcing certain limits — on the web, a 64-bit memory is limited to 16 gigabytes — the new flexibility is especially interesting for non-web ecosystems using Wasm, as they can support much, much larger applications and data sets now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple memories. Contrary to popular belief, Wasm applications were always able to use multiple memory objects — and hence multiple address spaces — simultaneously. However, previously that was only possible by declaring and accessing each of them in separate modules. This gap has been closed, a single module can now declare (define or import) multiple memories and directly access them, including directly copying data between them. This finally allows tools like wasm-merge, which perform “static linking” on two or more Wasm modules by merging them into one, to work for all Wasm modules. It also paves the way for new uses of separate address spaces, e.g., for security (separating private data), for buffering, or for instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Garbage collection. In addition to expanding the capabilities of raw linear memories, Wasm also adds support for a new (and separate) form of storage that is automatically managed by the Wasm runtime via a garbage collector. Staying true to the spirit of Wasm as a low-level language, Wasm GC is low-level as well: a compiler targeting Wasm can declare the memory layout of its runtime data structures in terms of struct and array types, plus unboxed tagged integers, whose allocation and lifetime is then handled by Wasm. But that’s it. Everything else, such as engineering suitable representations for source-language values, including implementation details like method tables, remains the responsibility of compilers targeting Wasm. There are no built-in object systems, nor closures or other higher-level constructs — which would inevitably be heavily biased towards specific languages. Instead, Wasm only provides the basic building blocks for representing such constructs and focuses purely on the memory management aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typed references. The GC extension is built upon a substantial extension to the Wasm type system, which now supports much richer forms of references. Reference types can now describe the exact shape of the referenced heap value, avoiding additional runtime checks that would otherwise be needed to ensure safety. This more expressive typing mechanism, including subtyping and type recursion, is also available for function references, making it possible to perform safe indirect function calls without any runtime type or bounds check, through the new &lt;code&gt;call_ref&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tail calls. Tail calls are a variant of function calls that immediately exit the current function, and thereby avoid taking up additional stack space. Tail calls are an important mechanism that is used in various language implementations both in user-visible ways (e.g., in functional languages) and for internal techniques (e.g., to implement stubs). Wasm tail calls are fully general and work for callees both selected statically (by function index) and dynamically (by reference or table).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exception handling. Exceptions provide a way to locally abort execution, and are a common feature in modern programming languages. Previously, there was no efficient way to compile exception handling to Wasm, and existing compilers typically resorted to convoluted ways of implementing them by escaping to the host language, e.g., JavaScript. This was neither portable nor efficient. Wasm 3.0 hence provides native exception handling within Wasm. Exceptions are defined by declaring exception tags with associated payload data. As one would expect, an exception can be thrown, and selectively be caught by a surrounding handler, based on its tag. Exception handlers are a new form of block instruction that includes a dispatch list of tag/label pairs or catch-all labels to define where to jump when an exception occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relaxed vector instructions. Wasm 2.0 added a large set of vector (SIMD) instructions, but due to differences in hardware, some of these instructions have to do extra work on some platforms to achieve the specified semantics. In order to squeeze out maximum performance, Wasm 3.0 introduces “relaxed” variants of these instructions that are allowed to have implementation-dependent behavior in certain edge cases. This behavior must be selected from a pre-specified set of legal choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deterministic profile. To make up for the added semantic fuzziness of relaxed vector instructions, and in order to support settings that demand or need deterministic execution semantics (such as blockchains, or replayable systems), the Wasm standard now specifies a deterministic default behavior for every instruction with otherwise non-deterministic results — currently, this includes floating-point operators and their generated NaN values and the aforementioned relaxed vector instructions. Between platforms choosing to implement this deterministic execution profile, Wasm thereby is fully deterministic, reproducible, and portable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Custom annotation syntax. Finally, the Wasm text format has been enriched with generic syntax for placing annotations in Wasm source code. Analogous to custom sections in the binary format, these annotations are not assigned any meaning by the Wasm standard itself, and can be chosen to be ignored by implementations. However, they provide a way to represent the information stored in custom sections in human-readable and writable form, and concrete annotations can be specified by downstream standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to these core features, embeddings of Wasm into JavaScript benefit from a new extension to the JS API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these new features, Wasm has much better support for compiling high-level programming languages. Enabled by this, we have seen various new languages popping up to target Wasm, such as Java, OCaml, Scala, Kotlin, Scheme, or Dart, all of which use the new GC feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of all these goodies, Wasm 3.0 also is the first version of the standard that has been produced with the new SpecTec tool chain. We believe that this makes for an even more reliable specification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wasm 3.0 is already shipping in most major web browsers, and support in stand-alone engines like Wasmtime is on track to completion as well. The Wasm feature status page tracks support across engines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a guest post from Jiebin Sun, Zhiguo Zhou, Wangyang Guo and Tianyou Li, performance optimization engineers at Intel Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel's latest processor generations are pushing the number of cores in a server to unprecedented levels - from 128 P-cores per socket in Granite Rapids to 288 E-cores per socket in Sierra Forest, with future roadmaps targeting 200+ cores per socket. These numbers multiply on multi-socket systems, such servers may consist of 400 and more cores. The paradigm of "more, not faster cores" is driven by physical limitations. Since the end of Dennard scaling in the mid-2000s, power density concerns made it increasingly difficult to push single-thread performance further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For analytical databases like ClickHouse, ultra-high core counts represent a huge opportunity and a complex challenge at the same time. While more cores theoretically mean more power to process tasks in parallel, most databases struggle to utilize the available hardware fully. Bottlenecks for parallel processing like lock contention, cache coherence, non-uniform memory access (NUMA), memory bandwidth, and coordination overhead become significantly worse as the core count increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Optimizing for ultra-high core counts #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years, I dedicated a part of my professional life to understand and optimize ClickHouse's scalability on Intel Xeon ultra-high core count processors. My work focused on using various profiling and analysis tools - including perf, emon, and Intel VTune - to analyze all 43 ClickBench queries on ultra-high core count servers systematically, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing the ClickHouse accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results have been exciting: individual optimizations routinely deliver speedups of multiple times for individual queries, in some cases up to 10x. The geometric mean of all 43 ClickBench queries consistently improved between 2% and 10% per optimization. The results demonstrate that ClickHouse can be made scale very well on ultra-high core count systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The core scaling challenge #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond single-thread performance, several key challenges must be addressed to optimize performance in ultra-high core count systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cache coherence overhead: Bouncing cache lines costs CPU cycles.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lock contention: Amdahl's Law becomes brutal for serialized code sections as little as 1% of the overall code.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Memory bandwidth: Utilizing the memory bandwidth effectively is a persistent challenge for data-intensive systems. Proper memory reuse, management and caching becomes critical.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Thread coordination: The cost of synchronizing threads grows super-linearly with the number of threads.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;NUMA effects: The memory latency and bandwidth on multi-socket systems differs for local or remote memory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blog post summarizes our optimizations for ClickHouse on ultra-high core count servers. All of them were merged into the main codeline and they now help to speed up queries in ClickHouse deployments around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware setup: Our work was conducted on Intel's latest generation platforms, including 2 x 80 vCPUs Ice Lake (ICX), 2 x 128 vCPUs Sapphire Rapids (SPR), 1 x 288 vCPUs Sierra Forest (SRF), and 2 x 240 vCPUs Granite Rapids (GNR). SMT (Hyper-threading) was enabled, except on SRF which doesn't support SMT, and high-memory-bandwidth configurations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software setup: We used perf, Intel VTune, pipeline visualization, and other custom profiling infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The five optimization areas #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a systematic analysis of ClickHouse's performance on ultra-high core count systems, I identified five areas with a high potential for optimization. Each area addresses a different aspect of scalability, and together they form a comprehensive approach to unlocking the full potential of ultra-high core count systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My journey began with the most fundamental challenge: lock contention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bottleneck 1: Lock contention #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to queue theory, if N threads compete for the same lock, the cycles grows quadratically (N^2). For example, if we go from 8 to 80 cores, lock wait times increase by (80/8)² = 100x. Furthermore, cache coherence traffic for the mutex itself grows linearly with the core count, and the overhead for context switching compounds the problem. In such settings, every mutex becomes a potential scalability obstacle, and seemingly innocent synchronization patterns can bring entire systems to their knee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key insight is that lock contention isn't just about removing locks - it's about rethinking more fundamentally how threads coordinate and share state. This requires a multi-pronged approach: reducing the duration of critical sections, replacing exclusive locks (mutexes) with more granular synchronization primitives, and in some cases, eliminating shared state entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optimization 1.1: Query condition cache (PR #80247) #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After resolving jemalloc page faults (an optimization detailed below), a new hotspot appeared in &lt;code&gt;native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath&lt;/code&gt; which consumed 76% of the CPU time. This function was called from &lt;code&gt;QueryConditionCache::write&lt;/code&gt; on 2×240 vCPU systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the query condition cache?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClickHouse’s query condition cache stores the results of WHERE filters, enabling the database to skip irrelevant data. In each SELECT query, multiple threads check if cache entries must be updated based on different criteria:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;the hash of the filter condition (as cache key)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;the read mark ranges&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;whether the currently read part has a final mark&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The query condition cache is read-heavy, i.e. there are far more reads than writes, but the original implementation used exclusive locking for all operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing critical paths in read-heavy workloads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This optimization demonstrates the importance of reducing the time spent holding locks, especially write locks in read-heavy code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 240 threads within a single query, the original code created a perfect storm:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unnecessary write locks: All threads acquired exclusive locks, even when they only read cache entries.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Long critical sections: Expensive updates of cache entries were performed inside exclusive locks.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Redundant work: Multiple threads updated the same cache entries potentially multiple times.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our optimization uses double-checked locking with atomic operations to resolve these bottlenecks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The code now first checks with atomic reads (no locking), respectively under a shared lock if an update is needed at all (fast path).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Next, the code checks immediately after acquiring an exclusive lock (slow path) if an update is actually required - another thread may have performed the same update in the meantime.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on PR #80247, the optimization introduces a fast path which checks if an update is needed before acquiring the expensive write lock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// Original code
void updateCache(mark_ranges, has_final_mark)
{
    acquire_exclusive_lock(cache_mutex);  /// 240 threads wait here!

    /// Always update marks, even if already in desired state
    for (const auto &amp;amp; range : mark_ranges)
        set_marks_to_false(range.begin, range.end);

    if (has_final_mark):
        set_final_mark_to_false();

    release_lock(cache_mutex);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;
/// Optimized code
void updateCache(mark_ranges, has_final_mark)
{
    /// Fast path: Check if update is needed with a cheap shared lock
    acquire_shared_lock(cache_mutex);  /// Multiple threads can read simultaneously

    need_update = false;
    for (const auto &amp;amp; range : mark_ranges)
    {
        if (any_marks_are_true(range.begin, range.end))
        {
            need_update = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (has_final_mark &amp;amp;&amp;amp; final_mark_is_true())
        need_update = true;

    release_shared_lock(cache_mutex);

    if (!need_update)
        return;  /// Early out - no expensive lock needed!

    /// Slow path: Actually need to update, acquire exclusive lock
    acquire_exclusive_lock(cache_mutex);

    /// Double-check: verify update is still needed after acquiring lock
    need_update = false;
    for (const auto &amp;amp; range : mark_ranges)
    {
        if (any_marks_are_true(range.begin, range.end))
        {
            need_update = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (has_final_mark &amp;amp;&amp;amp; final_mark_is_true())
        need_update = true;

    if (need_update)
    {
        // Perform the actual updates only if still needed
        for (const auto &amp;amp; range : mark_ranges)
            set_marks_to_false(range.begin, range.end);

        if (has_final_mark)
            set_final_mark_to_false();
    }

    release_lock(cache_mutex);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance impact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optimized code delivered impressive performance improvements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;CPU cycles spend for &lt;code&gt;native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath&lt;/code&gt;reduced from 76% to 1%&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The QPS of ClickBench queries Q10 and Q11 improved by 85% and 89%&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The geometric mean of all ClickBench queries improved by 8.1%&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optimization 1.2: Thread-Local Timer ID (PR #48778) #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClickHouse's query profiler was frequently creating and deleting a global timer_id variable, causing lock contention during query profiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Query profiler timer usage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClickHouse's query profiler uses POSIX timers to sample thread stacks in periodic intervals for performance analysis. The original implementation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;created and deleted timer_id frequently during profiling, and&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;required global synchronization for all operations that read or write the timer.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usage of shared data structures that needed protection with locks caused significant overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminating global state with thread-local storage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we eliminated lock contention by thread-local storage, removing the need for shared state. Now, each thread has its own timer_id. This avoids shared state and the overhead of thread synchronization. To update a timer, it is no longer required to acquire locks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical solution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// Original code
class QueryProfiler
{
    static global_mutex timer_management_lock

    void startProfiling()
    {
        timer_id = create_new_timer();  /// Expensive system call

        acquire_exclusive_lock(timer_management_lock);  /// Global lock!
        update_shared_timer_state(timer_id);  /// Modify shared state

    }

    void stopProfiling()
    {
        acquire_exclusive_lock(timer_management_lock);
        cleanup_shared_timer_state(timer_id);
        release_lock(timer_management_lock);

        delete_timer(timer_id);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// Optimized code
class QueryProfiler
{
    static thread_local timer_id per_thread_timer;
    static thread_local boolean timer_initialized;

    void startProfiling()
    {
        if (!timer_initialized)
        {
            per_thread_timer = create_new_timer();  /// Once per thread
            timer_initialized = true;
        }

        /// Reuse existing timer - no locks, no system calls!
        enable_timer(per_thread_timer);
    }

    void stopProfiling()
    {
        /// Just disable timer - no deletion, no locks!
        disable_timer(per_thread_timer);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance impact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new implementation has the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;It eliminated timer-related lock contention hotspots from profiling traces&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It reduced timer create/delete system calls through reuse&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It makes profiling on ultra-high core count servers more scalable.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thread-local storage can eliminate lock contention by removing the need for shared state. Global synchronization becomes unnecessary if threads maintain their own state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bottleneck 2: Memory management #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory optimization on ultra-high core count systems differs a lot from single-threaded memory management. Memory allocators themselves become contention points, memory bandwidth is divided across more cores, and allocation patterns that work fine on small systems can create cascading performance problems at scale. It is crucial to be mindful of how much memory is allocated and how memory is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This class of optimizations involves the allocator’s behavior, reducing pressure on memory bandwidth, and sometimes completely rethinking algorithms to eliminate memory-intensive operations altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optimization 2.1: Jemalloc Memory Reuse Optimization (PR #80245) #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This optimization is motivated by high page fault rates and excessive resident memory usage which we observed for certain aggregation queries on ultra-high core count systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding two-level hash tables in ClickHouse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregation in ClickHouse uses different hash tables, depending on the data type, data distribution and data size. Large aggregation states are maintained in ephemeral hash tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The 1st level consists of 256 static buckets, each pointing to a 2nd level hash table.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;2nd level hash tables grow independently of each other.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory reuse for two-level hash tables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of an aggregation query, all hash tables used by the query are deallocated. In particular, the 256 sub-hash tables are deallocated and their memory is merged into larger free memory blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;jemalloc (as ClickHouse’s memory allocator) unfortunately prevented the reuse of merged memory blocks for future smaller allocations. This is because by default, only memory from blocks up to 64x larger than the requested size can be reused. This issue in jemalloc is very subtle but critical on ultra-high core count systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on jemalloc issue #2842, we noticed a fundamental problem with jemalloc’s memory reuse for the irregularly-sized allocations typical in two-level hash tables:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Extent management issue: When large allocations are freed, jemalloc fails to efficiently track and reuse these memory extents.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Size class fragmentation: Memory gets trapped in size classes that don't match future allocation patterns.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Metadata overhead: Excessive metadata structures prevent efficient memory coalescing.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Page fault amplification: New allocations trigger page faults instead of reusing existing committed pages.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified jemalloc's &lt;code&gt;lg_extent_max_active_fit&lt;/code&gt; parameter as the root cause - it was too restrictive for ClickHouse's allocation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We contributed the fix to jemalloc PR #2842, but jemalloc didn’t have new stable releases for an extended period. Fortunately, we could resolve this issue through jemalloc's configuration parameters at compilation time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on ClickHouse PR #80245, the fix involved tuning jemalloc's configuration parameters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// Original jemalloc configuration
JEMALLOC_CONFIG_MALLOC_CONF = "oversize_threshold:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0,dirty_decay_ms:5000"
/// lg_extent_max_active_fit defaults to 6, meaning memory can be reused from extents up to 64x larger than the requested allocation size
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// Optimized jemalloc configuration
JEMALLOC_CONFIG_MALLOC_CONF = "oversize_threshold:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0,dirty_decay_ms:5000,lg_extent_max_active_fit:8"
/// lg_extent_max_active_fit is set to 8.
/// This allows memory reuse from extents up to 256x larger
/// than the requested allocation size (2^8 = 256x vs default 2^6 = 64x).
/// The 256x limit matches ClickHouse's two-level hash table structure (256 buckets).
/// This enables efficient reuse of merged hash table memory blocks.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance impact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optimization improved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;the performance of ClickBench query Q35 by 96.1%,&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;memory usage (VmRSS, resident memory) and page faults reduced for the same query went down by 45.4% and 71%, respectively.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior of the memory allocator can have a dramatic impact on ultra-high core count systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optimization 2.2: AST Query Rewriting for Memory Reduction (PR #57853) #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClickBench query Q29 was memory-bound and bottlenecked in excessive memory accesses caused by redundant computations of the form &lt;code&gt;sum(column + literal)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the memory bottleneck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClickBench query Q29 contains multiple sum expressions with literals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT SUM(ResolutionWidth), SUM(ResolutionWidth + 1), SUM(ResolutionWidth + 2),

The key insight is that many analytical queries contain patterns that can be algebraically simplified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optimization recognizes that &lt;code&gt;sum(column + literal)&lt;/code&gt; can be rewritten to &lt;code&gt;sum(column) + count(column) * literal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance impact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;ClickBench query Q29 sped up by 11.5x on a 2×80 vCPU system.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The geometric mean of all ClickBench queries saw a 5.3% improvement overall.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;More intelligent query plans can be more effective than optimizing execution itself. Avoiding work is better than doing work efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bottleneck 3: Increase parallelism #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast aggregation is a core promise of any analytical database. From a database perspective, aggregating data in parallel threads is only one part of the equation. It is equally important to merge the local results in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClickHouse's aggregation operator has two phases: In the first phase, each thread processes its portion of the data in parallel, creating a local and partial result. In the second phase, all partial results must be merged. If the merge phase is not properly parallelized, it becomes a bottleneck. More threads can actually make this issue worse by creating more partial results to merge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solving this issue requires careful algorithm design, smart data structure choices, and a deep understanding how hash tables behave under different load patterns. The goal is to eliminate the serial merge phase and enable linear scaling even for the most complex aggregation queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optimization 3.1: Hash Table Conversion (PR #50748) #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClickBench query Q5 showed a severe performance degradation as the core count increased from 80 to 112 threads. Our pipeline analysis revealed serial processing in the hash table conversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding hash tables in ClickHouse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClickHouse uses two types of hash tables for hash aggregation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Single-level hash tables: This is a flat hash table that is suitable (= faster) for smaller datasets.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Two-level hash tables: This is a hierarchical hash table with 256 buckets. Two-level hash tables are more amendable to large datasets.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database chooses the right hash table type based on the size of the processed data: Once a single-level hash table reaches a certain threshold during aggregation, it is automatically converted to a two-level hash table. The code to merge hash tables of different types was serialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The serial bottleneck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When merging hash tables from different threads,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;single-level hash tables were serially merged in a pair-wise manner, e.g. ht1 / ht2 → result, then result / ht3, etc.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;two-level hash tables are merged one-by-one as well but the merge is parallelized across buckets.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of mixed single/two-level hash tables, the single-level hash tables had to be converted to two-level hash tables first (this was a serial process). Once the was done, the resulting two-level hash tables could be merged in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Q5, increasing the number of threads from 80 to 112 meant that each thread processes less data. With 80 threads, all hash tables were two-level. With 112 threads, the aggregation ended up with the mixed scenario: some hash tables remained single-level while others became two-level. This caused serialization - all single-level hash tables had to be converted to two-level before parallel merging could take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To diagnose the issue, pipeline visualization was a crucial tool. The telltale sign was that the merge phase duration increased with thread count - this is the opposite of what should happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance degradation with increased core count&lt;/p&gt;Pipeline visualization (max_threads=80) - the merge phase is reasonable Pipeline visualization (max_threads=112) - the merge phase takes 3.2x longer&lt;p&gt;Our optimization parallelizes the conversion phase: instead of converting all single-level hash tables to two-level hash tables one by one (serially), we now convert them in parallel. As each hash table can be converted independently, this eliminates the serial bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// Original code
void mergeHashTable(left_table, right_table)
{
    if (left_table.is_single_level() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; right_table.is_two_level())    
        left_table.convert_to_two_level();  /// Serial conversion blocks threads

    /// Now merge
    merge_sets(left_table, right_table);
}

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance impact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The performance did not improve only for Q5 - the optimization enabled linear scaling for any aggregation-heavy query on ultra-high core count systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance improvement after parallel conversion - Q5 achieves 264% improvement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;ClickBench query Q5 improved by a 264% on a 2×112 vCPU system,&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;24 queries achieved &amp;gt;5% improvement,&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;the overall geometric mean improved by 7.4%&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optimization demonstrates that scalability isn't just about making things more parallel - it's about eliminating serial sections that grow with parallelism. Sometimes you need to restructure algorithms on a more deep level, not just add more threads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optimization 3.2: Single-Level Hash Table Merging (PR #52973) #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We noticed that the performance was also subpar when all hash tables were single-level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extending parallel merge to single-level cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on PR #50748, this optimization recognizes that the benefits of parallel merging are not limited to mixed hash tables. Even when all hash tables are single-level, parallel merging can improve performance if the total data size is large enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge was to determine when single-level hash tables should be merged in parallel parallel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If datasets are too small, parallelization introduces extra overhead.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If datasets are too large, parallelization may not be beneficial enough.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the implementation in PR #52973, the optimization added parallel merges to all single-level cases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// Before: Only parallelize mixed-level merges

Compilers are conservative about vectorization, and database workloads often have complex control flows that inhibit auto-vectorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective usage of SIMD instructions in databases requires thinking beyond traditional vectorization. Besides processing N data items simultaneously instead of one, one can also utilize parallel SIMD comparisons for smart pruning strategies which lead to less work done overall. This idea is particularly powerful for string operations. These are at the same time frequently used in practice and computationally expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optimization 4.1: Two-character SIMD string search (PR #46289) #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;String search (e.g. plain substring search or LIKE pattern search) is a bottleneck in a lot of queries, for example in ClickBench query Q20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding string search in analytical queries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clickbench query 20 evaluates a LIKE pattern on millions of URLs, making fast string search crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hits WHERE URL LIKE '%google%'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing false positives with two-character filtering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PR #46289 is based on the insight that SIMD instructions can be used in a smart way beyond brute-force parallelization. The original code already leveraged SIMD instructions but it only considered the search pattern’s first character, leading to expensive false positives. We rewrite the code to check the second character as well. This improved selectivity dramatically while adding only a negligible amount of new SIMD operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// Original code

The two-character approach shows how a small number of additional SIMD operations can in some cases yield massive performance gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bottleneck 5: False Sharing #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;False sharing occurs when multiple threads access variables in the same cache. The CPU's cache coherence protocol works at cache line granularity, meaning that any cache line modifications - including modifications of two different variables - are treated as conflicts which require expensive synchronization between cores. On a 2 x 240 vCPUs system, false sharing can turn simple counter increments into system-wide performance disasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminating false sharing requires how CPU cache coherence is implemented at the hardware level. It's not enough to optimize algorithms - to avoid false sharing, one must also optimize the memory layout to make sure that frequently-accessed data structures don't accidentally interfere with each other through cache line conflicts. This involves for example a strategic data layout and use of alignment and padding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optimization 5.1: Profile Event Counter Alignment (PR #82697) #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClickBench query Q3 showed 36.6% of CPU cycles spent in &lt;code&gt;ProfileEvents::increment&lt;/code&gt; on a 2×240 vCPU system. Performance profiling revealed a severe cache line contention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ProfileEvents counters at scale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profile event counters refer to ClickHouse's internal eventing system - profile events track all internal operations, from detailed query execution steps to memory allocations. In a typical analytical query, these counters are incremented millions of times across all threads. The original implementation organized multiple counters in the same memory region without considering cache line boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates three challenges:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cache line physics: Modern Intel processors use 64-byte cache lines. When any byte in a cache line is modified, the entire line must be invalidated in the other cores' caches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;False sharing amplification: With 240 threads, each counter update triggers a cache line invalidation across potentially dozens of cores. What should be independent operations become serialized through the cache coherence protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exponential degradation: As the number of cores increases, the probability of a simultaneous access to the same cache line grows exponentially, compounding the impact of cache misses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using perf, I discovered that &lt;code&gt;ProfileEvents::increment&lt;/code&gt; was generating massive cache coherence traffic. The smoking gun was the cache line utilization report that showed eight different counters packed into a single cache line. We also added new capabilities to Linux’s perf c2c tool and worked with the community to help developers more easily identify false sharing issues like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proper cache line alignment ensures that each counter gets its own 64-byte cache line. This transforms false sharing (bad) into true sharing (manageable). When a thread updates its counter, now only a single cache line wil be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our implementation in PR #82697, the fix improved the cache line alignment for the profile event counters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Before: Counters packed without alignment
struct ProfileEvents:
    atomic_value counters[NUM_EVENTS]  // Multiple counters per cache line
    // 8 counters sharing single 64-byte cache lines

// After: Cache line aligned counters  
struct ProfileEvents:
    struct alignas(64) AlignedCounter:
        atomic_value value
        // Padding automatically added to reach 64 bytes
    
    AlignedCounter counters[NUM_EVENTS]  // Each counter gets own cache line
    // Now each counter has exclusive cache line ownership
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance impact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This optimization pattern applies to any frequently updated shared and compact data structure. The lesson is that the memory layout becomes critical at scale - what works fine on eight cores can be excruciatingly slow on 240 cores.&lt;/p&gt;After optimization: ProfileEvents::increment drops to 8.5% (from 36.6%)&lt;p&gt;As a result of our optimization, ClickBench query Q3 saw a 27.4% improvement on ultra-high core count systems. The performance gain increases with the number of cores because the cache coherence overhead grows super-linearly.

As processors continue to evolve toward higher core counts, these techniques will become essential for any system that needs to scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our optimizations enable ClickHouse to achieve close-to-linear scalability as the core count increases. This enables ClickHouse to thrive as an analytics database in a future world where Intel and other hardware manufacturers push the core count into the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References and Resources #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Source Code: All optimizations available in ClickHouse main branch&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Slide Deck: 2025 Shanghai Meetup Presentation&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Pull Requests: Individual PRs linked throughout this post with detailed performance analysis&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Intel Intrinsics Guide: Intel® Intrinsics Guide&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Acknowledgments #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to the ClickHouse community for rigorous code review and performance validation.

    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR is the part in bold below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The field of psychology had a big crisis in the 2010s, when many widely accepted results turned out to be much less solid than previously thought. It's called the replication crisis, because labs around the world tried and failed to replicate, in new experiments, previous results published by their original "discoverers". In other words, many reported psychological effects were either non-existent—artifacts of the experimenter's flawed setup—or so much weaker than originally claimed that they lost most of their intellectual sparkle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(The crisis spanned other fields as well, but I mostly care about psychology here, especially the cognitive kind.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very old news, and I've been vaguely aware of several of the biggest disgraced results for years, but I keep on forgetting which are (still probably) real and which aren't. This is not good. Most results in the field do actually replicate and are robust[citation needed], so it would be a pity to lose confidence in the whole field just because of a few bad apples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is a compact reference list of the most (in)famous cognitive science results that failed to replicate and should, for the time being, be considered false. The only goal is to offset the trust-undermining effects of my poor memory—and perhaps yours, too?—with a bookmarkable page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can't be a comprehensive list: if a study is not on this page, it's not guaranteed to be fully replicated. Still, this should cover most of the high-profile debunked theories that laypeople like me may have heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Credit: I enlisted the help of Kimi K2, o3, and Sonnet 4 to gather and fact-check this list. I also checked, pruned, and de-hallucinated all the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ego Depletion Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: We have a "willpower battery" that gradually depletes during the day as we exercise self-control. (I remember reading Baumeister's pop-science book and being awed by the implications of their findings; I might have known it sounded too good to be true.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Baumeister et al. 1998&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replication status: did not replicate&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Power Posing Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: Adopting expansive body postures for 2 minutes (like standing with hands on hips or arms raised) increases testosterone, decreases cortisol, and makes people feel more powerful and take more risks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Carney, Cuddy, &amp;amp; Yap (2010)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replication status: did not replicate&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Social Priming: Elderly Words Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: People walk more slowly after being exposed to words related to elderly stereotypes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Bargh, Chen, &amp;amp; Burrows (1996)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replication status: did not replicate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Source: Doyen et al. (2012) (I like how they prove that the psychological effect was actually in the experimenters, rather than the subjects!)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Money Priming Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: Simply thinking about money makes you more selfish and more likely to endorse free market values.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Vohs, Mead, &amp;amp; Goode (2006)&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ESP Precognition Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: In some cases, people can predict future events "that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process".&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Bem (2011)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replication status: did not replicate&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cleanliness and Morality Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: Being clean or thinking about cleanliness makes people more morally lax.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Schnall, Benton, &amp;amp; Harvey (2008)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replication status: did not replicate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Source: Johnson, Cheung, &amp;amp; Donnellan (2014)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Glucose and Ego Depletion Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: Connected to the debunked ego-depletion effect, this one claims that adding glucose to your blood "recharges" the willpower battery. (For a while, I may have drunk more orange juice than usual after reading Baumeister's book. At least it's healthy-ish.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Gailliot &amp;amp; Baumeister (2007)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replication status: did not replicate&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hunger and Risk-Taking Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: People exposed to the scent of freshly baked cookies become less sensitive to risk and take more risks to obtain food.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Ditto et al. 2006&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Psychological Distance &amp;amp; Construal Level Theory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: "Psychologically distant" events are processed more abstractly, while "psychologically near" events are processed more concretely. E.g., you worry about the difficulty of a task if you have to do it tomorrow, but you see the same task's attractive side if it is planned far in the future.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Trope &amp;amp; Liberman (2010), building on Liberman &amp;amp; Trope (1998)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replication status: serious credibility problems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Source: A collaboration between 73 labs around the world is vetting this theory right now because of many doubts about its validity.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ovulation &amp;amp; Mate Preferences Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: Women are more attracted to hot guys during high-fertility days of their cycles.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Gildersleeve, Haselton, &amp;amp; Fales (2014)&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Marshmallow Test &amp;amp; Long-Term Success Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: Children's ability to resist eating a marshmallow when left alone in a room at age 4-5 strongly predicts adolescent achievement, with those who waited longer showing better life outcomes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Shoda, Mischel, &amp;amp; Peake (1990)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replication status: did not replicate significantly&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Stereotype Threat (Women's Math Performance) Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: Women risk being judged by the negative stereotype that women have weaker math ability, and this apprehension disrupts their math performance on difficult tests.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Spencer, Steele, &amp;amp; Quinn (1999)&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Smile to Feel Better Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: Holding a pen in your teeth (forcing a smile-like expression) makes you rate cartoons as funnier compared to holding a pen with your lips (preventing smiling). More broadly, facial expressions can influence emotional experiences: "fake it till you make it."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Strack, Martin, &amp;amp; Stepper (1988)&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: Listening to Mozart temporarily makes you smarter.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claimed result: Teaching students that intelligence is malleable (not fixed) dramatically improves academic performance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Dweck, &amp;amp; Leggett (1988)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replication status: mixed results - many failed replications but also some successful replications&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Representative paper: Bialystok, Craik, &amp;amp; Luk (2012)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replication status: did not replicate&lt;/item&gt;
