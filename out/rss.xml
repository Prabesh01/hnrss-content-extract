  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This little postage stamp is actually a full Raspberry Pi Zero 2, complete with eMMC storage and WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you can't get one. Well, not unless you buy the CM0NANO development board from EDAtec, or you live in China.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This little guy doesn't have an HDMI port, Ethernet, or even USB. It's a special version of the 'Compute Module' line of boards. Little Raspberry Pi 'System on Modules' (SoMs), they're called.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compute Modules are entire Linux computers about the size of a regular desktop CPU that you 'plug in' to another board, to give it life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compute modules are everywhere, in kiosks, signage, 3D printers, and even the new Ableton Move. If you just need a little bit of Linux for networking and remote control, these are perfect for that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the CM0 is now the smallest version, a little bigger than a postage stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But unlike all the other Compute Modules, the CM0 has castellated edges like a Pico. That way, a company integrating this into their product can just pick and place it and solder it onto their main PCB, instead of working with more delicate board-to-board connectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why is this only in China? I'll get to that, but first I wanted to thank EDAtec for sending a CM0 and their CM0NANO dev board for testing. Without them, I don't think I'd ever be able to show these Pis to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Video&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I posted this story to my YouTube channel, but if you're on the blog already, chances are you favor reading over video, so scroll on!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ED-CM0NANO&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDAtec's CM0NANO seems to be the official IO board for the CM0. It breaks out every feature on the RP3A0 chip at the heart of the Pi Zero 2 and CM0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's 10/100 Ethernet through a little USB to Ethernet chip (CoreChips SR9900A), two USB 2.0 ports, full-size HDMI, and USB-C for power and flashing the eMMC. Then there are display and camera connectors, GPIO, and a few more headers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To flash the onboard eMMC, I had to switch the &lt;code&gt;RPI_BOOT_SW&lt;/code&gt; switch towards the RTC battery slot, then use rpiboot to mount it on my Mac. Then I used Raspberry Pi Imager to flash Pi OS 13 on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The eMMC on here is very slow compared to what I'm used to with the Pi 5 generation, like on the CM5. Its top speed seems to be around 19-20 MB/sec.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once it's flashed, it's a full Linux computer, complete with Raspberry Pi's desktop environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDAtec has a firmware support package you can install from their package repository, and once that's done, I did what nobody should do on this small of a computer: fired up Chromium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browsing the web on here is almost completely out of the question, since it only has 512 Megs of RAM—which is so little it pops a warning saying Chromium should only be used with 1 GB of more of RAM!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did try browsing this website, and it took something like a minute to just quit the browser, after I was clicking the X to close the tab over and over again!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But with WiFi, Ethernet, USB, HDMI, and everything else the Pi ecosystem has to offer, some products that just want to slap a well-supported Linux environment on top of their product (and not integrate an SoC, memory, storage, and wireless chip) now have this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Global distribution possibilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do I think companies and makers here in the US and over in other parts of the world would also benefit from the CM0? Yes. Do I think it'll happen? Doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Zero 2 W and CM0 share something in common, besides their entire architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Zero 2 W was introduced at the beginning of the COVID-induced chip shortages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CM0 was introduced right before the great RAM shortages.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Hackster asked Eben Upton about global availability, he was noncommittal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No plans to make it available outside China at the moment, but we'll see how we get on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was back before the RAM shortages got bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I followed up asking a Pi engineer about it, and it sounds like one big problem is the RP3A0 chip that integrates an LPDDR2 RAM chip stacked on top of the Pi's SoC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said the CM0 would compete with Pi Zero 2 for LPDDR2 memory, which is in shorter supply these days (it's not being produced anymore, so stocks will only become more limited over time), and they want to make sure the popular Zero 2 W can stay in stock for makers and education.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CM0 is targeted squarely at the lower end market, integrated into products built on assembly lines. So because of that, it's anyone's guess if the CM0 will ever make it out of China.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not doing a full review of the board here, because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's practically the same as the Pi Zero 2 W, which I already reviewed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's not like you can get one (standalone, at least) anyway, at least not for the foreseeable future.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there was a chance, before the DRAM manufacturers went all-in on an AI cash grab, but for now, stick to the Pi Zero 2's that you're used to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find a little more detail and benchmark results on my sbc-reviews issue for the CM0.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Framework Raises DDR5 Memory Prices By 50% For DIY Laptops&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Framework Computer had worked to keep their memory prices lower than other laptop vendors amid the ongoing memory shortages throughput the industry worldwide. But today they've finally had to cave in and increase their DDR5 memory modules for the Framework Laptop DIY Editions by 50%. &lt;lb/&gt;Due to the ongoing price hikes around system memory with shortages throughout the supply chain, Framework raised their DDR5 memory options today by 50% for the Framework Laptop DIY Edition. Framework Computer is keeping the prior prices for existing pre-orders and also is foregoing any price changes for their pre-built laptops or the Framework Desktop. Framework Computer also lets you order DIY laptops without any memory at all if so desired for re-using existing modules or should you score a deal elsewhere.&lt;lb/&gt;Due to their memory pricing said to be more competitive below market rates, they also adjusted their return policy to prevent scalpers from purchasing DIY Edition laptops with memory while then returning just the laptops. The DDR5 must be returned now with DIY laptop order returns.&lt;lb/&gt;More details on Framework Computer needing to begin raising system memory prices can be found via the Framework Blog.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in April, District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers delivered a scathing judgment finding that Apple was in “willful violation” of her 2021 injunction intended to open up iOS App Store payments. That contempt of court finding has now been almost entirely upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, a development that Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney tells Ars he hopes will “do a lot of good for developers and start to really change the App Store situation worldwide, I think.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ruling, signed by a panel of three appellate court judges, affirmed that Apple’s initial attempts to charge a 27 percent fee to iOS developers using outside payment options “had a prohibitive effect, in violation of the injunction.” Similarly, Apple’s restrictions on how those outside links had to be designed were overly broad; the appeals court suggests that Apple can only ensure that internal and external payment options are presented in a similar fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The appeals court also agreed that Apple acted in “bad faith” by refusing to comply with the injunction, rejecting viable, compliant alternatives in internal discussions. And the appeals court was also not convinced by Apple’s process-focused arguments, saying the district court properly evaluated materials Apple argued were protected by attorney-client privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the district court barred Apple from charging any fees for payments made outside of its App Store, the appeals court now suggests that Apple should still be able to charge a “reasonable fee” based on its “actual costs to ensure user security and privacy.” It will be up to Apple and the district court to determine what that kind of “reasonable fee” should look like going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking to reporters Thursday night, though, Epic founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said he believes those should be “super super minor fees,” on the order of “tens or hundreds of dollars” every time an iOS app update goes through Apple for review. That should be more than enough to compensate the employees reviewing the apps to make sure outside payment links are not scams and lead to a system of “normal fees for normal businesses that sell normal things to normal customers,” Sweeney said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;String Theory Inspires a Brilliant, Baffling New Math Proof&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August, a team of mathematicians posted a paper claiming to solve a major problem in algebraic geometry — using entirely alien techniques. It instantly captivated the field, stoking excitement in some mathematicians and skepticism in others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result deals with polynomial equations, which combine variables raised to powers (like y = x or x2 − 3xy = z2). These equations are some of the simplest and most ubiquitous in mathematics, and today, they’re fundamental to lots of different areas of study. As a result, mathematicians want to study their solutions, which can be represented as geometric shapes like curves, surfaces and higher-dimensional objects called manifolds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are infinitely many types of polynomial equations that mathematicians want to tame. But they all fall into one of two basic categories — equations whose solutions can be computed by following a simple recipe, and equations whose solutions have a richer, more complicated structure. The second category is where the mathematical juice is: It’s where mathematicians want to focus their attention to make major advances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after sorting just a few types of polynomials into the “easy” and “hard” piles, mathematicians got stuck. For the past half-century, even relatively simple-looking polynomials have resisted classification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then this summer, the new proof appeared. It claimed to end the stalemate, offering up a tantalizing vision for how to classify lots of other types of polynomials that have until now seemed completely out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that no one in the world of algebraic geometry understands it. At least, not yet. The proof relies on ideas imported from the world of string theory. Its techniques are wholly unfamiliar to the mathematicians who have dedicated their careers to classifying polynomials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some researchers trust the reputation of one of the paper’s authors, a Fields medalist named Maxim Kontsevich. But Kontsevich also has a penchant for making audacious claims, giving others pause. Reading groups have sprung up in math departments across the world to decipher the groundbreaking result and relieve the tension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This review may take years. But it’s also revived hope for an area of study that had stalled. And it marks an early victory for a broader mathematical program that Kontsevich has championed for decades — one that he hopes will build bridges between algebra, geometry and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The general perception,” said Paolo Stellari, a mathematician at the University of Milan who was not involved in the work, “is that we might be looking at a piece of the mathematics of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Rational Approach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The effort to classify all polynomials deals with the oldest kind of math: solving equations. To solve the simple polynomial y = 2x, for instance, you just need to find values of x and y that satisfy the equation. There are infinitely many solutions to this equation, such as x = 1, y = 2. When you graph all the solutions in the coordinate plane, you get a line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other polynomials are harder to solve directly, and their solutions cut out more complicated, higher-dimensional shapes in space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for some of these equations, it turns out, there’s a really simple way to find every possible solution. Instead of separately plugging different numbers into each variable, you can get all the solutions at once by rewriting the variables in terms of a new variable, t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the polynomial x2 + y2 = 1, which defines a circle. Now set x equal to 2t/(1 + t2), and y equal to (1 − t2)/(1 + t2). When you plug these new formulas back into your original equation, you get 1 = 1, a statement that’s always true, no matter what t is. This means that by choosing any real-number value for t, you’ll instantly get a solution to the original polynomial. For instance, when you set t equal to 1, you get x = 2(1)/(1 + (1)2) = 1, and y = 0. And indeed, x = 1, y = 0 is a solution to the original equation: (1)2 + (0)2 = 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This straightforward way of framing all your solutions is called a rational parameterization. It’s equivalent to mapping every point on the graph of your original polynomial — in this case, a circle — to a unique point on a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any degree-1 polynomial equation — that is, any polynomial whose terms are raised to a power of at most 1 — can be parameterized like this. It doesn’t matter how many variables the equation has: It might have two variables, or 200. Once you go beyond two variables, the solutions to your polynomial equation will form complicated higher-dimensional shapes. But because the polynomial can still be parameterized, there’s a way to map every point in your high-dimensional shape to points on a particularly simple space in the same number of dimensions (like the line). This, in turn, gives you a straightforward way to compute all the polynomial’s solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, any degree-2 polynomial (whose terms are raised to a power of at most 2) has a rational parameterization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if an equation’s degree is 3 or more, it can’t always be parameterized. It depends on how many variables the equation has.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a typical kind of degree-3 polynomial: elliptic curves, like y2 = x3 + 1, which have only two variables. “Elliptic curves are glorious, they’re wonderful, but you can’t possibly parameterize them,” said Brendan Hassett of Brown University. There’s no simple formula for x and y that gives you all of an elliptic curve’s solutions, so there’s no way to map the curve to a straight line. “If you could, they would not be so much fun,” Hassett said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, the solutions to an elliptic curve have a far richer structure — one that’s played a vital role in number theory for centuries, and that cryptographers have taken advantage of to encode secret messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about degree-3 equations with more variables, then? Are they parameterizable, or is the structure of their solutions more fun, the way it is for elliptic curves?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1866, the German mathematician Alfred Clebsch showed that degree-3 equations with three variables — whose solutions form two-dimensional surfaces — are usually parameterizable. More than a century later, Herbert Clemens and Phillip Griffiths published a monumental proof in which they showed that the opposite is true for most degree-3 equations with four variables. These equations, which form three-dimensional manifolds called three-folds, are not parameterizable: Their solutions can’t be mapped to a simple 3D space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many mathematicians suspected that the next polynomial to be classified — degree-3 equations with five variables (forming four-dimensional manifolds known as four-folds) — wouldn’t usually be parameterizable either. In fact, they figured that polynomials should never be parameterizable past a certain point. But Clemens and Griffiths’ techniques didn’t work for four-folds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so for decades, the classification effort lay dormant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Converting a Prophet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians were surprised when, at a conference in Moscow in the summer of 2019, Maxim Kontsevich got up to speak about classifying four-folds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one thing, Kontsevich is known for taking a high-level approach to mathematics, preferring to pose ambitious conjectures and sketch out broad programs, often leaving the subtler details and formal proof-writing to others. He’s described himself as something between a prophet and a daydreamer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;©IHES/Flann Mérer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past three decades, he’s been focused on developing a program called homological mirror symmetry, which has its roots in string theory. In the 1980s, string theorists wanted to count the number of curves on high-dimensional manifolds to answer questions about how the building blocks of the universe might behave. To count the curves on a given manifold, they considered its “mirror image” — another manifold that, though very different from the original, had related properties. In particular, they found that an algebraic object associated to the mirror image, called a Hodge structure, could reveal the number of curves on the original manifold. The reverse was also true: If you count the curves on the mirror image, you’ll get information about the original manifold’s Hodge structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1994, Kontsevich sketched out a program to explain the underlying reason for this correspondence. His program also predicted that the correspondence extended to all kinds of manifolds beyond those relevant to string theory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, no one knows how to prove Kontsevich’s mirror symmetry program. “It will be next-century mathematics,” he said. But over the years, he’s made partial progress toward a proof — while also exploring the program’s potential consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2002, one of Kontsevich’s friends, Ludmil Katzarkov of the University of Miami, hypothesized one such consequence: that the program might be relevant to the classification of polynomial equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Katzarkov was familiar with Clemens and Griffiths’ 1972 proof that three-folds aren’t parameterizable. In that work, the pair looked at a given three-fold’s Hodge structure directly. They then used it to show that the three-fold couldn’t be mapped to a simple 3D space. But the Hodge structures associated with four-folds were too complicated to analyze using the same tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Katzarkov’s idea was to access the four-fold’s Hodge structure indirectly — by counting how many curves of a particular type lived on its mirror image. Typically, mathematicians studying the Hodge structures of four-folds don’t think about curve counts like these: They only come up in seemingly unrelated areas of math, like string theory. But if the mirror symmetry program is true, then the number of curves on the mirror image should illuminate features of the original four-fold’s Hodge structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Natalia Leal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular, Katzarkov wanted to break the mirror image’s curve count into pieces, then use the mirror symmetry program to show that there was a corresponding way to break up the four-fold’s Hodge structure. He could then work with these pieces of the Hodge structure, rather than the whole thing, to show that four-folds can’t be parameterized. If any one of the pieces couldn’t be mapped to a simple 4D space, he’d have his proof.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this line of reasoning depended on the assumption that Kontsevich’s mirror symmetry program was true for four-folds. “It was clear that it should be true, but I didn’t have the technical ability to see how to do it,” Katzarkov said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He knew someone who did have that ability, though: Kontsevich himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But his friend wasn’t interested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Digging In&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, Katzarkov tried to convince Kontsevich to apply his research on mirror symmetry to the classification of polynomials — to no avail. Kontsevich wanted to focus on the whole program, not this particular problem. Then in 2018, the pair, along with Tony Pantev of the University of Pennsylvania, worked on another problem that involved breaking Hodge structures and curve counts into pieces. It convinced Kontsevich to hear Katzarkov out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Katzarkov walked him through his idea again. Immediately, Kontsevich discovered an alternative path that Katzarkov had long sought but never found: a way to draw inspiration from mirror symmetry without actually relying on it. “After you’ve spent years thinking about this, you see it happening in seconds,” Katzarkov said. “That’s a spectacular moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kontsevich argued that it should be possible to use the four-fold’s own curve counts — rather than those of its mirror image — to break up the Hodge structure. They just had to figure out how to relate the two in a way that gave them the pieces they needed. Then they’d be able to focus on each piece (or “atom,” as they called it) of the Hodge structure separately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the plan Kontsevich laid out for his audience at the 2019 conference in Moscow. To some mathematicians, it sounded as though a rigorous proof was just around the corner. Mathematicians are a conservative bunch and often wait for absolute certainty to present new ideas. But Kontsevich has always been a little bolder. “He’s very open with his ideas, and very forward-thinking,” said Daniel Pomerleano, a mathematician at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, who studies mirror symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a major ingredient they still had no idea how to address, Kontsevich warned: a formula for how each atom would change as mathematicians tried to map the four-fold to new spaces. Only with such a formula in hand could they prove that some atom would never reach a state corresponding to a properly “simplified” four-fold. This would imply that four-folds weren’t parameterizable, and that their solutions were rich and complicated. “But people somehow got the impression that he said it was done,” Pomerleano said, and they expected a proof soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When that didn’t come to pass, some mathematicians began to doubt that he had a real solution. In the meantime, Tony Yue Yu, then at the French National Center for Scientific Research, joined the team. Yu’s fresh insights and meticulous style of proof, Kontsevich said, turned out to be crucial to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When lockdowns began during the Covid pandemic, Yu visited Kontsevich at France’s nearby Institute for Advanced Scientific Studies. They relished the quiet of the deserted institute, spending hours in lecture halls where there were more blackboards, Yu recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meeting regularly with Pantev and Katzarkov over Zoom, they quickly completed the first part of their proof, figuring out precisely how to use the number of curves on a given four-fold to break its Hodge structure into atoms. But they struggled to find a formula to describe how the atoms could then be transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What they didn’t know was that a mathematician who had attended Kontsevich’s lecture in Moscow — Hiroshi Iritani of Kyoto University — had also started pursuing such a formula. “He was enchanted by my conjecture,” Kontsevich said. “I didn’t know, but he started to work on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In July 2023, Iritani proved a formula for how the atoms would change as four-folds were mapped to new spaces. It didn’t give quite as much information as Kontsevich and his colleagues needed, but over the next two years, they figured out how to hone it. They then used their new formula to show that four-folds would always have at least one atom that couldn’t be transformed to match simple 4D space. Four-folds weren’t parameterizable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Still Processing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the team posted their proof in August, many mathematicians were excited. It was the biggest advance in the classification project in decades, and hinted at a new way to tackle the classification of polynomial equations well beyond four-folds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But other mathematicians weren’t so sure. Six years had passed since the lecture in Moscow. Had Kontsevich finally made good on his promise, or were there still details to fill in?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And how could they assuage their doubts, when the proof’s techniques were so completely foreign — the stuff of string theory, not polynomial classification? “They say, ‘This is black magic, what is this machinery?’” Kontsevich said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Suddenly they come with this completely new approach, using tools that were previously widely believed to have nothing to do with this subject,” said Shaoyun Bai of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “The people who know the problem don’t understand the tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bai is one of several mathematicians now trying to bridge this gap in understanding. Over the past few months, he has co-organized a “reading seminar” made up of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and professors who hope to make sense of the new paper. Each week, a different mathematician digs into some aspect of the proof and presents it to the rest of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even now, after 11 of these 90-minute sessions, the participants still feel lost when it comes to major details of the proof. “The paper contains brilliant original ideas,” Bai said, which “require substantial time to absorb.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar reading groups have been congregating in Paris, Beijing, South Korea and elsewhere. “People all over the globe are working on the same paper right now,” Stellari said. “That’s a special thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hassett likens it to Grigori Perelman’s 2003 proof of the Poincaré conjecture, which also used entirely new techniques to solve a famous problem. It was only after other mathematicians reproduced Perelman’s proof using more traditional tools that the community truly accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There will be resistance,” Katzarkov said, “but we did the work, and I’m sure it’s correct.” He and Kontsevich also see it as a major win for the mirror symmetry program: While they’re not closer to proving it, the result provides further evidence that it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m very old, and very tired,” Katzarkov said. “But I’m willing to develop this theory as long as I’m alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Secondary school maths showing that AI systems don’t think&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a time when many young people are using AI for personal and learning purposes, schools are trying to figure out what to teach about AI and how (find out more in this summer 2025 data about young people’s usage of AI in the UK). One aspect of this is how technical we should get in explaining how AI works, particularly if we want to debunk naive views of the capabilities of the technology, such as that AI tools ‘think’. In this month’s research seminar, we found out how AI contexts can be added to current classroom maths to make maths more interesting and relevant while teaching the core concepts of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At our computing education research seminar in July, a group of researchers from the CAMMP (Computational and Mathematical Modeling Program) research project shared their work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prof. Dr. Martin Frank, Founder of CAMMP (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assistant Prof. Dr. Sarah Schönbrodt (University of Salzburg, Austria)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Research Associate Stephan Kindler (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They talked about how maths already taught in secondary schools can be used to demystify AI. At first glance, this seems difficult to do, as it is often assumed that school-aged learners will not be able to understand how these systems work. This is especially the case for artificial neural networks, which are usually seen as a black box technology — they may be relatively easy to use, but it’s not as easy to understand how they work. Despite this, the Austrian and German team have developed a clear way to explain some of the fundamental elements of AI using school-based maths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarah Schönbrodt started by challenging us to consider that learning maths is an essential part in developing AI skills, as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI systems using machine learning are data-driven and are based on mathematics, especially statistics and data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Authentic machine learning techniques can be used to bring to life existing classroom maths concepts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real and relevant problems and associated data are available for teachers to use&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A set of workshops for secondary maths classrooms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarah explained how the CAMMP team have developed a range of teaching and learning materials on AI (and beyond) with an overall goal to “allow students to solve authentic, real and relevant problems using mathematical modeling and computers”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She reflected that much of school maths is set in contexts that are abstract, and may not be very interesting or relevant to students. Therefore, introducing AI-based contexts, which are having a huge impact on society and students’ lives, is both an opportunity to make maths more engaging and also a way to demystify AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workshops designed and researched by the team include contexts such as privacy in social networks to learn about decision trees, personalised Netflix recommendations to learn about k-nearest neighbour, word predictions to learn about N-Grams, and predicting life expectancy to learn about regression and neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Learning about classification models: traffic lights and the support vector machine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the seminar, Sarah walked through the steps to learn about support vector machines. This is an upper secondary workshop for students aged 17 to 18 years old. The context of the lesson is an image problem — specifically, classifying the data representing the colours of a simplified traffic light system (two lights to start with) to work out if a traffic light is red or green.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She walked through each of the steps of the maths workshop:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plotting data points of two classes, the representation of green and red traffic lights&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding a line that best separates the data points of both classes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Figuring out what best is&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Classifying the data points in relation to the chosen (separating) line&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Validating the model statistically to see if it is useful in classifying new data points, including using test data and creating a contingency table (also called a confusion matrix)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discussing limitations, including social and ethical issues&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Explaining how three traffic lights can be expressed as three-dimensional data by using planes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout the presentation, Sarah pointed out where the maths taught was linked to the Austrian and German mathematics curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Learning about social and ethical issues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as learning about lines, planes, distances, dot product and statistical measures, learners are also engaged in discussing the social and ethical issues of the approach taken. They are encouraged to think about bias, data diversity, privacy, and the impact of errors on people. For example, if the model wrongly predicts a light as green when it is red, then an autonomous car would run through a red traffic light. This would likely be a bigger consequence than stopping at a green traffic light that was mis-predicted as red. So should the best line reduce this kind of error?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To teach the workshops, Sarah explained they have developed interactive Jupyter notebooks, where no programming skills are needed. Students fill in the gaps of example code, explore simulations, and write their ideas for discussion for the whole class. No software needs to be installed, feedback is direct, and there are in-depth tasks and staggered hints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Learning about regression models: Weather forecasting and the toy artificial neural network&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephan went on to introduce artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are the basis of generative AI applications like chatbots and image generation systems. He focused on regression models, such as those used in weather forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ANNs are very complex. Therefore, to start to understand the fundamentals of this technology, he introduced a ‘toy ANN’ with one input, three nodes, and one output. A function is performed on the input data at each node. With the toy network, the team wants to tackle a major and common misconception: that students think that ANN systems learn, recognise, see, and understand, when really it’s all just maths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The learning activity starts by looking at one node with one input and one output, and can be described as a mathematical function, with a concatenation of two functions (in this case a linear and activation function). Stephan shared an online simulator that visualises how the toy neural network can be explored as students change two parameters (in this case, weight and bias of the functions). Students then look at the overall network, and the way that the output from the three nodes is combined. Again, they can explore this in the simulator. Students compare simple data about weather prediction to the model, and discover they need more functions — more nodes to better fit the data. The activity helps students learn that ANN systems are just highly adjustable mathematical functions that, by adding nodes, can approximate relationships in a given data set. But the approximation only works in the bounds (intervals) in which data points are given, showing that ANNs do not ‘understand’ or ’know’ — it’s just maths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephen finished by explaining the mutual benefits of AI education and maths education. He suggested maths will enable a deeper understanding of AI, and give students a way to realistically assess the opportunities and risks of AI tools and show them the role that humans have in designing AI systems. He also explained that classroom maths education can benefit from incorporating AI contexts. This approach highlights how maths underpins the design and understanding of everyday systems, supports more effective teaching, and promotes an interdisciplinary way of learning across subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some personal reflections — which may not be quite right!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been researching the teaching of AI and machine learning for around five years now, since before ChatGPT and other similar tools burst on the scene. Since then, I have seen an increasing number of resources to teach about the social and ethical issues of the topic, and there are a bewildering number of learning activities and tools for students to train simple models. There are frameworks for the data lifecycle, and an emerging set of activities to follow to prepare data, compare model types, and deploy simple applications. However, I felt the need to understand and to teach about, at a very simple level, the basic building blocks of data-driven technologies. When I heard the CAMMP team present their work at the AIDEA conference in February 2025, I was entirely amazed and I asked them to present here at our research seminar series. This was a piece of the puzzle that I had been searching for — a way to explain the ‘bottom of the technical stack of fundamental concepts’. The team is taking very complex ideas and reducing them to such an extent that we can use secondary classroom maths to show that AI is not magic and AI systems do not think. It’s just maths. The maths is still hard, and teachers will still need the skills to carefully guide students step by step so they can build a useful mental model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we can simplify these ideas further, and create unplugged activities, simulations, and ways for students to explore these basic building blocks of data representation, as well as classification and representing approximations of complex patterns and prediction. I can sense the beginnings of new ideas in computational thinking, though they’re still taking shape. We’re researching these further and will keep you updated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Finding out more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to find out more about the CAMMP resources, you can watch the seminar recording, look at the CAMMP website or try out their online materials. For example, the team shared a link to the jupyter notebooks they use to teach the workshops they demonstrated (and others). You can use these with a username of ‘cammp_YOURPSEUDONYM’, where you can set ‘YOURPSEUDONYM’ to any letters, and you can choose any password. They also shared their toy ANN simulation.&lt;lb/&gt;The CAMMP team are not the only researchers who are investigating how to teach about AI in maths lessons. You can find a set of other research papers here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Join our next seminar&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our current seminar series, we’re exploring teaching about AI and data science. Join us at our last seminar of the series on Tuesday, 27 January 2026 from 17:00 to 18:30 GMT to hear Salomey Afua Addo talk about using unplugged approaches to teach about neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;async dns&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;curl experimented with using pthread_cancel to timeout async DNS requests and it blew up. What else can we do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity, I decided to review some alternatives and see how they work. My personal priorities are control over events; no background threads or signals or secret mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;getaddrinfo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tried and true classic technique is to call getaddrinfo in a thread. Probably with more than one thread so you don’t get stuck behind a single slow request, but probably not boundless either. You can also use a separate process if you don’t use threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is probably good enough for many uses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;getaddrinfo_a&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;glibc provides getaddrinfo_a which basically does the thread dance for you. Some of it. It comes with some caveats, and it’s distinctly non portable, and probably doesn’t mesh with your idea of an event loop. Passing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;c-ares&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;c-ares is a standalone DNS library. It supports async queries via a threaded backend or an event driven system. I think the thread backend has the same issues, in that it uses a callback and then you need to push the results back into your application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, the event system uses lots of callbacks as well. This also includes some dire warnings in the documentation. “When the associated callback is called, it is called with a channel lock so care must be taken to ensure any processing is minimal to prevent DNS channel stalls.” Everyone knows the ideal callback just sets a flag, etc., but also everyone is inevitably tempted to do just one more thing, and hey look, it works fine, wait, why did it break. And thus I have a strong preference for library interfaces where you call into it, get some results, but any time you’re in your own code, you’re free to do what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But worth a try. Based on the sample code I wrote the quickest dirtiest demo I could.&lt;/p&gt;

                if (!state.pfds[i].revents)
                    continue;
                events[nevents].fd = state.pfds[i].fd;
                events[nevents].events = 0;
                if (state.pfds[i].revents &amp;amp; (POLLERR|POLLHUP|POLLIN))

            }
            ares_process_fds(channel, events, nevents, 0);
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;It’s okay, but the callbacks are annoying. Notifying me which descriptors need watching means I’m required to pack up my poll structure so I can access it in the callbacks, etc. Everything gets bound just a little bit tighter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;wadns&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the alternatives the c-ares project helpfully lists, is dns.c. This sounds enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the downside, it’s not clear where the demo code stops and the functional code begins. As in, there’s a getaddrinfo sample, but it incorporates a lot of other code that doesn’t seem to be public. The public header doesn’t actually expose a means to interface with an event loop. The code is meant to be integrated into a project, which is understandable and even advantageous, but it means no demo today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;asr&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The asr code was written for smtpd in OpenBSD. It doesn’t use threads and requires the caller to push events. Unfortunately, a portable version currently only exists in the OpenSMTPD repo. On the plus side, it’s used as the basis for the libc resolver in OpenBSD, which means the “sample” code to replace getaddrinfo literally is getaddrinfo.c.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I rewrote the c-ares demo to use asr. It comes out quite a bit shorter, and I think clearer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new Japanese law is going into effect that could loosen the dominance of tech giants over smartphone services. It aims to bring users greater choice for app stores and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting December 18, firms like Apple and Google will be prohibited from blocking third party app stores on iPhone and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The law also aims to loosen their grip on web browsers and search. The firms will now be required to give first-time users multiple choices for default services. This also applies when people update their operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fair Trade Commission says the changes will improve convenience by encouraging new market entrants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But some public comments released by the commission expressed concern that the legislation could undermine user security.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European Economic &lt;lb/&gt;and Social Committee&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nuclear energy key to decarbonising Europe, says EESC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EESC has adopted an opinion pointing out that nuclear energy is an essential component of the clean energy mix which is needed to phase out fossil fuels. The Committee calls on the European Commission to include key regulatory and financial enablers in order to make the planned investment possible, and to enhance transparent dialogue with civil society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear energy plays and will continue to play a crucial role in decarbonising the European Union, says the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) in an opinion adopted at the December plenary session. This is particularly true given the fact that the EU needs to consolidate its strategic autonomy in the fields of energy and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EESC opinion, drawn up by rapporteur Dumitru Fornea and co-rapporteur Alena Mastantuono, assesses the European Commission’s 8th Nuclear Illustrative Programme (PINC), published in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the Committee, nuclear energy is a key element in diversifying the EU’s energy supply because it delivers safe, reliable, low-carbon electricity. This ensures that the grid remains stable most of the time, regardless of the weather or time of day, with less pressure on systemic costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear energy can therefore play an important role in supporting the EU’s overall industrial transition as it bolsters resilience against supply disruptions while complementing renewables and reducing dependence on imported fuels. Against this backdrop, existing EU industries (such as steel, cement and chemicals) as well as new industries (data centres) can enjoy a constant stream of decarbonised electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘The European nuclear industry sustains more than 1.1 million jobs in the EU and is a significant economic sector with a major footprint in terms of jobs, supply chain capacity and advanced R&amp;amp;D. It is a net-zero value chain based almost entirely in the EU,’ said Mr Fornea. ‘If we want to effectively move away from coal, we need accessible clean energy and funding for nuclear.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Moving ahead with planned investment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the opinion, the EESC regrets that the PINC does not propose any specific enablers, nor a real action plan, for the planned investment and urges the European Commission to include regulatory and financial measures. The goal is to enable investment in the sector, promote the development of innovative fuel cycle facilities and propose specific figures on the investment required by the nuclear fuel cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘We call on the Commission to put forward concrete measures to make the investment planned under the PINC possible,’ said Ms Mastantuono. ‘This is more necessary than ever given the geopolitical turmoil which is forcing the Union to develop EU-based capacities. For this reason, the nuclear value chain should be supported in terms of skills, research and the fuel supply chain.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More specifically, the Committee recommends speeding up investment through specific measures such as a streamlined State aid process, access to EU cohesion funds, sustainable financing, licensing processes and faster decisions at EU and national level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, the EESC advises applying the same facilities to investment in nuclear energy as for renewables. These two energy sources are complementary and Member States are free to choose their own energy mix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Keeping transparent dialogue open with civil society&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dialogue with civil society remains pivotal in building trust, ownership and societal acceptance, and could be more prominently addressed in the PINC. Moreover, there is no dedicated funding available for meaningful civil society participation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this matter, the EESC’s view is that decisions on new projects in the nuclear sector, including the development of new technologies, should be taken following the outcome of a broad and transparent dialogue with civil society on the technical, economic, social and environmental aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public engagement is essential to ensure that energy strategies reflect societal priorities (such as sustainability, reliability, land-use and responsibility for long-term waste management) and the early involvement of civil society through dialogue strengthens trust and legitimacy for both nuclear energy and other low-carbon technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background - Nuclear Illustrative Programme (PINC)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to article 40 of the Euratom Treaty, the European Commission is required to periodically publish a Nuclear Illustrative Programme (PINC) and consult the EESC. The Commission Communication on the PINC issued in June 2025 has therefore been presented under this article for the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PINC provides a comprehensive overview of investment needs in nuclear energy, both fission and fusion, and encompasses all stages of the nuclear lifecycle. It also feeds into the debate on the role of nuclear energy in achieving carbon neutrality in the EU by 2050. In line with the highest level of nuclear safety, the PINC supports EU competitiveness, energy security and affordable energy prices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 8th PINC, the Commission points out that nuclear energy requires significant investment, of around EUR 241 billion until 2050, both for lifetime extensions of existing reactors and the construction of new large-scale reactors. The Commission also says that additional investment is needed for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs) and microreactors and in fusion for the longer-term future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google has made its ‘next generation brand typeface’, Google Sans Flex, available for download — under an open source license, which is welcome news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A modern sans serif font purpose-designed for use on screens and OSes, Google Sans Flex is a ground-up, multi-axis rebuild of the proprietary Google Sans font, by typographer David Berlow (of Font Bureau fame).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “flex” in GS Flex is because it’s a variable font that is “extremely flexible [with] variable axes for weight, width, optical size, slant, as well as an axis for rounded terminals” (as in terminals in letters, not command-line apps).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Android and web developers will find the varied variable axes on offer a creative boon for “expressive” design work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changing system font is a simple way to give Ubuntu (or any other Linux) desktop a subtle new vibe without having to futz around with themes, icon packs or other eye-candy extras which substantially alter the stock experience:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Linux desktop environments don’t yet support doing anything fancy with variable fonts, beyond the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ergo, unlike on modern Android, you can’t toggle Dark Mode in GNOME or KDE with this font enabled to make it automatically adjust its GRAD axis to compensate for the optical thinning that typically occurs when white text is rendered against darker backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not a major drawback, and GS Flex works great as a competent, classy system UI font on Linux, especially on HiDPI displays with fractional scaling. For my tastes, Google Sans Flex has (like GNOME’s default Adwaita Sans font) more presence than the Ubuntu font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to try it out? Google has released the font under the SIL Open Font License (OFL), meaning you can modify, redistribute and use it in your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go to Google Fonts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search for ‘Google Sans Flex’&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hit “Get Font” &amp;gt; “Download All”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extract the ZIP&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find the .ttf file inside and either: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Move it to &lt;code&gt;~/.local/share/fonts&lt;/code&gt;; or&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Install via your desktop’s font manager GUI&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Move it to &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once installed it’ll be available to use/select in other apps, settings and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To change UI font on Ubuntu you can install the GNOME Tweaks tool and then open it, go to Appearance and set the UI font to Google Sans Flex. Although you may see variable options listed to pick from, GNOME will always render the ‘regular’ version.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A security researcher said Home Depot exposed access to its internal systems for a year after one of its employees published a private access token online, likely by mistake. The researcher found the exposed token and tried to privately alert Home Depot to its security lapse but was ignored for several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exposure is now fixed after TechCrunch contacted company representatives last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security researcher Ben Zimmermann told TechCrunch that, in early November, he found a published GitHub access token belonging to a Home Depot employee, which was exposed sometime in early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he tested the token, Zimmermann said that it granted access to hundreds of private Home Depot source code repositories hosted on GitHub and allowed the ability to modify their contents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researcher said the keys allowed access to Home Depot’s cloud infrastructure, including its order fulfillment and inventory management systems, and code development pipelines, among other systems. Home Depot has hosted much of its developer and engineering infrastructure on GitHub since 2015, according to a customer profile on GitHub’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zimmermann said he sent several emails to Home Depot but didn’t hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nor did he get a response from Home Depot’s chief information security officer, Chris Lanzilotta, after sending a message over LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zimmermann told TechCrunch that he has disclosed several similar exposures in recent months to companies, which have thanked him for his findings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Home Depot is the only company that ignored me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that Home Depot does not have a way to report security flaws, such as a vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program, Zimmermann contacted TechCrunch in an effort to get the exposure fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When reached by TechCrunch on December 5, Home Depot spokesperson George Lane acknowledged receipt of our email but did not respond to follow-up emails asking for comment. The exposed token is no longer online, and the researcher said the token’s access was revoked soon after our outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also asked Lane if Home Depot has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if anyone else used the token during the months it was left online to access any of Home Depot’s internal systems. We did not hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Windows 3.1 included a red and yellow 'Hot Dog Stand' color scheme so garish it was long assumed to be a joke, so I tracked down Microsoft's original UI designer to get the true story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setting the record straight, 33 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every so often, a wonderful thing happens: someone young enough to have missed out on using computers in the early 1990s is introduced to the Windows 3.1 "Hot Dog Stand" color scheme. Back in the day Windows was pretty plain looking out of the box, with grey windows and blue highlights as the default. A number of optional color palettes gave it a bit more pep, like the wine-tinged Bordeaux or the more sophisticated teal of Designer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then there was Hot Dog Stand, which more or less turned Windows into a carnival.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The truly funny thing about this color scheme is that all the other Windows 3.1 color schemes are surprisingly rational, totally reasonable color schemes," tech blogger Jeff Atwood wrote back in 2005. "And then you get to 'Hot Dog Stand. Which is utterly insane. … I have to think it was included as a joke."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you read the comments to Atwood's article, you'll see some speculation that it's actually great if you're color blind, and then you'll see that speculation debunked. You'll also find a comment from a year later, in 2006, claiming that the creator of the scheme "presented a great seminar on UI design" at a conference in 1997. "She claimed that Hot Dog was a challenge from the Windows 3.1 team to come up with the worst scheme possible," wrote commenter PJ14.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did Windows 3.1 really ship with a garish color scheme that was dared into being? That was a story I needed to hear, so I went digging for the credits of the Microsoft employees who worked on the user interface back then and found my way to Virginia Howlett, who joined Microsoft in 1985 as the company's first interface designer, and worked there up through the launch of Windows 95.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Howlett also co-created the font Verdana, which is partially named after her daughter Ana and is up there with Helvetica as one of the most-used fonts of the last 30 years. But enough about her world-changing contributions to modern technology: we're here to talk Hot Dog Stand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I confess that I'm surprised anyone cares about Windows 3.1 in late 2025! It was such a long time ago and the world has changed so much," Howlett told me when I reached out over email. She confirmed that she and a "small team of designers" created Windows 3.1's themes, which were a "radically new" feature at the time—prior to its release, you couldn't customize different parts of the OS, like the backgrounds and title bars of windows, with different colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked if the designers at Microsoft really had included Hot Dog Stand as a joke, or if it was inspired by a particular stand they frequented near the corporate campus (hey, it was a longshot, but you never know). I'll let Virginia tell the rest of the story:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I recall there were 16 colors: white, black, gray, RGB, CMY, and the dark versions of those colors—so dark red, dark green, dark blue, dark cyan, dark magenta, dark yellow, dark gray. (Normal people might call some of these colors teal, navy, burgundy, etc.) Much of the user interface was black lines on a white background and used 2 shades of gray to create 3-D buttons: 'affordances.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We designed a long list of themes using those 16 colors. No one today seems interested in 'Bordeaux' or 'Tweed' or 'Arizona.' We were covering all the bases, hoping to come up with color schemes that would appeal to a broad range of people. 'Hot Dog Stand' used bright yellow and red.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been mystified about why that particular theme causes so much comment in the media. Maybe it's partly the catchy name. (Never underestimate the power of a good brand name!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do remember some discussion about whether we should include it, and some snarky laughter. But it was not intended as a joke. It was not inspired by any hot dog stands, and it was not included as an example of a bad interface—although it was one. It was just a garish choice, in case somebody out there liked ugly bright red and yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 'Fluorescent' theme was also pretty ugly, but it didn't have a catchy name, so I've never heard anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm really glad that 'Hot Dog Stand' has entertained so many people for so many years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With regards to design historians everywhere,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Virginia Howlett&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As delightfully garish as Hot Dog Stand is, Howlett is right that it's far from the only eye searing theme in the Windows 3.1 collection. Check out Fluorescent and Plasma Power Saver:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can play around with Windows 3.1 in your browser thanks to the emulator PCjs Machines; if you get really into it, you can even customize every color yourself instead of relying on one of the preset themes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that's that: Hot Dog Stand may have inadvertently served as a warning to aspiring theme customizers that madness was just a few overzealous color choices away, but that wasn't its original intent. It wasn't included on the floppy disks as a dare, or a joke—it just happened to end up one of the funniest and most memorable relics of Windows history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Virginia Howlett recently guested on an episode of the design podcast Complementary, so give it a listen if you'd like to hear her talk about interface design and her time at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wes has been covering games and hardware for more than 10 years, first at tech sites like The Wirecutter and Tested before joining the PC Gamer team in 2014. Wes plays a little bit of everything, but he'll always jump at the chance to cover emulation and Japanese games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he's not obsessively optimizing and re-optimizing a tangle of conveyor belts in Satisfactory (it's really becoming a problem), he's probably playing a 20-year-old Final Fantasy or some opaque ASCII roguelike. With a focus on writing and editing features, he seeks out personal stories and in-depth histories from the corners of PC gaming and its niche communities. 50% pizza by volume (deep dish, to be specific).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, founders are not adopting Bryan Johnson’s regimen to reverse aging. Quite the opposite : the average founder raising capital ages six months every year.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect founder age has been increasing steadily for three reasons. First, venture capital has shifted toward AI, which grew from roughly 10% to 60% of investment in just three years.2 AI founders skew older. Many AI labs are started by PhDs who spent extended periods in school &amp;amp; often come from industry, commercializing initiatives from major labs or hyperscalers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the shift toward B2B rewards experience. B2B founders benefit from established relationships with potential team members, design partners &amp;amp; expertise selling to enterprises. These networks take years to build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, press coverage distorts perception. Media tends to spotlight younger founders pursuing product-led growth or consumer strategies. The Cursor team, fresh from MIT, captures the zeitgeist. But there are many founders who grow up within an industry &amp;amp; then go out to upend it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps venture capitalists should start funding reverse aging programs. If this trend holds, the typical founder will be a decade older in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a complete VR setup from scratch to let rats play DOOM. The system includes a motion-tracked treadmill ball, a panoramic headset, an input trigger, and a reward circuit. All hardware and software components are open sourced, including 3D-printable designs, circuit diagrams, firmware, and control software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first version (v1) was built in New York by Viktor, who trained rats to walk through a corridor in DOOM using a simpler rig. That version was featured on Vice and PC Gamer. After moving back home, the project was paused. Public interest reignited development, leading to v2, a more advanced and modular version built in collaboration with electrical engineer Sándor Makra. Akos Blaschek later assisted significantly in documenting the project for open-sourcing, aiming to enable others to replicate and build upon this work. Key metallic components were designed and sourced in collaboration with SZURWIN KFT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic ball setup&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rats trained to run forward&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimal sensors and mechanics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No panoramic screen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New ball driver mechanism for smoother movement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foldable AMOLED screen with 180° horizontal and 80° vertical FOV, Full HD resolution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgraded sensors for movement tracking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforced feeder system with mixing motor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modular 3D-printable components&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improved electronics reliability and safety&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We reached the point of rat habituation but didn’t start training. Our rats (Todd, Kojima, Gabe) aged out before full testing. The setup works, but behavioral validation is pending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware is a comprehensive VR rig designed for rodents. It consists of a motion-tracked sphere that captures the rat's movements, a custom-built trigger for in-game actions, a curved panoramic screen for visual immersion, and an automated reward system that dispenses sugar water to reinforce behavior. All these components are mounted on a modular aluminum frame, creating a complete, self-contained environment for the rat to interact with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headset wraps around the rat’s head with a foldable AMOLED screen. It maximizes immersion without obstructing whisker space. The screen supports Full HD resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headset frame also integrates several sensory components: two small air nozzles are positioned near the left and right whiskers, capable of delivering targeted air puffs on command (e.g., signaling wall collisions in-game). The frame provides a secure mounting point for the reward system's dispenser tube, placing it near the rat's mouth. Additionally, the design includes placeholders for miniature speakers near each ear, intended for future implementation of stereo audio cues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Headset&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locomotion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Movement is captured via a free-spinning ball under the rat. Rotary sensors track displacement and convert it into game motion. The ball can also be driven by motors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These motors are used during training to roll the ball and simulate movement paths before a reward. This guides the rat on where to go, helping form movement-action associations. Like the trigger, this allows for programmatic training sequences with minimal initial input from the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Stand/Ball&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigger Input&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shooting input is a custom-built hand-operated lever. Rats pull it with their paws to fire. The lever is held in place by small springs, encased in a 3D-printed housing. It includes a rotary encoder to detect motion and a stepper motor to actuate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The motor allows programmatic control—pulling the lever to demonstrate shooting. This enables training by pairing visual cues with mechanical motion, reinforcing the association before the rat initiates the action on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Trigger&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward System&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Positive in-game actions trigger a liquid reward: sugar water delivered through a precise dispensing mechanism. The system consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mixer: Continuously stirs the sugar solution to maintain even concentration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pump + Pressure Sensor: Keeps the line under constant pressure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solenoid Valve: Magnetic valve that opens to release exact 10 µL doses&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispenser: Positioned near the mouth for easy access&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This setup ensures accurate, repeatable reward delivery with minimal delay. The reward is synchronized with game events to reinforce desired behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current system assumes basic rat mobility and grooming behavior. Fine-tuning might be needed for rats of different sizes or temperaments. Trigger placement and reward tube flow may need calibration per subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup is controlled through a modular Python system. The main entry point is arena_scenario.py, which runs the full control loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motion capture: Reads movement from optical flow sensors mounted around the treadmill ball.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locomotion control: Drives the ball motors to guide the rat during training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigger input: Reads lever pulls, detects voluntary shooting actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward delivery: Dispenses precise 10 μL sugar water rewards via a controlled solenoid valve and maintains constant line pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DOOM integration: Interfaces with a modified ViZDoom environment for real-time closed-loop behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training logic: Enforces demonstrations and delivers rewards based on game state and rat behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software runs on a PC and communicates with a Raspberry Pi via TCP sockets. The Pi handles real-time sensor reading, ball actuation, and reward control; the PC processes the sensor data, runs the game, and sends high-level commands to the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All major components—movement tracking, ball driving, trigger detection, and reward control—can be operated manually or in closed-loop mode. All control parameters (e.g., motor speeds, reward volumes) are set in Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no in-built calibration suite. Users must validate sensor alignment and reward timing manually. Some microcontroller firmwares might require tuning based on hardware tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rats successfully learned to navigate the virtual environment and trigger the shooting mechanism. Habituation took approximately two weeks per rat. While advanced training wasn't completed due to time constraints, initial data showed promising engagement with the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full behavioral validation requires longer training periods. Cross-subject variability wasn't extensively studied. The impact of prolonged VR exposure on rat well-being needs further research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Now?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present, there are multiple cases in which authors are suing AI companies for scraping their works without payment or permission. While these legal battles have been going on, Amazon has quietly added a new AI feature to its Kindle iOS app—a feature that “lets you ask questions about the book you’re reading and receive spoiler-free answers,” according to an Amazon announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company says the feature, which is called Ask this Book, serves as “your expert reading assistant, instantly answering questions about plot details, character relationships, and thematic elements without disrupting your reading flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publishing industry resource Publishers Lunch noticed Ask this Book earlier this week, and asked Amazon about it. Amazon spokesperson Ale Iraheta told PubLunch, “The feature uses technology, including AI, to provide instant, spoiler-free answers to customers’ questions about what they’re reading. Ask this Book provides short answers based on factual information about the book which are accessible only to readers who have purchased or borrowed the book and are non-shareable and non-copyable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As PubLunch summed up: “In other words, speaking plainly, it’s an in-book chatbot.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon did not answer PubLunch’s questions about “what rights the company was relying upon to execute the new feature was not answered, nor did they elaborate on the technical details of the service and any protections involved (whether to prevent against hallucinations, or to protect the text from AI training).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps most alarmingly, the Amazon spokesperson said, “To ensure a consistent reading experience, the feature is always on, and there is no option for authors or publishers to opt titles out.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also sounds as though authors and publishers were, for the most part, not notified of this feature’s existence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon is already in the news this week for its flawed AI recaps of television shows. After a Fallout recap was “garbage filled with mistakes,” as io9 called it, the company paused the feature. A similar thing happened earlier this year with Amazon’s AI dubs for anime series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As PubLunch says of Ask this Book, “Many rightsholders and creators are likely not to want an in-book chatbot without their specific review and approval (or at all), and we expect that message will be getting delivered to publishers and Amazon loud and clear in the ensuing days. And many people would deem the outputs of generative AI analyzing a particular copyrighted work as the very embodiment of a derivative work (or simply a direct infringement).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask this Book is currently only available in the Kindle iOS app in the US, but Amazon says it “will come to Kindle devices and Android OS next year.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page provides supplementary material for a presentation given at the German OWASP Day 2025 (Presentation Slides).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Intro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the eInvoicing Directive (2014/55/EU), the European Union introduced “standardized” electronic invoices in XML format. Increasingly, institutions and businesses in EU member states will be required to support these electronic invoices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While machine-readable invoices are, in general, a good idea, there are various issues with the EU’s approach, including needless complexity, a lack of true standardization (multiple syntaxes and various sub-formats), and a tendency to use technologies with inherent security problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to a combination of unfortunate design decisions, implementing software for electronic invoices is likely to be affected by security flaws if no countermeasures are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;XML Insecurity and XXE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The XML format is known to have inherent security flaws, the most dangerous ones being XXE vulnerabilities (XML eXternal Entity injection).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XXE vulnerabilities often allow the exfiltration of files. While some XML implementations have implemented secure defaults or were never vulnerable to begin with (e.g., Python, libxml2, .NET, Expat), others remain insecure by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two notable examples of implementations with insecure defaults are the Java standard library and the Saxon library. Both are commonly used within the electronic invoicing ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The problem with XSLT 2.0&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XSLT is a document transformation language. Only XSLT version 1.0 is widely supported. For XSLT 2.0 and above, only one freely available implementation exists: Saxon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To check compliance with the EN16931 standards, the EU provides validation artifacts based on Schematron. Those validation artifacts require XSLT 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, anyone using these validation artifacts will likely use Saxon to implement invoice parsing. Saxon, as mentioned, is vulnerable to XXE by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite its poor implementation status and the fact that its primary implementation has insecure defaults, XSLT 2.0 (and its successor 3.0) is a W3C recommendation. I raised these concerns with the W3C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discussion about XSLT 2.0/3.0 at W3C (2025)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Statement from back-then libxslt maintainer that no XSLT 2.0 support is planned (2007)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Comment from 2005 that XSLT 2.0 “was likely to be just a single implementation language”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Security test suite&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A security test suite for electronic invoices is provided here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting the EN16931 standards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU requirements for electronic invoices are standardized by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) in a set of standards named EN16931. The first two parts are available free of charge. Subsequent parts cost money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accessing these standards is surprisingly difficult. A link on the EU web page to CEN is currently broken. CEN does not provide direct downloads of these documents and refers to national standardization organizations. Those often require account registrations even to access the free-of-charge parts of the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Estonian standardization organization (EVS) provides downloads of parts one and two without registration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the parts of EN16931 that are not available free of charge, prices at EVS are cheaper than those at most other national standardization organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;GNU Unifont is part of the GNU Project. This page contains the latest release of GNU Unifont, with glyphs for every printable code point in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). The BMP occupies the first 65,536 code points of the Unicode space, denoted as U+0000..U+FFFF. There is also growing coverage of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP), in the range U+010000..U+01FFFF, and of Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) with Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Commercial Use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A user has asked if GNU Unifont can be used with commercial (non-free) software. The answer is yes. The GNU Font Embedding Exception and the SIL OFL allow for that. See the next section for details. The main purpose of the licensing is to require derivative fonts that others create to be released to the public under the same licensing terms, not to prohibit the use of those fonts with certain software. Thus, preserving the license terms in derivative fonts provides a public benefit. The licenses also provide acknowledgement of previous Unifont contributors for their volunteer work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Copyright, Derivative Works, and License&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of Unifont glyphs are creations of individual Unifont contributors; those glyphs enjoy copyright protections of various degrees. Some of those contributions are letter forms of established alphabets while others are icon (symbol) designs such as the many animal icons which, as artistic designs, have even stronger international protections. See for example this memorandum of applicable laws of Berne Union member country Germany (where Unifont was created): Unifont Copyright Protections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Derivative variants of Unifont are permitted under the terms of the dual license: GNU GPLv2+ with the GNU Font Embedding Exception and the SIL Open Font License version 1.1. These are free licenses. The remainder of this section provides details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These font files are licensed under the GNU General Public License, either Version 2 or (at your option) a later version, with the exception that embedding the font in a document does not in itself constitute a violation of the GNU GPL. The full terms of the license are in LICENSE.txt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of Unifont version 13.0.04, the fonts are dual-licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1 and the GNU GPL 2+ with the GNU font embedding exception. The SIL OFL is available at OFL-1.1.txt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Font Downloads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard font build — with and without the ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) / Under-CSUR Private Use Area (PUA) glyphs. Download in your favorite format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; OpenType: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Standard Unifont OpenType Download: unifont-17.0.03.otf (5 Mbytes)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unifont Japanese OpenType Version: unifont_jp-17.0.03.otf (5 Mbytes)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Glyphs above the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane: unifont_upper-17.0.03.otf (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unicode ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) PUA Glyphs: unifont_csur-17.0.03.otf (0.5 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PCF: unifont-17.0.03.pcf.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; BDF: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;unifont-17.0.03.bdf.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unifont Japanese BDF Version: unifont_jp-17.0.03.bdf.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specialized versions — built by request:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PSF: A specialized PSF 1 console frame buffer font consisting of 512 glyphs for use with APL, A Programming Language, in console mode (single-user mode on GNU/Linux, etc.), mainly to support GNU APL: Unifont-APL8x16-17.0.03.psf.gz (4 kbytes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HEX: All the Plane 0 glyphs in Roman's .hex format, for those who wish to experiment: unifont-17.0.03.hex.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HEX: The above .hex file with combining circles added: unifont_sample-17.0.03.hex.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Windows or Mac OS X, unzip the .ttf.zip file or download the uncompressed .ttf file and copy the font to your Fonts folder. On Microsoft Windows, this folder is located under the Windows folder on your main disk. On a Mac, this is located under the Library folder on your main disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For best appearance on a Mac in a Terminal window, select Terminal from the menu, then Preferences. A Settings window will appear. Make sure that you're on the Text tab in that window. Then make sure that the "Antialias text" box is checked. The OpenType version of the font should then look fine at point sizes of 12pt and larger. The font won't look very legible in a Mac Terminal window unless you select this antialias option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: BDF, PCF, and OpenType files contain dimension and spacing information for each glyph in a font. Some font rendering engines ignore this glyph information that the font file provides. This is especially true of rendering engines designed to handle monospace fonts. Unifont will not display all glyphs correctly with such software. The BDF font follows BDF version 2.1 (not version 2.2) because the the X Window System standardized on version 2.1. The PSF 1 version of Unifont is a monospace font but is limited to 512 glyphs, and is only of use with font rendering engines that support more than 256 glyphs in a console frame buffer font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All unifont.hex sources are in the full Unifont Utilities download page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unifont Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifont only stores one glyph per printable Unicode code point. This means that complex scripts with special forms for letter combinations including consonant combinations and floating vowel marks such as with Indic scripts (Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, etc.) or letters that change shape depending upon their position in a word (Indic and Arabic scripts) will not render well in Unifont. In those cases, Unifont is only suitable as a font of last resort. Users wishing to properly render such complex scripts should use full OpenType fonts that faithfully display such alternate forms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drawing New Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute glyphs, please email unifoundry at gmail in advance (not spelled out because of spammers). Several contributors are working on new glyphs, and it would be unfortunate to have multiple persons drawing the same glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Special Note: New Plane 2 and Plane 3 CJK Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The People's Republic of China (PRC) has a set of 15-by-16 pixel Chinese glyphs for Unicode Plane 2 and Plane 3. However, those glyphs are copyrighted and licensed for sale by the Government of the PRC, and thus they cannot be used in a free font. If you happen to have any of those copyrighted 15-by-16 pixel glyphs, please do not send them for inclusion. Unifont includes many glyphs in this range, drawn by Chinese and Japanese volunteers. More are planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Release Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This latest release is part of the GNU Project. You can view the GNU Project Unifont Page on Savannah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the Unicode Plane 0 range is 65,536 code points minus the 2,048 surrogate pair code points, minus the 6,400 Private Use Area code points, minus the two noncharacters (U+FFFE and U+FFFF). This amounts to 57,086 assignable code points apart from the Private Use Area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the higher Unicode planes is 65,534; the last two code points in each plane are reserved as noncharacters.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; 12 September 2023 (Unifont 15.1.01) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;As mentioned during the year leading up to this release, TrueType fonts are no longer produced by the default build; OpenType fonts have taken their place. This change has been driven by the diminishing support for TrueType fonts in the Pango font rendering engine. TrueType fonts can still be built from the distribution tarball using the command "make truetype" in the font directory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ho-Seok Ee proposed a new Johab encoding for algorithmic Hangul Syllables generation. The resulting scheme uses 6 variations of initial consonants (choseong), 3 of medial vowels and diphthongs (jungseong), and 1 of final consonants (jongseong). The image on the left is partial output from a new supporting Unifont utility,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;unijohab2html&lt;/code&gt;, which gives an overview of how the three components of a Hangul syllable combine with each other and outputs any overlaps for a font designer's analysis. A full discussion of this new Johab 6/3/1 encoding appears on the Unifont Hangul Syllables Generation web page. Minseo Lee (ì´ë¯¼ì) provided feedback on the glyphs prior to their release.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Following a suggestion by Ho-Seok Ee, the &lt;code&gt;hangul-base.hex&lt;/code&gt;file that contains the Johab 6/3/1 glyphs for Hangul syllable formation now begins at code point U+E000. This allows building a Unifont variant with that entire Hangul johab glyph set in the Uniode Plane 0 Private Use Area (PUA) using the command "&lt;code&gt;make PUA=plane00/hangul/hangul-base.hex&lt;/code&gt;". in the font directory. Unifont builds have traditionally left the PUA available for CSUR/UCSUR glyphs, which is still the default; see below for a discussion of the CSUR/UCSUR glyphs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Johnnie Weaver modified "IJ" ligature glyphs U+0132 and U+0133. He also modified U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Paul Hardy: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified U+2CC2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER CROSSED SHEI and U+2CC3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER CROSSED SHEI for consistency with the redrawn U+03E2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER SHEI and U+03E3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER SHEI.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Redrew Ideographic Description Characters (U+2FF0..U+2FFB) for consistency and added new glyphs (U+2FFC..U+2FFF).

          &lt;p&gt;1PCF fonts can only include glyphs in Plane 0.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2Only a subset of Plane 2 and Plane 3 CJK glyphs plus the Plane 1 Copyleft glyph (U+1F12F) are included, to stay within the OpenType limit of 65,536 glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;

      font files.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 2 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The table below links to the Japanese glyphs in Plane 2 (Supplementary Ideographic Plane) contained in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
      Note: These Plane 2 glyphs along with the Plane 0 glyphs in 
      &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt; font files provide complete coverage of the JIS X 0213
      standard.  Only 303 glyphs appear in the files below.  Files with no glyphs appear
      with a gray background.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This next table links to the Chinese glyphs in Plane 2 (Supplementary Ideographic Plane) contained in &lt;code&gt;unifont&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
      Note: These Plane 2 glyphs along with the default Plane 0 glyphs
      in Unifont provide complete coverage of the Table of General Standard Chinese
      Characters (éç¨è§èæ±åè¡¨).  Only 232 glyphs appear in the files below.
      Files with no glyphs appear with a gray background.

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 3 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plane 3 begins with the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G block, from U+30000 through U+3134A. This includes the highly complex biang Chinese ideograph and taito Japanese ideograph:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 14 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This table links to the two ranges of 256 assigned code points in Plane 14 (Tags and Variation Selector Supplement) that appear in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_upper&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 0 and Plane 15 Private Use Area Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Finally, this last glyph table shows ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) and Under CSUR glyphs that appear in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_csur&lt;/code&gt; OpenType
      and TrueType font files.  Not all of the Plane 0 CSUR and UCSUR scripts
      have been drawn, but given the esoteric nature of some CSUR and UCSUR scripts
      (including the unavailability of glyph samples for many of the more obscure
      constructed scripts), the boxes in the table all have a green background color
      even if not at 100% coverage.

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Contributing Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute glyphs to the GNU Unifont effort, you can download the associated PNG file from the tables above (SMP and CSUR need additions). Then draw new glyphs in the 16-by-16 pixel area that is inside the inner box you see in the image on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When done, erase the surrounding inner box and ruler lines around the inner box. You can then save the file as a monochrome bitmap image. Then convert the .png file into a .hex file with the unipng2hex utility in the source tarball. Or you can just email the .png file to me as a contribution to this effort and I will do the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Why is the outer grid so much larger than the 16-by-16 pixel inner box?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A: Because in a future version, unipng2hex, unihex2png, and other utilities should be able to handle larger glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table below shows the current state of completion of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (Plane 1). Any range in the table that doesn't have a green background has missing glyphs. To see which scripts are in a particular range, consult the "Supplementary Multilingual Plane" list in the Current Coverage section below. The more red a range appears in the table below, the more glyphs are missing from that range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Current Coverage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Links in this section reference the first block of 256 glyphs where a script begins.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Note: Scripts such as Cuneiform, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, and Bamum Supplement will not be drawn on a 16-by-16 pixel grid. There are plans to draw these scripts on a 32-by-32 pixel grid in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plane 14 has two scripts, both of which Unifont covers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt; GNU Unifont Glyphs &lt;p&gt;Plane 14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Range&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Script&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;U+0E0000..U+0E007F&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tags&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;U+0E0100..U+0E01EF&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Variations Selectors Supplement&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list below shows the scripts that are in Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) and Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR that have coverage in this release of Unifont:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially I just posted my additions to Roman Czyborra's original unifont.hex file. Then in mid-January 2008, his website went down. So I started posting font updates here. Roman has encouraged me to continue with my additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roman's website is now back online, and you can read his Unifont description and motivation for its creation on his website, along with his archive of Unifont's changes: http://czyborra.com/unifont.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TrueType Font Generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis Alejandro González Miranda wrote a cool combination of scripts to convert GNU Unifont from .hex format into FontForge .sfd format, then to have FontForge convert this to a TrueType outline font (see the Unicode Utilities web page on this site for more information). Pixels are drawn as outlined squares, so they scale to all point sizes. This works well with GNOME; I haven't tried it with any other Unix windowing environment. I've removed the OpenType SBIT font link from this page because the outline font is much more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis has given me permission to modify his scripts to convert the latest GNU Unifont versions to TrueType. I've modified his original scripts to handle Unicode combining characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JIS X 0213 Kanji&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Jiskan16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Unifont 12.1.02 added Japanese BDF and TrueType versions, &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt;.  This replaced over 10,000 ideographs
    in the default Unifont font with Japanese kanji from the 16 × 16
    pixel Jiskan 16 font.  The font is available in two files,
    corresponding to the two planes in JIS X 0213.  Both files are
    in the public domain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comments in the BDF source font files (downloadable from the Japanese Fonts page) credit the following contributors (in order): Toshiyuki Imamura, HANATAKA Shinya, Taichi Kawabata, Koichi Yasuoka, TOYOSHIMA Masayuki, Kazuo Koike, and SATO Yasunao.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Unifont release, the glyphs from the two JIS X 0213 planes were converted into Unifont .hex files and mapped to code points in Unicode's Plane 0 and Plane 2 for Unifont. The result provides complete representation of the kanji in JIS X 0213 in a free Unicode font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Izumi16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifont 12.1.03 replaced the Jiskan16 glyphs with the public domain Izumi16 glyphs. These provide improvements on the earlier Jiskan16 glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wen Quan Yi: Spring of Letters (文泉驛 / 文泉驿)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Unifont CJK glyphs were replaced by new CJK glyphs from version 1.1 of Qianqian Fang's Unibit font. The Unibit font began as a combination of the original GNU Unifont glyphs and a basic CJK bitmap font placed in the public domain by the People's Republic of China. It adopted GNU Unifont's scheme of 8x16 and 16x16 glyphs. Qianqian Fang and many others then added about 10,000 more glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qianqian states in the Unibit distribution: "The entire CJK Unified Ideographics (U4E00-U9FA5) and CJK Unified Ideographics Extension A(U3400-U4DB5) blocks were replaced by high-quality glyphs from China National Standard GB19966-2005 (public domain)." Wen Quan Yi volunteeers then edited thousands of these characters. Qianqian also drew the new 22 CJK ideographs in the range U+9FA6..U+9FBB that appear in GNU Unifont.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wen Quan Yi (WQY) means "spring of letters," as in a spring of water. This is an interesting choice of words, as the British spelling of "font" is "fount" (but still pronounced "font"). See his website for more details: http://wqy.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/enindex.cgi, or in Chinese at http://wenq.org/wqy2/index.cgi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following code points in the latest unifont.hex file are taken from the WQY Unibit font (with my additions to complete the U+3000..U+33FF range, particularly the missing Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji), including glyphs updated by the Wen Quan Yi volunteers and other modifications as part of the Unifont font:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2E80..U+2EFF: CJK Radicals Supplement&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2F00..U+2FDF: Kangxi Radicals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2FF0..U+2FFF: Ideographic Description Characters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3000..U+303F: CJK Symbols and Punctuation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+31C0..U+31EF: CJK Strokes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3200..U+32FF: Enclosed CJK Letters and Months&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3300..U+33FF: CJK Compatibility&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3400..U+4DBF: CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+4E00..U+9FBF: CJK Unified Ideographs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+F900..U+FAFF: CJK Compatibility Ideographs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+FF00..U+FF60: Fullwidth Forms of Roman Letters&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qianqian has given his okay to add these CJK glyphs from the Wen Quan Yi project into GNU Unifont. Likewise, I've told him to incorporate any glyphs he wants from my contributions to GNU Unifont into his Unibit font. In October 2020, Qianqian Fang also granted permission to apply the SIL Open Font License version 1.1 to Wen Quan Yi glyphs in Unifont as a dual license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What's Next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the glyphs in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane that could easily be drawn in a 16-by-16 pixel grid have been drawn as of the Unifont 9.0.01 release. There are no plans to draw Tangut. A number of ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) scripts remain to be drawn. If you are interested in contributing glyphs to this effort, please contact me. All new contributions must be licensed under the same license as the rest of Unifont (in a nutshell, GPL 2+ with the GNU font embedding exception and the SIL OFL 1.1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the great work done by contributors in providing ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) glyphs, they are available in font files that have "_csur" in their name.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
