    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Going immutable on macOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;· 8 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With no surprise the end of one year marks the start of the next.&lt;lb/&gt; And the beginning of a year is always synonymous with… a fresh macOS system!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But managing a good working environment on macOS has long been a game of “hope for the best.” We’ve all been there: a &lt;code&gt;curl | sh&lt;/code&gt; here, a manual &lt;code&gt;brew install&lt;/code&gt; there, and six months later, you’re staring at a broken &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; and a Python environment that seems to have developed its own consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time recently moving my entire workflow into a declarative system using nix. From my zsh setup to my odin toolchain, here is why the transition from the imperative world of Homebrew to the immutable world of nix-darwin has been both a revelation and a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The problem to solve: imperative rot #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Homebrew is great.&lt;lb/&gt; From the Linux world, it was the perfect missing package manager for macOS at first, promoted by a lot of developers, and it (mostly) works. But Homebrew has a problem: it is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;code&gt;brew install&lt;/code&gt; you are changing the state of your machine in a way that is difficult to reverse or replicate exactly.&lt;lb/&gt; As an example, if I set up a new Mac today, &lt;code&gt;brew install neovim&lt;/code&gt; might give me version 0.10. However, if I do it six months from now, the version might changed and I had to reconfigure some components because of that change. The consequence is me, spending a few hours debugging my environment instead of writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A solution to that is postfix every brew package by its version, but this is not possible for every package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another solution is system immutability and the Nix store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;System immutablility, and the Nix store #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nix approaches the problem from a functional programming perspective.&lt;lb/&gt; Your system is not a collection of side effects, but a pure function of your configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows different strong points like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reproducibility: Every package lives in &lt;code&gt;/nix/store&lt;/code&gt;with a unique hash. This means I can have three different versions of the Odin compiler side-by-side, and they will never see each other, or even mess up with the different versions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;rollbacks: If a system update breaks my shell, I don’t panic. I just boot into a previous generation. The previous state of my system is still sitting in the store, untouched.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;flakes: Using &lt;code&gt;flake.lock&lt;/code&gt;, I pin my setup to specific git commits. If it works on my laptop then it will work on yours. Period.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rollbacks on macOS exist, and are great to go back to a previous version “that works”.&lt;lb/&gt; As an example, to list all my previous generations, I can do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; sudo nix-env --list-generations -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system
   1   2025-12-28 01:21:38
   2   2025-12-28 01:33:47
   3   2025-12-28 09:34:27
   4   2025-12-28 09:43:15
   5   2025-12-28 11:00:49
   6   2025-12-28 11:10:12
   7   2025-12-28 11:19:03
   ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each generation is also stored in a read-only specific volume on your system, which prevents accidental mutability of your packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On macOS &lt;code&gt;nix-darwin&lt;/code&gt; allows me to modify everything, from Finder settings to the Dock, or the Trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an example, this is a part of my setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;...
configuration = { pkgs, ... }: {
    # Firewall settings
    networking.applicationFirewall = {
        enable = true;
        enableStealthMode = true;
        allowSigned = true;
        allowSignedApp = true;
    };

    system.defaults = {
        CustomUserPreferences = {
          # Disable siri
          "com.apple.Siri" = {
            "UAProfileCheckingStatus" = 0;
            "siriEnabled" = 0;
          };
          # Disable personalized ads 
          "com.apple.AdLib" = {
            allowApplePersonalizedAdvertising = false;
          };
        };

        # Show battery percentage in the menu bar
        controlcenter.BatteryShowPercentage = true;

        # Allow touch to click
        trackpad.Clicking = true;

        # Hide the dock after a small delay of inactivity
        dock.autohide = true;
        dock.autohide-delay = 0.25;

        ...
    };
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And all those settings are documented in the official nix-darwin manual here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Nix flake #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before diving into the pros and cons of Nix, we need to address the engine under the hood: The Nix Flake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the traditional Nix world, things were a bit loose.&lt;lb/&gt; You had “channels”, but “channels” that could change behind your back… and we don’t want to get back to mutable systems.&lt;lb/&gt; Nix flakes fixed this by introducing a strictly defined structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every Flake has a &lt;code&gt;flake.nix&lt;/code&gt; (the blueprint) and a &lt;code&gt;flake.lock&lt;/code&gt; (the time capsule).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lockfile is actually the secret sauce.&lt;lb/&gt; It records the exact git commit of every dependency. When I build my system, I’m not just asking for “the latest version of the Odin programming language”, but for the exact version of Odin that existed at a specific moment in history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, when you run &lt;code&gt;darwin-rebuild switch --flake .&lt;/code&gt; to update your system (depending on configuration changes), Nix will look first at the lockfile.
If the lockfile says you are using &lt;code&gt;nixpkgs&lt;/code&gt; from October 12th at 10:45 PM, that is exactly what it fetches.
Nix doesn’t matter if you are on a new MacBook or an old iMac. If the lockfile is the same, then the resulting environment will be identical to your previous setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This turns system administration into a pure function: the same inputs always produce the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The “get and forget” workflow #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most liberating features is the “ephemeral shell” provided by Nix.&lt;lb/&gt; Imagine you need to test a script against &lt;code&gt;Python 3.15&lt;/code&gt;, but you don’t want to install a pre-release version globally and risk breaking your system tools…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Nix, you run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;nix shell nixpkgs#python314
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, &lt;code&gt;python --version&lt;/code&gt; returns 3.14.
You run your tests, you exit the shell, and it’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No leftovers, no site-packages conflicts, no trace. It is the ultimate “get and forget” utility, without messing up your system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However be careful as “ephemeral” does not mean “sandboxed” or “isolated” in this context! A common misconception is that &lt;code&gt;nix shell&lt;/code&gt; is like a Docker container or a VM, but it is not as &lt;code&gt;nix shell&lt;/code&gt; only isolated the environment variables, and is still running directly on the darwin kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt; The learning &lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;curve&lt;/del&gt; cliff # &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this configuration exempt from defaults? Absolutely not.&lt;lb/&gt; In fact, its biggest “default” is one of the most significant pain points in modern software: it arrives wrapped in complicated concepts and dense foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The learning curve for Nix is actually not a curve, but a vertical cliff face.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike Homebrew, where you just type a command and forget it, Nix requires you to learn a domain-specific language called… &lt;code&gt;Nix&lt;/code&gt; (I know, it is confusing). You have to understand how symbolic links work on macOS, how the Nix daemon interacts with Apple’s read-only system volume, and why your applications don’t magically appear in Spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, getting GUI apps to show up in the Applications folder requires “trampoline” binaries or custom activation scripts using &lt;code&gt;mkalias&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;lb/&gt; After a few minutes debugging and scrolling forums it works great, but many users will simply stop there and walking away with the mistaken impression that &lt;code&gt;nix-darwin&lt;/code&gt; is an immature project, rather than a deeply powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The documentation is great, but maybe not well arranged.&lt;lb/&gt; As an example, this is the manual to write your own &lt;code&gt;flake.nix&lt;/code&gt;: https://nix-darwin.github.io/nix-darwin/manual/.
You can be lost very easily in the manual if you do not know what you are looking for…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The hybrid reality #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite my love for Nix, it isn’t perfect for everything. macOS GUI applications like Thunderbird, Firefox, or CrossOver, often fight against the read-only nature of the Nix store.&lt;lb/&gt; Those software expect to self-update and live in &lt;code&gt;/Applications&lt;/code&gt; on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found the sane path to be an hybrid approach: I use &lt;code&gt;nix-darwin&lt;/code&gt; to manage my critical state (compilers, LSPs, shell aliases), and use the homebrew module inside my Nix config to handle the big GUI pieces. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// file: brew.nix
homebrew = {
  enable = true;
  casks = [ 
    "firefox" 
    "thunderbird" 
    "crossover" 
  ];
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it! And using this, I am sure Nix will use &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; to install those software on my system, as I did manually with my &lt;code&gt;brew install&lt;/code&gt; scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives me the best of both worlds: Homebrew handles the macOS-specific integration, but Nix still “records” that they should exist in my declarative blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to start #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to move away from “hope-based” configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;install the Determinate Nix Installer: it handles the messy macOS multi-user setup for you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;initialize a Flake and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;home-manager&lt;/code&gt;: Create a&lt;code&gt;flake.nix&lt;/code&gt;and a&lt;code&gt;home.nix&lt;/code&gt;for your home-manager instance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;think “modularity”, like keeping your system settings in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;system.nix&lt;/code&gt;, your dev tools in&lt;code&gt;dev.nix&lt;/code&gt;, and your GUI apps in&lt;code&gt;brew.nix&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;version everything and commit your&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;flake.lock&lt;/code&gt;! It is the source of truth for your system.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are curious I’ve documented my current setup, including my security hardening (firewall, stealth mode, etc.) here: k0pernicus/dotfiles/nix-darwin-config.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind this configuration is personal, and might not be interesting (and certainly not useful) for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few links that helped me to make a first setup version for my mac:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;https://github.com/torgeir/nix-darwin&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s more work upfront, certainly. But there is a profound peace of mind in knowing that your system is defined by code, not by a history of forgotten terminal commands.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two people. Eighteen accounts spanning checking, savings, credit cards, investments. Three currencies. Twenty minutes of work every week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One net worth number I actually trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The payoff: A single, trustworthy net worth number growing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No app did exactly what I needed, so I built my own personal finance system using plain-text accounting principles and a powerful Python library called Beancount. This post shows you how I handle imports, investments, multi-currency, and a two-person view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How I got here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It all started during the 2021 tax season. I had blocked out an entire weekend and was juggling statements, trying to compute capital gains, stressing about getting the numbers mixed up. “This is chaos”, I thought. “There must be a way to simplify this with automation”. Being a software engineer, I did what felt natural and hacked together a bunch of scripts on top of a database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though it worked and I kept using it day-to-day, by the next tax season the cracks became obvious. The code was hard to debug, random transactions went missing, and worst of all, the balances the scripts computed didn’t match the balances on my statements. I tried to fix it but the more I tried, the more I felt lost about what the system was really doing. Eventually I just gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did I fail so spectacularly? My entire approach was flawed from the start! I’d ignored centuries of accounting wisdom and repeated fundamental mistakes humanity solved long ago. So I learned from my mistakes and did the research. And over time I incrementally discovered double-entry bookkeeping, plain-text accounting and Beancount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and I have a flexible, powerful, and private system, fully customized to how my brain works. Most transactions import automatically from PDF statements (counterintuitively, it’s often more reliable than CSV!). Tax time is a simple matter of checking always-fresh reports and copying numbers over. The weekly ritual is simple: download statements, categorize transactions in a web UI, run a bunch of scripts to regenerate, commit (I walk through this in more detail later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I want to be realistic: building a system like this takes time and effort.1 You will need to learn some basic accounting concepts, be comfortable with Python, and consistently spend time every week keeping things up-to-date. If your finances are simple or you just want day-to-day budgeting, this is almost certainly overkill. Apps like YNAB or even the humble spreadsheet work great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you want uncompromising control over how you look at your finances, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 1: The Concepts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Double-entry bookkeeping&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose on a Saturday, I transfer money from my checking account to a savings account. The money leaves on the same day but doesn’t show up on the other side until Monday. So where was it for those two days?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a “normal”2 personal finance system, the answer would be that it was just gone. That is, for those two days, there would be a drop in the total money in two accounts. But this is weird because in reality my “net worth” did not change, yet there’s no good way to represent this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or suppose I pay $90 for a dinner for me and two friends. They pay me back a week later. Again, in this case the money is “gone” for that week. And even worse, the full $90 would be categorized as a “restaurant expense” while each $30 my friends paid would be “income”. But this is wrong. My expense is just $30 and the money they give me should be matched against the $60 they owe me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of these are fundamental problems with how so-called “single-entry bookkeeping” works: each account’s transactions and balance are tracked individually but without the context of the “whole”. In the case of the transfer, because we’re looking at each account in isolation, we lose the fact that even though the money has left one account, it’s really still part of the “pool of money” that belongs to us. Similarly, when our friends pay us back, we’re not tracking the fact that our friends owe us money when the original transaction happened and their payment later neutralizes the debt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double-entry bookkeeping is the solution to both these problems. Businesses have been using it for hundreds of years3 to run their accounts, and it has powerful yet elegant ways to solve these problems and many others too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider again the transfer. In double-entry bookkeeping, we would represent the initial move of money as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Bank-Checking              -1000
Transfer-In-Flight         +1000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when it arrives:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Transfer-In-Flight         -1000
Savings-Account            +1000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In both cases, we see the “golden rules” of double-entry bookkeeping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every transaction has at least two sides and the sum of all the sides is zero. -1000 + 1000 = 0. That is, transactions always “balance”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every side of a transaction is an account, whether it exists in the real world or not.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be clear that “Bank-Checking” and “Savings-Account” are labels for your checking and savings accounts, respectively. But what is “Transfer-In-Flight”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, it’s also an account! It’s not an account you’ll find on your bank’s website, but within the double-entry system, it’s just as real. Concretely, accounts in double-entry are just labels for a “bucket of money”. So there’s no “category to put this transaction under”, no “expense tracking”, no special “transfer tag”. Everything is an account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this specific case, &lt;code&gt;Bank-Checking&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Savings-Account&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Transfer-In-Flight&lt;/code&gt; are all a specific type of account: they are Asset accounts. Assets are stuff you own; these can be real accounts (bank account, savings, stocks, bonds) or conceptual accounts (money in transit between accounts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s consider the dinner example. There are 4 sides to the transaction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Credit-Card                  -90
Restaurant-Expense           +30
Owes-Me:Alice                +30
Owes-Me:Bob                  +30
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, -90 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 0. It balances. All of &lt;code&gt;Credit-Card&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Restaurant-Expense&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Owes-Me:Alice&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Owes-Me:Bob&lt;/code&gt; are just accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Credit-Card&lt;/code&gt; is a different type of account though: it’s a Liability. Liabilities are the opposite of assets: instead of stuff you own, they’re stuff you owe to someone else. So for example, loans, credit cards, and mortgages are all liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why negative 90? The rule is always: negative means money flowed from this account and positive means it flowed into this account. The credit card company fronted you $90, so that money flowed from your credit card to fund the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Restaurant-Expense&lt;/code&gt; is yet another type of account, an Expense account. Expense accounts are money “leaving your world”. So any time you spend some money and you no longer have access to it, that’s an expense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;code&gt;Owes-Me:Alice&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Owes-Me:Bob&lt;/code&gt; are also Assets. Alice and Bob have promised to pay you back, and that promise has value, $30 each. It’s not cash in your pocket, but it’s money you have a claim on. In double-entry, anything with economic value you control is an asset, whether it’s a bank balance or an IOU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, when Alice pays you back:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Bank-Checking               +30
Owes-Me:Alice               -30
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just money moving from the “virtual” &lt;code&gt;Owes-Me:Alice&lt;/code&gt; to the “real” &lt;code&gt;Bank-Checking&lt;/code&gt; account. Both of these are still assets; it’s just the type of asset that’s changing. So no money has “entered the system” at this point. You’re just settling the debt Alice owed you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take one last example: a paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Bank-Checking              +3000
Salary                     -3000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bank-Checking&lt;/code&gt; is an Asset as we’ve learned. But &lt;code&gt;Salary&lt;/code&gt; is a new account type, an Income account. Just like Assets and Liabilities are opposites, so are Income and Expenses. Where Expenses are money leaving your world, Income is money entering it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Money flowed from Salary (source, negative) to Bank-Checking (destination, positive). The sign feels backwards: “I received money, so why is Income negative?” Because the sign shows direction of flow: income is where the money came from, and your bank is where it went to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the one part of double-entry that takes repetition.4 Don’t try to make it intuitive; just trust the invariant: if your transaction sums to zero, you’ve got the signs right. After a dozen transactions, the pattern becomes automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These four types of accounts cover 99% of what you’ll do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assets: stuff you own (bank accounts, cash, investments, money owed to you)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Liabilities: stuff you owe (credit cards, loans)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Income: money entering your world (salary, interest, dividends)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expenses: money leaving your world (groceries, rent, restaurants)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a fifth type, Equity, which is a catch-all “this money doesn’t fit elsewhere” bucket.5 Suppose you start tracking an account that already has $1000 in it; that money came from somewhere but you don’t have a record of that. It can’t be income because you already had it, and the other types don’t fit. That’s a good sign it belongs in equity. The good news is that you rarely interact with Equity directly. Generally, the software handles it for you, but there are some exceptions that we’ll cover in Chapter 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s so much more that could be said about double-entry bookkeeping. For further reading, I particularly like the double entry explainer in the Beancount docs. It goes through some more examples and expands into a bunch of related topics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we now have the foundation which ensures that every transaction balances, every dollar is accounted for, and nothing slips through the cracks. But we still need a way to actually record and store these transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plain text accounting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the things I learned from writing my own finance system is that auditability is king. You need the ability to eyeball a transaction, ask yourself “does this look right,” and fix it if it doesn’t. And nothing beats being able to see and edit any transaction you’ve ever made in a text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s one of the main things that drew me to the philosophy of Plain Text Accounting. This is a set of principles on using plain text files as the “immutable source of truth” of your finances and then building scripts and tools on top of them to process, analyze, and visualize them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many other advantages to this I’ve come to appreciate over the years:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything is version controlled. You can store these transaction files in a git repo, which has powerful effects. You can look at diffs to see what changed on any day. You can &lt;code&gt;git blame&lt;/code&gt; any transaction to see when and why it was added. You can &lt;code&gt;git tag&lt;/code&gt; important states of the repo (e.g. when taxes were filed, when a new job was started, when a big refactoring happened). You can &lt;code&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt; any previous state to see e.g. “how did my repo look last year”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s private so you never have to trust any third party with all your financial details. Everything can be stored in locations that you fully control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no lock-in. Because everything is just a plain text file, it’s trivially easy to change how you want things to be represented: you don’t have to deal with apps with broken or messy CSV exports making it difficult to take your data elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s scriptable. If you want to refactor something, compute a new breakdown or even rewrite your system entirely, all you need is to write a script. Whether you write it yourself or prompt an LLM to do it for you, the text-based format makes automation trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plain text gives you the abstract idea of “storing transactions in text” but there’s still a bunch of questions. What’s the transaction syntax? How do you parse your files? How do you validate that everything balances, compute totals, and let you query the results? That’s where Beancount comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Introducing Beancount!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, people have written many plain-text accounting tools which answer all the questions above. The main ones you’ll find which have gained a lot of popularity are Ledger, hledger, and Beancount. I’ve used each of them at some point in my plain text journey and all are solid choices. But I ended up on Beancount for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a Python library, not just a command-line tool. I can write importers that parse my bank’s PDF statements, generate transactions programmatically, and build custom reports, all in a language I already know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strictness by default. Accounts must be declared before use, so typos get caught immediately. Transactions must balance and there are immediate error messages if they don’t. The tool catches mistakes early rather than letting them propagate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plugin and tool ecosystem. Beancount has a very rich set of libraries and tools which build on top of and integrate with it. Along with the core project, you get access to any and all of these projects you want to use. We’ll discuss this much more later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fava. The web UI which sits on top of the Beancount engine. It’s so good that people convert from other formats (using tools like ledger2beancount or gnucash2beancount) just to use it. Where Beancount gives you the reliable engine, Fava gives you the pretty yet powerful frontend:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reports: balance sheet, income statement, transaction journal&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Query editor: SQL-like queries, exportable to CSV&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Charts: spending breakdowns, net worth over time, holdings by currency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Error highlighting: problems highlighted immediately&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extensibility: plugins like fava-dashboards and fava-portfolio-returns&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this, we now understand enough of the basic concepts for us to get started trying out Beancount!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 2: Getting Started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best way to learn plain-text accounting is to roll up your sleeves and try it out. So let’s pause the theory for a moment and get a real ledger running on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve built a companion repository, LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples, which contains a cut-down version of the system I use day-to-day. The repo is organized into folders that match the chapters of this post (&lt;code&gt;chapter-2/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;chapter-3/&lt;/code&gt;, etc.), each building on the previous. It also includes a &lt;code&gt;demo/&lt;/code&gt; folder with 2+ years of synthetic history if you want to see the end result immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get started, clone the repository:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/LalitMaganti/beancount-blog-examples.git
cd beancount-blog-examples

# Run the demo to see the end result
./scripts/quickstart.sh demo

# Or start Chapter 2 to follow the guide
./scripts/quickstart.sh chapter-2
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will set up a Python environment, install dependencies, and open Fava at http://localhost:5000. Here’s what you should see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fava's Trial Balance view shows assets, income, and expenses in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sunburst charts make it easy to spot your biggest expense categories instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click around the different tabs. You’ll find that Fava gives you the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Balance sheet: the state of your accounts at the current point in time. Basically think of it as an aggregate view of all your finances. You can answer questions like “what’s my net worth now?”, “how much money do I owe across my credit cards?” or “how much have I gained from investments?”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Income statement: the sum of all the money flows into/out of your accounts. Think of it as a sum of all the income and expenses across time. You can answer questions like “how much did I earn from my job?”, “how much did I spend on Amazon?” or “did I spend more or less than last year?”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transaction history: a flat list of all transactions you have in your journal. A way to see and search any transaction you’ve made across any accounts in your system.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Query Console lets you run SQL-like queries against your financial data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s much more to Fava’s features (queries, multi-currency, plugins) as we’ll see later on in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also explore the text journal itself using a text editor. For example, here’s a grocery run and a payslip in the Beancount transaction format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-2/src/transactions.beancount

; Beancount auto-fills the second amount when it can be inferred.
2024-01-15 * "Tesco" "Weekly groceries"
  Expenses:Groceries                    85.50 GBP
  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP

2024-01-25 * "Google" "January salary"
  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP    3200.00 GBP
  Income:Lalit:UK:Google:Salary
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go through the transactions and get a feel for the format. It might seem alien at first but trust me when I say soon it’ll feel like the most natural thing in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a VS Code extension, you get syntax highlighting and auto-completion for your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that you have a working system, I want to share the hard-won insights that aren’t in the official docs. This post isn’t going to be a full Beancount tutorial. The official docs are excellent for that (Fava even has a demo that you can try without downloading anything!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I want to focus on the architecture: the decisions I wish I’d made correctly from day one. I’m writing this as if I’m speaking to my past self.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Start with one account&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need to track everything on day one. Pick one account. Your main checking account is a good start. Get comfortable with the flow. Import statements, categorize transactions, check that balances match. Once that feels solid, add another account. Then another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started with my HSBC current account. Now, I have my whole financial life inside the system and I trust it wholeheartedly. But this happened one account at a time. If I tried to do everything in one go, I would certainly have been overwhelmed and given up on the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Opening balances&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve picked your first account, you face an immediate problem: you may have opened that account years ago and there might already be thousands of transactions over that time. Trying to import them all in one go is another sure path to being overwhelmed and giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, a better idea is to pick a “starting date” at which you say “I will import everything from this day onwards”. But that poses its own problem: you already had money in that account, how do you tell Beancount it exists?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, Beancount has a &lt;code&gt;pad&lt;/code&gt; directive that creates the balancing entry automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-2/src/balance.beancount
2024-01-01 open Equity:Opening-Balances
2024-01-01 pad Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP Equity:Opening-Balances
2024-01-02 balance Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP  1500.00 GBP
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pad&lt;/code&gt; directive tells Beancount: “whatever amount is needed to make the balance assertion true, take it from &lt;code&gt;Equity:Opening-Balances&lt;/code&gt; and put it in this account”. This is one of the rare cases you actually have to think about equity accounts (though not much beyond blindly using &lt;code&gt;Equity:Opening-Balances&lt;/code&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Structure That Scales&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding a first account is easy and the second is straightforward, but adding a third, fourth, fifth… and you can easily find that things start becoming jumbled and messy. Just like code, putting a little bit of thought into the organization upfront goes a long way. This part covers the architectural decisions you’ll thank yourself later for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Naming Asset and Liability accounts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure of asset and liability account names is very important, much more than I initially gave them credit for. It’s a good idea to keep as much information in them as possible. Here’s what I’ve settled on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-2/src/accounts.beancount
2024-01-01 open Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP          GBP
2024-01-01 open Assets:Lalit:UK:Barclays:Current:GBP      GBP
2024-01-01 open Liabilities:Lalit:UK:AMEX:GBP             GBP
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Type:Person:Region:Institution:Account:Currency
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this structure? Because it’s a lot easier to remove detail than add it in later! I initially started by not having the country, the currency or my name in the account. But over time, I wanted to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How much money I have in the UK vs the US?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How much cash (i.e. not investments) is in a certain currency?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How much of our household wealth was in my wife’s accounts vs my own (discussed in more detail in Chapter 6)?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having this information in the account name is great because Beancount’s SQL syntax makes it very easy to filter on account names. Want “all UK assets”? Filter on &lt;code&gt;:UK:&lt;/code&gt;. Want “all HSBC accounts”? Filter on &lt;code&gt;:HSBC:&lt;/code&gt;. Want “all GBP cash”? Filter on &lt;code&gt;:GBP&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Powering up with Plugins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have a structure, you want to ensure it stays clean. This is where Beancount’s Plugins come in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plugins are Python scripts that run when your ledger loads. They can validate data, modify entries, or even generate new transactions automatically. You load them in your journal file like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;plugin "beancount.plugins.check_commodity"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember the transfer-in-flight pattern from Chapter 1? Here’s how it looks in Beancount:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-2/src/transactions.beancount
; Money leaves on Saturday
2024-03-16 * "Transfer to Barclays"
  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP      -1000.00 GBP
  Assets:Lalit:Transfers:Internal        1000.00 GBP

; Money arrives on Monday
2024-03-18 * "Transfer from HSBC"
  Assets:Lalit:Transfers:Internal       -1000.00 GBP
  Assets:Lalit:UK:Barclays:Current:GBP   1000.00 GBP
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once both transactions are recorded, the transit account balance returns to zero, confirming the transfer is complete. If you record one leg of a transfer but forget the other, the transit account will simply show a non-zero balance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding where a non-zero balance in transfers is coming from is handled by my absolute favorite plugin, beancount_reds_plugins.zerosum. It’s responsible for matching both sides of a transaction and moving it to a separate account, meaning my &lt;code&gt;Transfers:Internal&lt;/code&gt; account only contains the actual “pending” transactions. Making this account empty is a surprisingly satisfying little “minigame” during my weekly imports (though it never lasts for long!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also a couple more plugins that make handling closed accounts better:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;beancount.plugins.close_tree - When you close an account, automatically closes all child accounts too. Useful as you move your banking between institutions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;beancount_checkclosed.check_closed - Validates that closed accounts have zero balance and no transactions after the close date.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The boundary of your system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you add accounts one by one, you’ll inevitably see money flowing to places you haven’t set up yet. Say you transfer £500 to a Natwest savings account you haven’t added to the system. Where does it go?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, use a named placeholder account in &lt;code&gt;Equity:Transfers&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-2/src/transactions.beancount
2024-03-15 * "Transfer to savings (not yet tracked)"
  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP     -500.00 GBP
  Equity:Transfers:Natwest-Savings      500.00 GBP
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This essentially says: “£500 went to Natwest Savings, which I’m not tracking yet”. Putting it in an equity account means it doesn’t pollute your balance sheet with incomplete information or your income statement with false expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note also the best practice of using a named equity account per untracked destination, not a generic bucket; this was a mistake I made when I did this initially. You’ll thank yourself when you import your Natwest savings account later, you can just do a search-replace to rename the accounts 6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Organizing your repo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you add these patterns (transit accounts, multiple institutions, liability accounts) your single &lt;code&gt;journal.beancount&lt;/code&gt; file will start to become unwieldy. Just like good software architecture, you want to organize upfront to be easy to maintain as the system continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what the structure looks like with the concepts we have right now (it’ll get more complicated as we go deeper!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chapter-2/
├── journal.beancount            # Main entry point, includes everything
├── src/
│   ├── accounts.beancount       # Account definitions
│   ├── transactions.beancount   # Primary transaction ledger
│   └── balance.beancount        # Balance assertions
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt;is what you write and edit (your “code”)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;journal.beancount&lt;/code&gt;is the entry point that includes everything&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Later, &lt;code&gt;data/&lt;/code&gt;will hold inputs from the outside world (raw statements: PDFs, OFX, CSVs)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This organization is a small change but can make a big difference in your subconscious feeling about the state of your finances!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Exit ramp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, you have a solid foundation for tracking multiple accounts. If you stop here, you have a robust, auditable system for manual bookkeeping. You could continue adding transactions by hand indefinitely, and you’d still be miles ahead of any spreadsheet in terms of correctness and visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But manual entry is a chore, and as your financial life grows, it becomes a bottleneck. In the next chapter, we’ll see how to automate the tedious part: getting transactions from your bank statements into your ledger without losing the control that plain-text accounting gives you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 3: Automated Import&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Automation is king, but harder than it looks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inputting transactions by hand works for some people, but I don’t have the patience for it. Ever since I was young, I’ve always wanted to automate everything: it’s the reason why I became a software engineer in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But full automation is a dead end. Most banks don’t offer APIs, and scraping breaks constantly. 2FA flows change 7, websites get redesigned, sessions expire. I tried this route, and it wasn’t worth it. Even in the US where aggregators like Plaid exist, coverage is patchy.8 In the UK, it’s impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The hierarchy of data sources&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what actually works? Well ideally your financial institution gives you something you can write a script against. But what that might be is non-obvious and counter-intuitive. Here’s the hierarchy I’ve landed on over time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OFX is the gold standard. If your bank offers it, use it. The format is standardized, transactions have unique IDs, and deduplication is straightforward. Life is easy if you have good OFX.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CSV is the deceptive runner-up. It seems like the logical choice. Structured data, right? But in practice, bank CSVs are often afterthoughts. I’ve seen column formats change without notice, “CSVs” that are actually weird custom formats spread over multiple lines, and rows coalesced in ways that lose critical information (like cost basis).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what do you do when OFX isn’t available and CSV isn’t trustworthy? You turn to an unlikely hero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why PDFs beat CSVs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It sounds backwards, but PDFs are often the most reliable data source available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banks have a strong incentive to get PDFs right. Customers actually read them. They’re legal documents that get printed and filed. If a bank messes up a PDF statement, they hear about it immediately. If they break a CSV export, it might go months without anyone noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key insight is that bank statement PDFs are almost always columnar. Of course, this relies on the PDF having a proper text layer; if your bank sends you scanned images, you’re out of luck (though I’ve yet to encounter one that does). When you convert them to text while preserving the layout, you get something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Date      Details                      Paid out     Paid in     Balance
15 Jan 24 TESCO STORES 1234            42.50                    1,457.50
16 Jan 24 TFL TRAVEL                    6.80                    1,450.70
25 Jan 24 GOOGLE SALARY                           3,200.00      4,650.70
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The columns are aligned by spaces, which means you can parse them as fixed-width data. The approach works in three steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convert PDF to text: Run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdftotext -layout statement.pdf statement.txt&lt;/code&gt;. The&lt;code&gt;-layout&lt;/code&gt;flag preserves the original column alignment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Find the table boundaries: Bank statements have predictable markers. HSBC uses “BALANCE BROUGHT FORWARD” at the start and “BALANCE CARRIED FORWARD” at the end. You extract just the transaction rows between these markers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parse with fixed-width columns: Pandas’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;read_fwf&lt;/code&gt;function is designed exactly for this. You put this logic inside the&lt;code&gt;extract()&lt;/code&gt;method of your&lt;code&gt;beangulp&lt;/code&gt;importer class, where it converts the text into a DataFrame:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Inside your Importer class
df = pd.read_fwf(
    io.StringIO(text),
    colspecs=[(0, 10), (10, 40), (40, 52), (52, 64), (64, 80)],
    names=['Date', 'Details', 'Paid out', 'Paid in', 'Balance']
)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The column positions come from inspecting the header row. In practice, I detect them dynamically by finding keywords like “Paid out” and “Paid in” in the header and using their character positions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have a DataFrame, generating Beancount transactions is straightforward. You write a small class that iterates through this DataFrame and maps each row to a Beancount &lt;code&gt;Transaction&lt;/code&gt; object, filling in the date, amount, and payee. See my HSBC importer for a working example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 95% of my banks, this approach works great. However, there is one bank where the text spacing becomes very strange and so I need to use something else. That’s when I turn to Tabula, a Java CLI that extracts data tables from PDFs, even very complex ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main reason I don’t use it all the time is that it’s much slower. But it also succeeds in the cases where &lt;code&gt;pdftotext&lt;/code&gt; fails. I run it to get a structured JSON output, from which I create transactions (see my HSBC US credit card importer).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure some readers will have worries about the fragility of what I’ve described here. I can tell you from experience that in three years, neither my UK nor my US HSBC PDF importer has ever broken. Neither has my Schwab one, and my Aviva one has only needed a single change. So I can personally vouch that this approach works and works well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;From raw data to transactions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, so now you have statements. What do you do then? There are two pieces to the puzzle: parsing statements into transactions, and categorizing those transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For parsing, Beancount has an official importer framework called beangulp. You write a Python class that knows how to read a particular file format (the skeleton importer in &lt;code&gt;chapter-3/&lt;/code&gt; already uses this API). Beangulp handles the mechanics: identifying which importer handles which file, extracting transactions, and deduplicating against existing entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But beangulp just extracts transactions without making any judgment on which account the transaction should be booked against. It doesn’t know that Tesco is groceries or that British Airways is an airline. I go to a new restaurant. How does the system know that is a restaurant?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads to a very important conclusion: we cannot fully automate importing transactions for bank accounts and credit cards. However, that doesn’t mean we have to enter things manually either. There’s a middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter beancount-import9 (Note: this is a standalone tool, distinct from Fava’s built-in import features). It’s a web UI that uses your beangulp importers and adds a categorization layer on top. You run it, it opens in your browser, and it presents pending transactions one by one for review. Think of it as a staging area where you approve or tweak before anything hits your ledger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each transaction, it shows the raw data from your statement alongside a suggested categorization. You can accept the suggestion, override it with a different account, or skip it entirely. Once you decide, it moves to the next one. The interface is simple, mostly keyboard-driven and optimized for speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The import UI allows you to manually categorize transactions, like this Tesco grocery run, while the system learns your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The categorization uses machine learning (old-school decision trees, running locally, no LLMs, no cloud). It learns from your previous choices: the first time you see “Tesco”, you pick “Expenses:Groceries”, and the second time it auto-suggests and you just hit Enter. After a few weeks, the system should know 90% of the types of transactions you make and it’s easy to correct the ones which it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’re proficient, a month’s worth of transactions takes 5-10 minutes. Most are repeats and you’re just hitting Enter. You only pause on genuinely new merchants. This is the core of my weekly ritual, and why I’ve found categorization has not become a chore, even after doing it for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Exit ramp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With automated imports and semi-automated categorization, the “hard work” of bookkeeping is mostly solved. For many, this is the endgame: a perfect record of where every penny went, updated in minutes each week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But your net worth isn’t just cash in a bank account. It’s also the stocks, bonds, and funds that grow (or shrink) over time. Tracking these requires a few more tools to handle cost basis, dividends, and market prices. We’ll tackle those in Chapter 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 4: Investments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now for investments. It’s where things get more interesting, and I think there’s less material out there covering the nitty-gritty. Here are some lessons I’ve learned over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Unified Mental Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important thing to realize is that Beancount treats everything as a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A share of Apple (&lt;code&gt;AAPL&lt;/code&gt;) is a commodity. A US Dollar (&lt;code&gt;USD&lt;/code&gt;) is a commodity. A British Pound (&lt;code&gt;GBP&lt;/code&gt;) is a commodity. While Beancount can infer these on the fly, you’ll typically declare them explicitly in your journal (e.g., &lt;code&gt;2024-01-01 commodity AAPL&lt;/code&gt;).10&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This explicit declaration is a small but critical architectural win: it prevents a simple typo from creating a phantom currency, and it provides the metadata that advanced reporting plugins (like those used to calculate your portfolio performance) rely on to work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means you don’t “buy stocks with money”. You simply exchange one commodity for another. The syntax for buying shares is identical to the syntax for exchanging currency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Account Structure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just like with bank accounts, I break investments down by institution and security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-4/src/accounts.beancount
2024-01-01 open Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:USD          USD
2024-01-01 open Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL         AAPL
2024-01-01 open Assets:Lalit:UK:Vanguard:ISA:GBP          GBP
2024-01-01 open Assets:Lalit:UK:Vanguard:ISA:VWRL         VWRL
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cash in a brokerage is just another holding named by currency (&lt;code&gt;GBP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;USD&lt;/code&gt;), while stock holdings use their ticker (&lt;code&gt;AAPL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VWRL&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you also need to track the flows generated by these assets: capital gains, dividends, commissions, and withholding taxes. I create specific accounts for each security:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2024-01-01 open Income:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL:Dividends        USD
2024-01-01 open Income:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL:Capital-Gains    USD
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why so granular? It’s the same reason I name assets fully: aggregation up the tree is trivial; disaggregation after the fact is impossible. If you track all your dividends in a single &lt;code&gt;Income:Dividends&lt;/code&gt; account, it’s easy to know “how much dividends did I earn total?”. But if you want to know “what was my AAPL dividend yield this year?”, you’re out of luck. Track at the leaf (&lt;code&gt;Income:IB:AAPL:Dividends&lt;/code&gt;), and you can answer both questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Notation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our accounts defined, we can now record the actual movement of assets. We use &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; to denote cost (what we paid per unit) and &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; to denote price (what the unit is worth now).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 1: Buying Stock Exchanging 1850 USD for 10 shares of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2024-01-10 * "BUY AAPL"
  Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL      10 AAPL {185.00 USD} @ 185.00 USD
  Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:USD   -1850.00 USD
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;{185.00 USD}&lt;/code&gt; is the cost basis and the &lt;code&gt;@ 185.00 USD&lt;/code&gt; is the price. Beancount uses the cost basis to track lots and calculate capital gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Cost basis rules depend heavily on where you are. In the US, you track cost basis of individual lots. In the UK, we have special “Section 104” pooling rules.11 I discuss this more in Chapter 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 2: Buying Currency Exchanging 950 GBP for 98,000 INR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2024-03-02 * "Wise" "GBP to INR"
  Assets:Lalit:UK:Wise:INR            98000.00 INR @@ 950.00 GBP
  Assets:Lalit:UK:Wise:GBP             -950.00 GBP
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the second example, &lt;code&gt;@@&lt;/code&gt; specifies the total cost rather than the per-unit cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 3: Selling Stock Selling 5 shares of Apple at $190 (bought at $185).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2024-01-30 * "SELL AAPL"
  Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL      -5 AAPL {185.00 USD} @ 190.00 USD
  Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:USD     950.00 USD
  Income:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL:Capital-Gains  -25.00 USD
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we specify the lot we’re selling (&lt;code&gt;{185.00 USD}&lt;/code&gt;) and the price we’re selling it at (&lt;code&gt;@ 190.00 USD&lt;/code&gt;). The difference is the capital gain (or loss).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the principle is identical: &lt;code&gt;Assets:Wise:INR&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Assets:Brokerage:AAPL&lt;/code&gt; are just accounts holding commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Automation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investments are very different from normal accounts in that they can be fully automated. No categorization needed: a buy is a buy, a dividend is a dividend. You don’t have new merchants to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means you can skip beancount-import’s web UI and run your beangulp importers directly with output going straight to the ledger. To help inspire you, I’ve open-sourced my personal collection of importers (IB, Vanguard, Schwab, and more) in the beancount-lalitm repo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Handling Account Sprawl&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, one annoyance is that creating those granular accounts for every single stock (&lt;code&gt;...:AAPL:Dividends&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;...:AAPL:Commissions&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) is tedious. To solve this, I wrote the ancillary_accounts plugin. Instead of manual account creation, you just add metadata to the main holding account:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2023-02-01 open Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:BAC    BAC
  ancillary_commission_currency: "USD"
  ancillary_distribution_currency: "USD"
  ancillary_withholding_tax_currency: "USD"
  ancillary_capital_gains_currency: "USD"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plugin automatically generates the corresponding income and expense accounts for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Corporate Actions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also use a plugin called stock_split to handle corporate actions. It retroactively adjusts historical transactions when a stock splits, keeping quantities and prices consistent with post-split values so your charts don’t show a sudden, fake drop in value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Value of Things (Prices)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have the quantities (10 AAPL, 98,000 INR), but to calculate a single “Net Worth” number, we need to know what they are worth in your home currency. This requires prices for both:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-4/src/prices.beancount
2024-01-10 price AAPL  185.50 USD  ; Stock price in USD
2024-01-10 price USD   0.79 GBP    ; Currency price in GBP
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I automate this using a daily CI job. A script fetches the latest stock prices and forex rates from AlphaVantage and commits them to &lt;code&gt;prices.beancount&lt;/code&gt;. You can find the script here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, I actually have three price files:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;prices.beancount&lt;/code&gt;- auto-fetched daily for as many securities as possible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;prices-manual.beancount&lt;/code&gt;- for securities without automatic feeds (like some pension funds). I input these manually once a month.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;prices-delisted.beancount&lt;/code&gt;- historical prices for securities no longer trading. This saves me from making API calls which would fail anyway.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Payoff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this data, Fava comes alive. To see the full potential of these reports, I’ve included a &lt;code&gt;demo/&lt;/code&gt; folder in the companion repo with 2+ years of history. Run &lt;code&gt;./scripts/quickstart.sh demo&lt;/code&gt; and you’ll see the payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Holdings page now shows your positions with their cost basis and current market value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Holdings report automatically calculates the market value of your assets using live price data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the demo environment, you can also see how plugins like fava-dashboards build custom visualizations. The plugin uses beanquery (Beancount’s SQL-like query language) to fetch data and renders interactive charts. It’s the best way to track long-term trends and asset allocation at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Custom dashboards (shown here using the demo data) allow you to track long-term trends and asset allocation at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with fava-portfolio-returns, you can calculate your true Time-Weighted Return (TWR) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) to see if you’re actually beating the market. It accounts for cash flows properly, so adding money mid-year doesn’t inflate your returns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The portfolio returns plugin (using the demo data) calculates your actual investment performance, net of cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Exit ramp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You now have a system that tracks your entire financial world: from the coffee you bought this morning to the capital gains in your brokerage account. For most people, this is a complete solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, as you collect more data, you’ll find you want to look at it in different ways. Maybe you want a simplified view for daily use and a detailed one for tax season. Or maybe you’re not the only person in your household. In the final chapters, we’ll see how to scale this system to handle multiple views and multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 5: Multiple Views&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day-to-day, I want a simple view of my finances. Take-home pay as a single number, investments without tax calculations cluttering the screen. But at tax time, I need detail. Every payslip line item and capital gains calculated the way HMRC wants them. Recording the same transaction twice would be maintenance hell. So instead, I extract multiple views from a single journal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think of these as “lenses” on the data. Some lenses aggregate: rolling up transactions into balances, summaries, or dashboards. Others transform: collapsing detail you don’t need day-to-day, or expanding it when you do. Both read from the same source files; nothing is duplicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Aggregated views&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fava is great for interactive exploration, but I also want textual snapshots I can version control. I have a script that generates daily summaries showing account balances, and a CI workflow that commits them automatically. In my setup this runs on a self-hosted Gitea instance on hardware I control, so the raw ledger never leaves machines I own. If you prefer, you can keep everything local-only or push to an encrypted remote; GitHub Actions works the same way if you’re comfortable with that trade-off. This gives me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A record of how balances changed day to day&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An immutable snapshot at tax time of what the system showed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Git as audit trail: “What was my net worth on March 15th 2023?” is answerable with &lt;code&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key script is archive.py. It uses the beanquery library to write SQL scripts over your journal and generate textual reports:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Generate balance sheet in GBP
sql = '''
  SELECT account,
         round(sum(number(convert(value(position, '2024-12-31'), 'GBP', '2024-12-31'))), 2) as value
  FROM OPEN ON 2024-01-01 CLOSE ON 2024-12-31 CLEAR
  GROUP BY account
  HAVING round(sum(number), 2) != 0
  ORDER BY account;
'''
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run this for each calendar year and tax year, generating files like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;networth.txt&lt;/code&gt;- Single-line net worth in each currency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;balance-sheet.txt&lt;/code&gt;- Net worth breakdown by account&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;holdings.txt&lt;/code&gt;- Investment positions with cost basis and market value&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what &lt;code&gt;networth.txt&lt;/code&gt; looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;     gbp            usd
-------------  -------------
 15978.42 GBP   19973.02 USD
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the concrete “one number I trust”: a single net-worth snapshot in my reporting currency, generated from the full ledger and price data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And &lt;code&gt;holdings.txt&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;account                           units  curr  avg_cost  price  book_val  mkt_val

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Gitea workflow is very simple too:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '00 7 * * *'  # Run daily at 7am

jobs:
  update:
    steps:
      - run: uv run scripts/archive.py outputs/ journal.beancount 2024-01-01 2024-12-31
      - run: git commit -am "Regen reports" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git push
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Transformed views&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I want to change how transactions work fundamentally. This is a more advanced technique: while Aggregated views read data, Transformed views temporarily rewrite it in memory to simplify reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have three transformed views, each for a different purpose:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Net - my daily driver. Collapses payslip details into a single take-home number.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gross - breaks down payslip line items for tax time analysis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CGT - a view that includes a “virtual currency” tracking capital gains the way my tax authority calculates them.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The linchpin is the &lt;code&gt;rename_accounts&lt;/code&gt; plugin. It lets me keep one copy of all transactions and rename accounts on the fly to show or hide detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gross vs net payslip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me start with the simpler example. In gross view, my payslip shows every line item:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2024-01-25 * "Google" "January salary"
  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP           3500.00 GBP  ; Take-home pay
  Income:Lalit:UK:Google:Salary           -5000.00 GBP  ; Gross salary
  Expenses:Lalit:UK:Google:Income-Tax        1000.00 GBP  ; Tax withheld
  Expenses:Lalit:UK:Google:National-Insurance 400.00 GBP  ; NI contribution
  Expenses:Lalit:UK:Google:Pension            100.00 GBP  ; Pension contribution
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Useful for analyzing my tax situation. But day-to-day, I don’t care about the breakdown. In net view, the same transaction collapses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-5/journal-net.beancount
include "journal.beancount"

plugin "beancount_reds_plugins.rename_accounts.rename_accounts" "{
  'Income:Lalit:UK:Google:Salary': 'Income:Lalit:UK:Google:Net-Income',
  'Income:Lalit:UK:Google:Bonus': 'Income:Lalit:UK:Google:Net-Income',
  'Expenses:Lalit:UK:Google:Income-Tax': 'Income:Lalit:UK:Google:Net-Income',
  'Expenses:Lalit:UK:Google:National-Insurance': 'Income:Lalit:UK:Google:Net-Income',
  'Expenses:Lalit:UK:Google:Pension': 'Income:Lalit:UK:Google:Net-Income',
}"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Income is stored as a negative number and Expenses as positive numbers, merging them into one account mathematically subtracts the tax from the gross pay, leaving just the net amount. The difference should be obvious if I compare the Income Statements on Fava:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Gross view is essential for tax season, but the detailed line items for taxes and insurance often dwarf your actual spending data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Net view collapses those details into a single take-home number, making your everyday expenses much easier to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Tracking capital gains for tax&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can use this same renaming technique to handle a much more complex beast: Capital Gains Tax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your broker reports one gain number, but your tax authority may calculate another. In the UK, where I live, we have specific rules like “Section 104 pooling” (averaging cost basis) and “bed-and-breakfasting” (wash sale rules).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To handle this, I use a virtual currency called &lt;code&gt;CGT-GBP&lt;/code&gt; that represents “pounds of gain HMRC cares about”. My plugin, &lt;code&gt;uk_cgt_lots&lt;/code&gt;, calculates this number and automatically appends a self-balancing pair of Equity postings to the original sale transaction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2024-06-15 * "SELL AAPL"
  Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL           -10 AAPL {150.00 USD} @ 175.00 USD
  Assets:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:USD            1750.00 USD
  Income:Lalit:US:IB:Brokerage:AAPL:Capital-Gains  -250.00 USD
  ; The following postings are generated by the uk_cgt_lots plugin:
  Equity:Taxable-Capital-Gains              195.00 CGT-GBP
  Equity:Taxable-Capital-Gains-Placeholder -195.00 CGT-GBP
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since both legs are in &lt;code&gt;Equity&lt;/code&gt;, they remain invisible on my Income Statement in my daily “Net” view. In fact, I use &lt;code&gt;rename_accounts&lt;/code&gt; to collapse them into a single account so they net to zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; journal-net.beancount
plugin "beancount_reds_plugins.rename_accounts.rename_accounts" "{
  'Equity:Taxable-Capital-Gains-Placeholder' : 'Equity:Taxable-Capital-Gains',
}"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when I want to see my tax liability, I switch to the CGT View. This view renames the “Placeholder” to a visible Revenue account:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; journal-cgt.beancount
plugin "beancount_reds_plugins.rename_accounts.rename_accounts" "{
  'Equity:Taxable-Capital-Gains-Placeholder' : 'Revenues:Taxable-Capital-Gains',
}"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the -195.00 becomes Revenue, which shows up as profit on my tax report. The matching +195.00 remains in Equity. This allows me to have “Schrödinger’s Capital Gains”: they exist for the taxman, but not for my daily budget, all controlled by which view I load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t calculate the tax owed since that’s too complicated with allowances, rates, and bands; the system just tracks the gains. At tax time, I sum up the CGT-GBP balance and do the actual calculation on the tax form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Exit ramp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By separating your “source of truth” from your “lenses,” you get a system that grows with you. You can add new plugins or virtual currencies to solve specific problems (like taxes) without ever touching the raw transactions you’ve already imported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the final chapter, we’ll see the ultimate application of this: combining two people’s financial lives into one unified view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 6: Two People, One Number&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got married at the start of the year, which brought a fundamental change to how I manage my finances. While many couples use joint accounts, we prefer to keep our individual accounts and perform occasional “normalization” transfers. However, we view our combined resources as shared household wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This created a reporting paradox that I had to solve in Beancount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Paradox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I transfer £500 to my wife for my share of the bills, two things are true simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Individual Truth: From my perspective, £500 is “gone” (an expense). From her perspective, £500 has “arrived” (income).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Household Truth: For the household, the net worth hasn’t changed. Money just moved from the left pocket to the right pocket.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a traditional system, you usually have to pick one truth. In Beancount, we can have both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Composable Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve this, I treat the household as a composable system of three distinct entities: Me, Her, and Shared Definitions. We use Beancount’s &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; feature to build the specific “lens” we need at any given moment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lalit’s View = Shared Definitions + Lalit’s Transactions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wife’s View = Shared Definitions + Wife’s Transactions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Household View = Shared Definitions + Lalit’s Transactions + Wife’s Transactions + Translation Logic&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the household view literally just includes the other files (alongside the translation logic we’ll see in a moment):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-6/total/journal-net.beancount
include "../common/src/commodities.beancount"
include "../common/src/accounts.beancount"

include "../lalit/src/journal.beancount"
include "../wife/src/journal.beancount"

; ... Translation Logic follows
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Implementation: The Directory Structure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This architecture is reflected directly in the repository structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chapter-6/
├── common/                    # Shared configuration
│   └── src/
│       ├── accounts.beancount   # Shared expense accounts (e.g. Expenses:Groceries)
│       └── commodities.beancount
├── lalit/                     # My stuff
│   ├── src/                   # My ledger
│   └── data/                  # My statement PDFs/CSVs
├── wife/                      # Wife's stuff
│   ├── src/                   # Her ledger
│   └── data/                  # Her statement PDFs/CSVs
└── total/                     # Combined household view
    └── journal-net.beancount  # Entry point with Translation Logic
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Rules of Engagement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this to work without constant manual adjustment, we follow two simple rules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rule 1: Assets and Liabilities are Private. Bank accounts always include the person’s name in the path (e.g., &lt;code&gt;Assets:Lalit:HSBC&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Assets:Wife:HSBC&lt;/code&gt;). We never use a generic &lt;code&gt;Assets:Checking&lt;/code&gt; account. Legal ownership of the cash always matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rule 2: Expenses are Public. Shared expenses like groceries or electricity use a generic name without a person prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-6/common/src/accounts.beancount
2024-01-01 open Expenses:Groceries                   GBP
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I buy groceries, I record it in my ledger using the shared account. We don’t track “who owes what” for individual grocery runs; we just track that the household spent the money. We accept that we lose the ability to split shared expenses by person, but the gain in simplicity is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The “Magic”: Solving the Transfer Paradox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we use the &lt;code&gt;rename_accounts&lt;/code&gt; plugin in the &lt;code&gt;total/&lt;/code&gt; folder to resolve the transfer paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my ledger, a transfer looks like a simple expense:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-6/lalit/src/transactions.beancount
2024-01-20 * "Transfer to Wife"
  Expenses:Lalit:Transfers:Wife       500.00 GBP
  Assets:Lalit:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In her ledger, it looks like income:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-6/wife/src/transactions.beancount
2024-01-20 * "Transfer from Lalit"
  Assets:Wife:UK:HSBC:Current:GBP     500.00 GBP
  Income:Wife:Transfers:Lalit
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Translation Logic” in the combined view renames these into a shared transit account:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; chapter-6/total/journal-net.beancount
plugin "beancount_reds_plugins.rename_accounts.rename_accounts" "{
  'Expenses:Lalit:Transfers:Wife': 'Assets:Household:Transfers:Internal',
  'Income:Wife:Transfers:Lalit': 'Assets:Household:Transfers:Internal',
}"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, when Fava loads the combined view, it sees £500 leave my account and enter &lt;code&gt;Assets:Household:Transfers:Internal&lt;/code&gt;, and then £500 leave that same account and enter her bank account. The transit account nets to zero, and our household net worth remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Result&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This setup gives us the best of both worlds. I can maintain my own financial autonomy and see my personal “runway,” while we can simultaneously monitor our combined progress toward shared goals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final result: a unified household view that tracks legal ownership without sacrificing the "One Number" net worth total.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the full system (see chapter-6 for the complete multi-person structure). But how do I actually use it week to week?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The weekly ritual&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now here’s how I keep it current: the “20 minutes a week” I mentioned at the start:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Getting statements: During the week, banks email me saying a statement is available. Some attach PDFs directly; others require a login. Either way, I snooze the emails (I use inbox zero) until the weekend. For my wife’s accounts, I nudge her once a month and she drops stuff in a shared Drive folder.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running imports: On the weekend, I work through my snoozed emails. Note that I’m not updating every single account every week. I only download statements for the 3-4 accounts that saw activity; long-term investments often just get a monthly or quarterly check-in. I move each file to the correct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;data/&lt;/code&gt;subfolder for that institution (e.g.,&lt;code&gt;data/hsbc-uk-current/&lt;/code&gt;). My importer pipeline automatically runs&lt;code&gt;pdftotext&lt;/code&gt;to extract text so the parsers can read it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Categorizing: I launch beancount-import, which opens a web UI in my browser:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;python -m beancount_import.webserver --journal lalit/journal-net.beancount&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, most transactions auto-categorize and I’m just hitting Enter: I buy groceries from the same place, pay my hosting costs to the same provider etc. New merchants do need some manual work, but it’s a matter of typing a few characters and again pressing Enter.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formatting and checking: I run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bean-format&lt;/code&gt;(a Beancount utility that normalizes indentation and aligns amounts) to keep my transactions file tidy. This makes git diffs cleaner. Then I open Fava for a quick sanity check:&lt;code&gt;fava lalit/journal-net.beancount&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are transfer accounts zeroed out? Do expenses look legit? How are investments doing? If it all checks out, commit and push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it. I try to stick to doing this every week, but sometimes I’m on holiday or just have other commitments. In that case, it’s 40 minutes every two weeks. The system is forgiving; I’m never behind for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also have some automation helping me out: during the week, I have a CI workflow that runs daily, regenerates summaries, and commits them. Whenever I want, I can check the repo and see what the numbers look like. I particularly like this because I can easily see the before/after numbers in a single file, so I can spot check “does this make sense”. And of course at any time, I can also open Fava if I want to go a bit deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That 2021 tax disaster feels like a lifetime ago. What started as “there must be a better way” became a system I actually trust. One number, always current, completely under my control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The specifics will evolve as life changes and tools improve, but three principles have held for years now. I expect them to hold for decades:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double-entry everywhere. Every transaction balances. Money never appears from nowhere or vanishes into nothing. When something doesn’t add up, you know immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plain text as the source of truth. Your financial history lives in files you can read, diff, grep, and version control. No vendor lock-in, no opaque databases, no trusting a third party with your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Track at the leaf. Record transactions at the most granular level that makes sense. You can always aggregate up (&lt;code&gt;Income:Dividends&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;Income:IB:AAPL:Dividends&lt;/code&gt;), but you can never disaggregate down. Capture the detail; collapse it later with views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finance systems are deeply personal. This post isn’t meant to say this is the system everyone should use, just what’s worked for me over several years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each chapter here could be its own post, so if you want me to go deeper on imports, investments, or the multi-person setup, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I started serving my blog posts as plain text. Add &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; to the end of any URl and get a deliciously lo-fi, UTF-8, mono[chrome|space] alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's this post in plain text - https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/a-small-collection-of-text-only-websites.txt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously a webpage without links is like a fish without a bicycle, but the joy of the web is that there are no gatekeepers. People can try new concepts and, if enough people join in, it becomes normal. I'm not saying the plain-text is the best web experience. But it is an experience. Perfect if you like your browsing fast, simple, and readable. There are no cookie banners, pop-ups, permission prompts, autoplaying videos, or garish colour schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm certainly not the first person to do this, so I thought it might be fun to gather a list of websites which you browse in text-only mode. If you know of any more - including your own site - please drop a comment in the box!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Terence Eden's blog - add &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt;to any URl.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Daring Fireball - add &lt;code&gt;.text&lt;/code&gt;to any URl.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Zach Flowers - replace &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Fabien Benetou's PIM - add &lt;code&gt;?action=source&lt;/code&gt;to any URl.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; M0YNG - add &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt;to any URl.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Gwern - add &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;to any URl or send an HTTP Accept for Markdown.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dan Q's textplain.blog - the entire blog is plain text!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Matt Hobbs - there is a feed of plaintext which allows you to read recent posts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you'd like to add a site, please get in touch. The rules are simple - content which has the MIME type of &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt;. No HTML, no multimedia, no RTF, no XML, no ANSI colour escape sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emoji are fine though; emoji are cool.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;January 2026 will mark 10 years since I started storing my personal finances in plain text files using Beancount. Since January 2016, I've taken out about 30-45 minutes every single month to download my monthly bank statements and import them into my Beancount ledger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a lot to talk about here, but let's start with some fun numbers!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The 10 year old Beancount ledger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10 years of financial transactions is a lot of data! All in all, my ledger contains over 45,000 lines of Beancount entries spread across 16 plain text files. All of it is stored in a &lt;code&gt;finances&lt;/code&gt; directory (version controlled) on my laptop. Here's a snapshot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;❯ find . -name "*.beancount" | xargs wc -l
    4037 ./includes/2020.beancount
    3887 ./includes/2018.beancount
      27 ./includes/cash.beancount
    4398 ./includes/2021.beancount
    5531 ./includes/2019.beancount
    5267 ./includes/2022.beancount
    3287 ./includes/2017.beancount
    5506 ./includes/2024.beancount
    5606 ./includes/2023.beancount
    1454 ./includes/2016.beancount
    1089 ./includes/open/04-expenses.beancount
      66 ./includes/open/03-income.beancount
      11 ./includes/open/05-liabilities.beancount
      37 ./includes/open/02-assets.beancount
       1 ./includes/open/01-equity.beancount
    4807 ./main.beancount
   45011 total
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;bean-query&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;main.beancount&lt;/code&gt; tells me I have about 10,000 transactions in
total, that in turn contain about 20,000 postings (in double-entry bookkeeping, one
transaction may have multiple postings).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;❯ uv run bean-query main.beancount
Input file: "Goel"
Ready with 12466 directives (19743 postings in 9895 transactions).
beanquery&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 1086 accounts in total.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;beanquery&amp;gt; select count(*) from (select distinct(account));
coun
----
1086
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;... which does not mean that there are 1086 bank accounts. Accounts in Beancount are virtual, and you can create as many as you like. Imagine one account for categorizing supermarket spending, one for tracking your income, one for your Netflix subscription, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, there are about 500 documents in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;❯ find documents/ -name "*.pdf" | wc -l
     507
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beancount lets you attach documents (e.g. receipts or invoices) to transactions, that makes bookkeeping very efficient. I love the fact that whenever I need to do my tax returns, I can just take a look at my Beancount ledger and find all the invoices right there next to the relevant transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, in terms of postings, I started out with 715 in the year 2016, and the year 2023 was the busiest so far in terms of just the total postings count.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;beanquery&amp;gt; select year(date), count(*) where year(date) &amp;lt; 2025 group by year(date);
year  coun
----  ----
2016   715
2017  1422
2018  1605
2019  2437
2020  1582
2021  2022
2022  2435
2023  2651
2024  2602
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Monthly Ritual&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote earlier that every month I take about 30-45 minutes to import my financial transactions into Beancount. What does that workflow look like? I wrote another, much more detailed blog post about it a few years ago, but here's a gist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It starts with me logging in to my bank account(s) to download my monthly statement(s) in CSV (CSV because it's much more predictable to parse compared to PDF). I then run these CSV files through what's called an "importer", that converts this CSV data into data structures that Beancount understands. I then append all those extracted entries into my current &lt;code&gt;.beancount&lt;/code&gt; file (which is the main file containing all my
financial transactions in plain text). I then go through each entry one by one and make
sure it's balanced (in double-entry bookkeeping, all the postings in a transaction must
sum to zero, and not all postings/transactions that an importer outputs are balanced).
Some of that balancing is manual and some of it is automated (e.g. the importer code can
look at the transaction's description and decide which account it should go into, and
balance automatically). This last part (balancing) is where most of those 30-45 minutes
go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever a new year starts, I move all the transactions from the past year into a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;year&amp;gt;.beancount&lt;/code&gt; file and add an &lt;code&gt;include &amp;lt;year.beancount&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the active
&lt;code&gt;main.beancount&lt;/code&gt;file, mostly to avoid the main file from becoming too long. Not that it
would be an issue for Beancount, but just for the sake of readability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With such a workflow, all my financial transactions from the beginning of time are contained in a few plain text files in one directory on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building Beancount Importers for German Banks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beancount only provides the foundations for working with money, but it has no knowledge of what your bank statements look like. This is where the concept of an importer comes in. An importer is a (Python) class that takes in a bank statement of sorts (e.g. a CSV export of your transactions) and converts them into something that Beancount can work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I live in Germany and my bank accounts are with German banks, so I had to write a few importers for a few different banks, specifically beancount-dkb, beancount-ing, beancount-n26, and beancount-commerzbank. I closed out my Commerzbank account a while ago, so I don't maintain that integration anymore, but the first three libraries are actively maintained (and used)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From User to Author&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My start with Beancount was a bit bumpy. The documentation is very comprehensive but as a newcomer, I found it tricky to get a grasp on the overall workflow. It took me some trial and error to figure things out and have that "aha" moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured that if I found it tricky, maybe it's tricky for others as well. So I wrote a short book to help newcomers get up and running with Beancount easily. If you're interested, here's a link: https://personalfinancespython.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feedback on the book has been super positive. It got mentioned on Beancount's external contributions page, and the reader reviews have all been very encouraging!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having all my finances in a bunch of plain text files tracked in a git repository feels invaluable to me. And hitting the 10 years mark on that almost feels like a milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the nicest bit about all this is that this data is sitting on my own machine, not in some data center somewhere else. All of it is in plain text files that I can open up in my editor, and analyze using the tools that the Beancount ecosystem gives me. All of it will outlive any app or service, and that, I feel, is why plaintext accounting is so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Assorted less(1) tips&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In a recent discussion on Reddit I shared a number of tips about the common utility &lt;code&gt;less(1)&lt;/code&gt;
that others found helpful
so I figured I'd aggregate some of those tips here.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Operating on multiple files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; While most folks invoke &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;
at the tail of a pipeline like


you can directly provide one or more files to open

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Adding files after starting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; When reading a document, sometimes you want to view another file, adding it to the file list. Perhaps while reading some C source code you want to also look over the corresponding header-file. You can add that header-file to the argument list with &lt;code&gt;:e file.h&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Navigating multiple files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; You can navigate between multiple files using &lt;code&gt;:n&lt;/code&gt;
to go to the next file in the argument-list, and
&lt;code&gt;:p&lt;/code&gt;
for the previous file.
You can also use
&lt;code&gt;:x&lt;/code&gt;
to rewind to the first file in the argument-list
similar to how
&lt;code&gt;:rewind&lt;/code&gt;
behaves in
&lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Removing files after starting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; While I rarely feel the need to, if you have finished with a file and want to keep your argument list clean, you can use &lt;code&gt;:d&lt;/code&gt;
to delete the current file from the argument-list.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Navigating&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Jumping to a particular line-number&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Use &lt;code&gt;Â«countÂ»G&lt;/code&gt;
to jump to a particular line-number.
So using
&lt;code&gt;3141G&lt;/code&gt;
will jump to line 3141.
It helps to display
line numbers.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Jumping to a particular percentage-offset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Similarly, using &lt;code&gt;Â«countÂ»%&lt;/code&gt;
jumps to that percentage-offset of the file.
So if you want to go to Â¾
of the way through the file, you can type
&lt;code&gt;75%&lt;/code&gt;
to jump right there.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Searching&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; While many folks know you can search forward with &lt;code&gt;/Â«patternÂ»&lt;/code&gt;
and some people know you can use
&lt;code&gt;?Â«patternÂ»&lt;/code&gt;
to search backwards,
or use
&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;
to search again for the next/previous match,
&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;
provides modifiers you can specify
before the pattern to modify its behavior:
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;Find the next line that doesn't match the pattern&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;search across multiple files, starting from the current location in the current file&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;rewind to the first file and search from there&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;@*&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-4"&gt;rewind to the first file and search from there across multiple files&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Thus you would use &lt;code&gt;/@*Â«patternÂ»&lt;/code&gt;
to search for "pattern"
starting with the first file.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Filtering lines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Using &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;
lets you specify a pattern
and filter the displayed lines
to only those matching the pattern,
much like an internal
&lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;
command.
If you modify it with
&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;,
so it will display only those lines that do
not match
the pattern, like
&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;!Â«patternÂ»&lt;/code&gt;.
I find this particularly helpful for browsing log-files.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bookmarking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; You can bookmark points in a file with &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;
followed by a letter,
then jump back to that bookmark with
&lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;
followed by the same letter.
These apply globally across all open files,
so if you
&lt;code&gt;ma&lt;/code&gt;
in the third file,
then navigate away to other files,
using
&lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt;
will take you back to the marked location
in that third file.
I use marks most when reading man-pages,
dropping one mark at the
OPTIONS
section such as
&lt;code&gt;mo&lt;/code&gt;,
and another at the
EXAMPLES
section,
such as
&lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt;,
then bounce back and forth between them with
&lt;code&gt;'o&lt;/code&gt;
and
&lt;code&gt;'e&lt;/code&gt;.
While you can use any of
the 26 lowercase or uppercase letters
(for a total of 52 marks),
I rarely use more than two or three
either in alphabetical order
("a", "b", "c"),
or assigning mnemonics like in the
&lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;-page example above.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bracket matching&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; If the first line on the screen contains a &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;,
or
&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;,
typing that character
will jump to the matching/closing character,
putting it on the bottom line of the screen.
Similarly, if a closing
&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;,
or
&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;,
character appears on the last line,
typing that closing character
will jump to the matching/opening character,
putting it at the top of the screen.
I find it a little disorienting
if they fall &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt; than a screen-height apart
because what feels like a forward motion
to find the next matching close-bracket
might actually result in shifting the screen
down
rather than
up
which feels backwards.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; While I don't use it much, you can also specify match-pairs using &lt;code&gt;alt+ctrl+f&lt;/code&gt;
or
&lt;code&gt;alt+ctrl+b&lt;/code&gt;
followed by the opening/closing pair of characters
such as
&lt;code&gt;alt+ctrl+f&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
to define a "&amp;lt;"â¦"&amp;gt;" pair
and jump between them
in a manner similar to the
&lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;,
and
&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
motions.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Toggling options without restarting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; While the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;-page
documents many flags you can pass
on the command-line,
you can also toggle boolean options from inside
&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;.
I find this particularly helpful
when I've fed the output of a long-running process to
&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;
and don't want to re-run it
because it will take a long time.
Instead of quitting,
you can type a literal
&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;
followed by the option you want to change.
I most commonly want to toggle word-wrap for long lines,
so instead of quitting and adding
&lt;code&gt;-S&lt;/code&gt;
at the end of my pipeline,
I can type
&lt;code&gt;-S&lt;/code&gt;
directly in
&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;.
Options I commonly toggle:
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;-S&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;word-wrap (mnemonic "splitting long lines")&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;-G&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;search-highlighting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;smart-case/case-sensitivity for searches&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;-R&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-4"&gt;ANSI-color escaping&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-5"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-N&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-5"&gt;show/hide line-numbers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Running external commands&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;
lets you invoke an external command.
I don't do this often,
but occasionally I want some simple reference
like the current date
(&lt;code&gt;!date&lt;/code&gt;)
or to do some simple math
(&lt;code&gt;!bc&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Default options with &lt;code&gt;$LESS&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; You might find yourself regularly setting a common group of options so you can put those in your environment (usually in your shell startup file like &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;)
like
&lt;code&gt;LESS="-RNe"&lt;/code&gt;
if you want to
show ANSI colors,
show line-numbers,
and exit automatically when you reach the end of the file.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other misc&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;
has a few other corners that I've never really used,
but figured I'd document here:
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tags&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; While I've used tags in &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;
to easily jump between definitions.
However, even though
&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;
provides support for tags generated by
&lt;code&gt;ctags&lt;/code&gt;.
I've never found cause to use them.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Editing the current document&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;
command will open your
&lt;code&gt;$VISUAL&lt;/code&gt;
editor on the current document.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"Log" output&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;
lets you redirect the output
it has gathered from
stdin
to a file using the
&lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;
command
(or the
&lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;
command to overwrite an existing file).
This might come in handy because
&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;
won't let you
edit stdin
in an external editor
but you can write it directly to a file.
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;FracturedJson is a family of utilities that format JSON data in a way that's easy for humans to read, but fairly compact. Arrays and objects are written on single lines, as long as they're neither too long nor too complex. When several such lines are similar in structure, they're written with fields aligned like a table. Long arrays are written with multiple items per line across multiple lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of settings available to control the output, but usually you can ignore most of them. FracturedJson produces nice-looking output from any set of JSON data automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try it out with the browser formatter page. It's also available as a .NET library, a JavaScript/Typescript package, and a Visual Studio Code extension. See here for Python options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a sample of output using default settings. See the Options page for examples of what you different settings do.&lt;/p&gt;

    ]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optionally, comments can be preserved. Comments aren't allowed by the official JSON standard, but they're ubiquitous, so it's nice to have the option. FracturedJson tries to keep the comments together with whatever elements they seem to relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most JSON libraries give you a choice between two formatting options. Minified JSON is very efficient, but difficult for a person to read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{"AttackPlans":[{"TeamId":1,"Spawns":[{"Time":0.0,"UnitType":"Grunt","SpawnPointIndex":0},{"Time":0.0,"UnitType":"Grunt","SpawnPointIndex":0},{"Time":0.0,"UnitType":"Grunt","SpawnPointIndex":0}]}],"DefensePlans":[{"TeamId":2,"Placements":[{"UnitType":"Archer","Position":[41,7]},{"UnitType":"Pikeman","Position":[40,7]},{"UnitType":"Barricade","Position":[39,7]}]}]}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most beautified/indented JSON, on the other hand, is too spread out, often making it difficult to take in quickly or to scan for specific information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
    "AttackPlans": [
        {
            "TeamId": 1,
            "Spawns": [

                    "UnitType": "Barricade",
                    "Position": [
                        39,
                        7
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FracturedJson tries to format data like a person would. Containers are kept to single lines as long as they're not too complex and not too long. If several successive inline arrays or objects are similar enough, they will be formatted as a table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
    "AttackPlans" : [
        {
            "TeamId": 1,
            "Spawns": [
                {"Time": 0, "UnitType": "Grunt", "SpawnPointIndex": 0},
                {"Time": 0, "UnitType": "Grunt", "SpawnPointIndex": 0},
                {"Time": 0, "UnitType": "Grunt", "SpawnPointIndex": 0}
            ]
        }
    ],
    "DefensePlans": [
        {
            "TeamId"    : 2,
            "Placements": [
                { "UnitType": "Archer",    "Position": [41, 7] },
                { "UnitType": "Pikeman",   "Position": [40, 7] },
                { "UnitType": "Barricade", "Position": [39, 7] }
            ]
        }
    ]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FracturedJson uses four types of formatting: inlined, compact multiline array, table and expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When possible, sections of the document are written inlined, as long as that doesn't make them too long or too complex (as determined by the settings). "Complexity" refers to how deeply nested an array or object's contents are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{ "UnitType": "Archer", "Position": [41, 7] }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the setting MaxInlineComplexity to control how much nesting is allowed on one line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next option, for arrays, is to write them with multiple items per line, across multiple lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[
    [19,  2], [ 3,  8], [14,  0], [ 9,  9], [ 9,  9], [ 0,  3], [10,  1],
    [ 9,  1], [ 9,  2], [ 6, 13], [18,  5], [ 4, 11], [12,  2]
]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the setting MaxCompactArrayComplexity to control how deeply nested items can be when arranged this way, or use &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; to disable this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If an array or object contains inlineable items of the same type, they can be formatted in a tabular format. With enough room, all fields at any depth are lined up (and reordered if necessary).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
    "Rect" : { "position": {"x": -44, "y":  3.4         }, "color": [0, 255, 255] },
    "Point": { "position": {          "y": 22   , "z": 3}                         },
    "Oval" : { "position": {"x": 140, "y":  0.04        }, "color": "#7f3e96"     },
    "Plane": { "position": null,                           "color": [0, 64, 64]   }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the table wouldn't fit with all of the elements and subelements aligned, the inner-most containers are collapsed while keeping the outer ones still aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
    "Rect" : { "position": {"x": -44, "y": 3.4},  "color": [0, 255, 255] },
    "Point": { "position": {"y": 22, "z": 3}                             },
    "Oval" : { "position": {"x": 140, "y": 0.04}, "color": "#7f3e96"     },
    "Plane": { "position": null,                  "color": [0, 64, 64]   }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the setting MaxTableRowComplexity to control how how deeply nested rows can be, or use &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; to disable this feature.  Use TableCommaPlacement to adjust where commas are placed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If none of those options work for an element, it will be written across multiple lines, with child items indented and starting on its own line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[
    {
        "type" : "turret",
        "hp"   : 400,
        "loc"  : {"x": 47, "y": -4},
        "flags": ["stationary"]
    },
    {
        "type" : "assassin",
        "hp"   : 80,
        "loc"  : {"x": 102, "y": 6},
        "flags": ["stealth"]
    },
    { "type": "berserker", "hp": 150, "loc": {"x": 0, "y": 0} },
    {
        "type" : "pittrap",
        "loc"  : {"x": 10, "y": -14},
        "flags": ["invulnerable", "stationary"]
    }

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I found that a grown man had been texting my twelve-year-old son on his "kid-safe" Gabb phone. The man got my son's number through a children's book chat on an app called GroupMe. Thankfully my wife and I discovered the situation and intervened before anything bad happened; but still it was sickening to discover that on Christmas morning, while our family was unwrapping presents next to the tree, some creep had been texting my son: "What did you get? Send pictures."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How could we have let this happen? How could we be such careless parents?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But wait . . . hadn't we done what we were supposed to do? We bought the "kid-safe" phone. And we confirmed GroupMe was on the Gabb "approved apps" list, which, as I understand it, offers "no social media or high-risk options." We did the safe things, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe not. Turns out Gabb's own blog appears to include GroupMe on a list of seven apps with dangerous chat features, describing it as an app that "opens the door to potential dangers." We were apparently supposed to find that warning ourselves, somewhere among Gabb's 572 blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ curl -s \
  https://gabb.com/post-sitemap.xml \
  | grep -oE 'https://gabb\.com/blog/[^&amp;lt;]+' \
  | sort -u \
  | wc -l \
  | xargs -I{} echo "{} blog posts as of $(date '+%B %d, %Y')"

572 blog posts as of January 02, 2026&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if GroupMe "opens the door" to danger, why did Gabb put it on their "approved apps" list? When I revisited the site, I noticed a small message beneath GroupMe mentioning Communication with Strangers. I hovered over it with my mouse pointer, and a tooltip appeared: "Allows contact and communication with people the child may not know."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it allows communication with strangers, but it's not "high-risk?" The approved list isn't looking so safe. The approved list is apparently a catalog of risks I'm supposed to decipher by filtering through 838 apps and hovering my mouse pointer around to see tooltips:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ for cat in \
  existing_apps \
  unapproved_apps \
  unmet_criteria_apps \
  music_apps; do
  count=$(curl -s "https://gabb.com/app-guide/" \
    | grep -o "${cat} = \[.*\]" \
    | head -1 \
    | sed "s/${cat} = \[//" \
    | sed "s/\]//" \
    | tr ',' '\n' \
    | sed "s/'//g" \
    | sed 's/^ *//' \
    | sort -u \
    | wc -l \
    | tr -d ' ')
  echo "$count $cat"
done &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo "...as of $(date '+%B %d, %Y')"

586 existing_apps
60 unapproved_apps
170 unmet_criteria_apps
22 music_apps
...as of January 02, 2026&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason for this complexity, I don't feel in control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Gabb isn't alone in making me feel like this. It seems like many companies selling tech to families operate in the same way: market safety, deliver complexity, and leave parents to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take the Nintendo Switch my son unwrapped between those creepy texts. To set it up, I had to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only to discover that there's no clear option to block internet access, no clear way to disable downloads from the Nintendo eShop, and no easy way to make this thing function like an old-school Game Boy and just let a kid have fun with a game cartridge. But that's just nostalgia talking. Nobody wants that anymore. Apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because next comes Minecraft. Ah, Minecraft. The game every middle-schooler on earth apparently needs to survive. To let my son play with his friends:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I did my best to configure these settings. I really did. But xbox.com alone includes twenty-nine confusingly overlapping settings related to chat, friends, and communication. Twenty-nine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when I finally—finally—tried to test online play, Minecraft told me I would need to loosen the parental controls (it did not say which) and create a Nintendo Switch Online account for my son.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nintendo Switch Online (not really another account, mind you, but a membership) involves a recurring fee. It also unlocks access to the Nintendo eShop, which I cannot disable. I can set his eShop spending limit to zero, sure. But I can't block free downloads. So to let my son play online Minecraft with his friends, I have to open him up to an unrelated store full of content I can't possibly evaluate. That's the deal. Take it or leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I assume some marketing person at Nintendo, probably sitting in a conference room in Kyoto, surrounded by whiteboards covered in arrows and cartoon stick figures, has this entire process mapped out as a "customer journey." And by Step 17, the journey is supposed to be over. You're supposed to be so beaten down, so utterly depleted of will, that you just cave. You sign up for Nintendo Online. You disable a bunch of parental controls you don't really understand. You let your kid play his damn game. You become the ideal customer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I didn't cave. Instead, somewhere on the threshold of Customer Journey Step 18, I found myself gripping the Switch with both hands and imagining, quite vividly, what it would feel like to lift the Switch up, and bring it down over my knee. I could almost hear the crack. Could almost see that OLED display splintering into a thousand pieces. The little Joy-Cons skittering across the floor. My son's face. My wife's face. The stunned silence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did not break the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I did was announce, in a voice louder than necessary, that nobody was to ask me about anything Minecraft-related on the Nintendo Switch for a minimum of two weeks. My son could play Zelda: Breath of the Wild instead, which, thank you, developers, thank you from the bottom of my heart, doesn't appear to involve any mandatory online anything whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what I want: an off switch. A single setting that says "this child cannot go online, communicate with strangers, spend money, or download anything without my explicit permission." Instead I get a maze, complex enough that when something goes wrong, I'm at fault for a tooltip I didn't hover over, a blog post I didn't read, a submenu I didn't find. Maybe that's by design. Maybe it's neglect. I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I know is this. My son just wants to play video games and talk to his friends. I just want to keep him safe. Somewhere between those two things, I'm supposed to become an expert in the convoluted parental control schemes of Gabb, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Xbox, while a stranger's Christmas morning texts sit in my son's phone history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parental controls shouldn't be this hard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;IPv6 just turned 30 and still hasn’t taken over the world, but don't call it a failure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The world has passed it by in many ways, yet it remains relevant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feature In the early 1990s, internetworking wonks realized the world was not many years away from running out of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses, the numbers needed to identify any device connected to the public internet. Noting booming interest in the internet, the internet community went looking for ways to avoid an IP address shortage that many feared would harm technology adoption and therefore the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A possible fix arrived in December 1995 in the form of RFC 1883, the first definition of IPv6, the planned successor to IPv4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important change from IPv4 to IPv6 was moving from 32-bit to 128-bit addresses, a decision that increased the available pool of IP addresses from around 4.3 billion to over 340 undecillion – a 39-digit number. IPv6 was therefore thought to have future-proofed the internet, because nobody could imagine humanity would ever need more than a handful of undecillion IP addresses, never mind the entire range available under IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As billions of devices and people came online, first using PCs and then wielding smartphones, conventional wisdom assumed that network operators would move to IPv6 rather than persist with IPv4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet according to data from Google, the Asia Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC), and Cloudflare, less than half of all netizens use IPv6 today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand why, know that IPv6 also suggested other, rather modest, changes to the way networks operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"IPv6 was an extremely conservative protocol that changed as little as possible," APNIC chief scientist Geoff Huston told The Register. "It was a classic case of mis-design by committee."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that notional committee made one more critical choice: IPv6 was not backward-compatible with IPv4, meaning users had to choose one or the other – or decide to run both in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many, the decision of which protocol to use was easy because IPv6 didn't add features that represented major improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"One big surprise to me was how few features went into IPv6 in the end, aside from the massive expansion of address space," said Bruce Davie, a veteran computer scientist recently honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Data Communications, which lauded him for "fundamental contributions in networking systems through design, standardization, and commercialization of network protocols and systems."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Davie said many of the security, plug-and-play, and quality of service features that didn't make it into IPv6 were eventually implemented in IPv4, further reducing the incentive to adopt the new protocol. "Given the small amount of new functionality in v6, it's not so surprising that deployment has been a 30 year struggle," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another innovation that meant IPv6 made less sense was network address translation (NAT), which allows many devices to share a single public IPv4 address. NAT meant IPv4 network operators could connect thousands of devices with a single IP address, meaning their existing IP addresses became more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These solutions were relatively easy to deploy, aligned with existing expertise, and avoided large-scale infrastructure changes," said Alvaro Vives, manager of the learning and development team at RIPE NCC, the regional internet registry for 76 nations across Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because NAT stalled IPv6 adoption, vendors didn't rally behind the new protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Migration costs, complexity, and training requirements remain high, while short-term ROI is low," Gartner distinguished VP analyst Andrew Lerner told The Register. "Performance parity across applications and devices is inconsistent, and some organizations even disable IPv6 for better performance. Lack of dual-stack support in legacy infrastructure is another barrier," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A misunderstood protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While IPv6 didn't take off as expected, it's not fair to say it failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"IPv6 wasn't about turning IPv4 off, but about ensuring the internet could continue to grow without breaking," said John Curran, president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"In fact, IPv4's continued viability is largely because IPv6 absorbed that growth pressure elsewhere – particularly in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments," he added. "In that sense, IPv6 succeeded where it was needed most, and must be regarded as a success."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RIPE NCC's Alvaro Vives agrees. "What IPv6 got right was its long-term design," he told The Register. "It provides a vast address space that allows networks to be planned more simply and consistently. This has enabled innovation, from large mobile networks to the Internet of Things and advanced routing techniques such as Segment Routing over IPv6."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unofficial IETF draft calls for grant of five nonillion IPv6 addresses to ham radio operators&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IETF Draft suggests making IPv6 standard on DNS resolvers - partly to destroy IPv4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;China's IPv6 adoption takes a decent leap forward, especially on fixed networks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Asia reaches 50 percent IPv6 capability and leads the world in user numbers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gartner's Lerner thinks the time has come for organizations to develop detailed IPv6 migration plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Validate application compatibility, and ensure new infrastructure supports IPv6," he advised. "Pilot deployments and lab testing with DNS64/NAT64 are recommended. Over time, IPv6 adoption will accelerate as private IPv4 space depletes and cloud providers introduce pricing models that favor IPv6."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;APNIC's Huston, however, thinks that IPv6 has become less relevant to the wider internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I would argue that we actually found a far better outcome along the way," he told The Register. "NATS forced us to think about network architectures in an entirely different way."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That new way is encapsulated in a new technology called Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC), that doesn't require client devices to always have access to a public IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We are proving to ourselves that clients don't need permanent assignment of IP address, which makes the client side of network far cheaper, more flexible, and scalable," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huston thinks IPv6 has also become less relevant to servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These days the Domain Name Service (DNS) is the service selector, not the IP address," Huston told The Register. "The entire security framework of today's Internet is name based and the world of authentication and channel encryption is based on service names, not IP addresses."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"So folk use IPv6 these days based on cost: If the cost of obtaining more IPv4 addresses to fuel bigger NATs is too high, then they deploy IPv6. Not because it's better, but if they are confident that they can work around IPv6's weaknesses then in a largely name based world there is no real issue in using one addressing protocol or another as the transport underlay."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there are plenty of organizations that still see a need for IPv6. Huawei sought 2.56 decillion IPv6 addresses and Starlink appears to have acquired150 sextillion, which is helping to push more countries past 50 percent IPv6 adoption. ®&lt;/p&gt;

Unveils MC03 Smartphone</title><link>https://www.punkt.ch/blogs/news/punkt-unveils-mc03</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="bc993addacb595dc"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Punkt. unveils MC03, latest version of its unique smartphone offering giving users full control over personal data and usage.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Made in Europe, the MC03 has an updated and more sustainable design and evolved features, with security and privacy at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2 January 2026, Lugano, Switzerland / CES, Las Vegas. Punkt. , the Swiss-based pioneer of beautifully designed, minimalist smartphones that give users privacy without friction, will be present at CES with its latest model, the MC03. This unique device, powered by AphyOS and housed within a German-built precision handset, follows through on Punkt.’s well known commitment to intentional tech use and data ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like its forerunner, the MC02, the new model is a subscription-based smartphone that offers users the tools and apps that are most important to them in an environment where they control access to their data and usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the Punkt. MC03, users can put privacy first with two defined repositories for depositing data. The first is named Vault, a protected enclave containing only trusted, Punkt.-approved apps and offering maximum privacy by default with a calm, design-focused user interface. The second, termed Wild Web, provides the freedom to install any app, but with strict, visible safeguards that allow easy privacy controls and can prevent data triangulation and unauthorized data flows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Privacy is being sought by people more than ever before, particularly as we enter the age of AI,” said Petter Neby, Founder and CEO at Punkt. “They are stressed and overwhelmed by the determination of Big Tech to track and monetise their every online movement. Punkt. offers them a solution – a modern, premium device without the need to compromise on their privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MC03 features a new look and feel to its operating system allowing users to stay laser-focused on getting the best experience. AphyOS cuts out tracking and profiling technology, bloatware, hidden apps and unwieldy background services. It eliminates spying and runs hardened code to block attacks, assisted by a bank-grade Secure Element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the MC03, Punkt. is building a secure smartphone ecosystem where privacy is not an add-on, but the default. Supported by trusted partners such as Threema and, new for MC03, Proton, these services feature in the device’s Vault space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trusted services including Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, Proton Drive, Proton VPN and Proton Pass are available in an environment designed to minimize data exposure and tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Punkt. and Proton are ideal partners, both leading within the Swiss Tech movement (with Swiss Tech you pay to retain your data, with Big Tech you pay with your data), operating independently and built around the principle that users, not platforms, control their own data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andy Yen, Founder and CEO of Proton said, “People deserve choice. Choice over the phone they use, the software they rely on and who they share their data with. By working with likeminded companies like Punkt., we can give users more ways to regain control of their privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Among other features of the MC03:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The App Hub&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two app stores are available:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A curated privacy-friendly store vetted by AphyOS and Punkt.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access to all widely available apps, activated only when chosen by the user.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Premium Hardware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manufactured at the Gigaset facility in Germany, the device delivers cutting-edge engineering for quality, security, repairability and sustainability, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;120Hz OLED HDR display&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Removable 5200mAh battery&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IP68 water and dust resistance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;64MP main camera&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digital Nomad&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MC03 retains its built-in VPN, Digital Nomad, protecting connectivity and privacy wherever users are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ledger&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users control app-specific privacy, from full access to full restriction. Ledger also includes a Carbon Reduction feature, giving insights into the energy impact of installed apps and control over background activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The MC03 builds on the success of the MC02 in privacy, control and security,” continued Petter Neby. “It delivers modern features with simplicity and minimal distraction.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Punkt. MC03 is priced at CHF / $ / €699.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t pay for a product, you are the product. With MC03, you pay to retain your data rather than paying with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 12-month subscription to AphyOS from Apostrophy is included. After that, continuation requires a paid subscription:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monthly at CHF / $ / €9.99&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subscription bundles are available, including a 3-year subscription at 45% discount and a 5-year subscription at 60% discount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MC03 is available to pre-order now, with deliveries in Europe at the end of January and North America from Spring 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! Absolutely. Communicator is a fully standalone smartphone that runs Android 16, with all the apps, 5G connectivity and Wi-fi. We think many people will use this as their primary phone while others will use it as a complement to a flagship iPhone, Galaxy, Pixel, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâre on track to ship Clicks Communicator orders later this year. Shipping timelines will be confirmed once manufacturing enters its final stage. Early customers will receive priority fulfillment. Follow along at @ClicksKeys on Instagram and www.Clicks.tech&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicator will support 5G, 4GLTE, 3G/2G global bands and be sold unlocked. &lt;lb/&gt;5G NR: n41, n77, n78, n1, n2, n3, n5, n7, n8, n12, n13, n14, n20, n25, n26, n28, n38, n40, n41, n48, n66, n71, n77, n78&lt;lb/&gt;5G NR (4Ã4 MIMO): n1, n2, n3, n7, n25, n38, n40, n41, n48, n66, n77, n78LTE (4G):&lt;lb/&gt;FDD: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B7, B8, B12, B13, B14, B17, B18, B19, B20, B25, B26, B28, B66, B71&lt;lb/&gt;TDD: B34, B38, B39, B40, B41, B42, B483G / 2G:&lt;lb/&gt;WCDMA: B1, B2, B4, B5, B6, B8, B9, B19&lt;lb/&gt;GSM: B2, B3, B5, B8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicator will be sold unlocked, supporting a number of the most popular 5G, 4GLTE, 3G/2G global bands. We will evaluate carrier certification as we approach availability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a real keyboard with the QWERTY layout, Communicator supports languages that use the Latin alphabet: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Dutch, Japanese, Estonian, Faroese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Turkish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this stage of development itâs too early to project battery life. Battery life has been a core design priority from day one. Thatâs why weâre combining a 4,000 mAh silicon-carbon battery with a 4.03â AMOLED display and a modern 4-nanometer SoC that will work together to deliver an efficient power management experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicator will run Android 16. Weâre comfortable committing to 2 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicator uses a modern 4-nanometer, 5G IoT SoC platform from MediaTek&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicator packs a 4.03â AMOLED display with a 1080 x 1200 resolution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main (rear facing) camera: 50MP, autofocus with optical image stabilization&lt;lb/&gt;Front facing camera: 24MP fixed focus&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reservation program allows you to reserve a Clicks Communicator prior to general availability. By placing a reservation, you secure priority access to purchase a Clicks Communicator when ordering opens. There are two options available: a Reservation Deposit of $199 USD (applied toward the final purchase price at checkout) or a Full Reservation of $399 USD (Early Bird Price), which represents payment of the full purchase price in advance. When ordering opens ahead of shipment, reservation holders will be invited to configure and complete their Communicator order. Please see the full Terms of Reservation for details on our reservation program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. You may cancel at any time before your reservation converts into an order for a full refund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reservation holders will be invited to configure their Communicator closer to our first production run. Stay tuned for updates!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voice over internet calling (like WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook) will carry over from your primary phone. If you want to make and receive traditional phone calls over cellular networks, a second SIM/phone number will be required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! Communicator will support both a physical (nano) SIM card and eSIM. The nano-SIM slot is found beneath the back cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The limited warranty runs for a period of one year from the date of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closer to availability we will contact customers who have purchased reservations to configure your Communicator (colors, covers, etc.). You will be asked to confirm your shipping address at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâre focused on shipping Communicator with QWERTY at this time. QWERTY will support a broad range of latin character based language. We will monitor interest in other keyboard layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We currently ship to the United States, Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Oman, Turkey, Egypt, Australia, New Zealand, Paraguay, and across Europe, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Poland, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Austria, Sweden, Greece, Ireland, Croatia, Portugal, Denmark, Slovenia, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Finland, Lithuania, Montenegro, Guernsey, Gibraltar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, the Isle of Man, Kosovo, and Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Published by Martin Kleppmann on 07 Mar 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Every educated person really ought to have a basic understanding of accounting. Just like maths, science, programming, music, literature, history, etc., itâs one of those things which helps you make sense of the world. Although dealing with money is not much fun, itâs an unavoidable part of life, so you might as well take a few minutes to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sadly, in my opinion, most accountants do a terrible job of explaining their work in an accessible way; itâs a field full of jargon, acronyms and weird historical legacies. Even âBookkeeping for Dummiesâ makes my head spin. Surely this stuff canât be that difficult?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(We computing people are probably guilty of the same offence of bad explanations and jargon. The problem is, once you have become intimately familiar with a field, itâs very hard to imagine how you thought about things before you understood it.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Eventually I figured it out: basic accounting is just graph theory. The traditional ways of representing financial information hide that structure astonishingly well, but once I had figured out that it was just a graph, it suddenly all made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Iâm a computer scientist, and I think of stuff in graphs all the time. If only someone had explained it like that in the first place! It would have saved me so much confusion. So I want to try to fix that. If you like graphs, then by the time you reach the end of this article, you should know everything you need in order to understand the financial statements for a small company/startup (and even calculate them yourself, in a spreadsheet or programming language of your choice).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Itâs really not that hard. Letâs go!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Accounts = Nodes, Transactions = Edges&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Say you go to the bagel shop and buy a Super Club bagel for $5 on the company credit card. You also visit some random Silicon Valley startup and buy one of their surplus Aeron chairs, second hand, for $500 (by writing a cheque from the company account). Those are two transactions. Each transaction is an edge in our graph, and the edge is labelled with the amount.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An edge always goes from one node to another. What are those nodes? Well, you can define them as you like (although there are some conventions). For now, letâs say:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Letâs add some more details. You pay the $5 credit card bill from the company account. And where did the money in the company account come from in the first place? Ah, I see, you put in $5,000 of your savings to start the company. Ok, now the graph looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hopefully pretty self-explanatory so far. Money flows in the direction of the arrows.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hungry once again, you go to the taqueria and buy a Super Burrito for $8 on the credit card. Now we could create another node for the taqueria, but this is starting to get messy â we donât really care how much money we spent on bagels vs. how much on burritos. Letâs just lump them together as âfoodâ. Also, âRandom startupâ is a bit unhelpful â Iâve already forgotten what those $500 were for. Letâs call it âfurnitureâ instead.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;See, thatâs perfectly fine. We can have nodes which represent actual bank accounts or cards, others which represent people or companies, and others again which represent abstract categories like âfoodâ or âfurnitureâ. Just throw it all into the same graph.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note also that you can have several edges between the same pair of nodes. You can keep track of the individual edges, or you can simply add them up. (Using the credit card, you spent a total of $13 on food.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Accounts have balances&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Every node in this graph is an account in accountant-speak (whether or not it is held by a bank), and every account has a balance. The balance is a single number for each account, and it is determined completely by the transactions in and out of the account:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;At the beginning of time, the value at each node is zero.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;At each node, for each incoming edge, add the edgeâs label to the nodeâs value; for each outgoing edge, subtract the edgeâs label from the value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After youâve processed all the edges, the value at each node is that accountâs balance. Our graph now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that the account balances have two nice properties:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Because every transaction appears twice â once positive and once negative â the sum of all account balances is always zero.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;If you partition the set of nodes into any two disjoint sets, and add up all of the balances in each set, then the sum for the one set is always the negative sum of the other set (because, after all, they have to add up to zero).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These properties are useful for sanity-checking your numbers; if they are violated, âur doin it wrongâ. (This is what accountants mean when they talk about âbalancing the booksâ.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Doing business&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Strengthened by a bagel and a burrito, you go out and talk to some potential customers. And hey, they love your product! It has a price tag of $5,000, and you sell it to two big enterprise customers. One pays you right away (good stuff!); the other gives you $2,500 up front, but insists that before they pay the rest, you need to implement that additional feature you foolishly promised.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So you received $5,000 + $2,500 in cash from your customers, wired straight the company bank account. Letâs add that to the graph:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But thatâs not quite right. The price was $5,000 for each customer, and now it looks like you charged two different prices. How do we represent our arrangement with customer 2?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The solution is to deconstruct the deal into two separate transactions: the sale (in which the buyer agrees to buy, but no actual money changes hands) and the payment (when the cash actually hits your bank account). We can draw it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;See what Iâve done here? Iâve just made up a new node, generically called it âsalesâ, and added the actual $5,000 sales as a transaction from this âsalesâ account to the customer accounts. Adding this extra node hasnât changed your bank balance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This makes sense when you think about the intuitive meaning of the balances. The balance of each customerâs account is the amount they owe you: customer 1 has fully paid up (their incoming and outgoing transactions add up to the same), so their balance is zero; customer 2 has contractually agreed to give you $5,000, but has so far only given you half of that, so their balance is $2,500.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And the balance on the sales account is the value of stuff youâve sold. Or rather, the negative value. That looks a bit weirdâ¦ but Iâll come back to that later. (BTW, if you wanted to separately track sales for different customers or different products, no problem â just add whatever nodes make sense for you. Just make sure that every transaction appears only once as an edge, otherwise youâre making stuff up!)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finishing off the example&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To round it off, let me add some more events to the story (= some more edges to the graph).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not only have you made some sales, but now you also receive a $20,000 investment from Y Combinator â congratulations! You and your co-founder can now afford to pay yourselves a salary. You take $8,000 out of the company account.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Then you get set up with a company accountant, and they talk lots of jargon at you. For some strange reason they are obsessed with correctly accounting for your office chair; they want it to depreciate over four years, i.e. its value is gradually reduced to zero over the course of that time. Fair enough, you say (even though you couldnât care less what your chair will be worth in four yearsâ time â surely by that time youâll be the next Google or Facebook, and youâll have other things to worry about than chairs).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The resulting graph now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note how I have represented the transactions:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;I have lumped together your founder investment with that of Y Combinator, under the heading of âcapitalâ. Put simply, this is money you got into the company by selling your companyâs shares, rather than by selling a product or service to a customer. As usual, you can split founders and YC into separate accounts if you feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Iâve represented payroll (salaries) as just money straight out of the bank account. In reality itâs a bit more complicated due to taxes, healthcare, benefits, etc. but the principles stay the same. Itâs just more nodes and edges in the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;I made depreciation for one year (one quarter of $500 = $125) go away from the âfurnitureâ account. Intuitively, this means that the balance of the âfurnitureâ account is the value that your furniture still has now. Each year, you add another $125 edge from âfurnitureâ to âdepreciationâ, until after four years, the balance of âfurnitureâ drops to zero (assuming you havenât bought any more chairs in the meantime, in your quest for world domination).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The profit and loss statement&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this point, if youâre getting weary, I donât blame you. But the good news: weâve finished building our graph! Now I will show you how this graph representation maps to two standard financial statements most commonly used in managing a company: the profit and loss statement (âP&amp;amp;Lâ), and the balance sheet. This is useful, because as a startup founder youâll sooner or later have to discuss these documents with your investors/advisors, and so you might as well learn what the hell they mean.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In order to produce these statements, I need to get out the crayons. Here is the same graph as before, with the nodes coloured in:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Explaining the colours (putting the accounting terminology in brackets, since youâre likely to encounter these words):&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Green for stuff that you have (âassetsâ), e.g. money in the bank, or things which you bought and you could sell again, such as furniture. Also green for people/companies who owe you money (âdebtorsâ, such as Customer 2), and people/companies to whom you owe money (âliabilitiesâ/âcreditorsâ, such as your upcoming credit card bill for that burrito).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Blue for sales of your product/service (ârevenueâ) and money you spent that youâre not going to get back (âexpensesâ/âoverheadsâ). The office chair is green, because you could sell it again if you wanted to, but the bagel is blue, because once youâve bought (and eaten) the bagel, thatâs it â no going back.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Pink for money from investors (or yourself) that you got by selling shares (âcapitalâ). (If you get a bank loan, thatâs green, not pink, because you owe the bank to pay it back.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Every one of your nodes should fall into exactly one of these categories. If not, something has gone wrong, or you have discovered some bit of the accounting world that I donât yet know about.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With these colours set, the profit and loss statement is simply a list of all the blue nodes, and the profit or loss of the company is the sum of all of the blue nodesâ balances. The way weâve calculated things, a negative value is a profit, and a positive value is a loss. Thatâs confusing, so you typically flip the sign when reporting the number (so that a profit is positive).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Written in the standard way, our P&amp;amp;L looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell rowspan="2" style="font-variant: small-caps;" role="head"&gt;Revenue&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888;"&gt;Sales&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; text-align: right;"&gt;$10,000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888;" role="head"&gt;Total revenue&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; text-align: right;" role="head"&gt;$10,000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;
          &lt;cell rowspan="4" style="font-variant: small-caps;" role="head"&gt;Expenses&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;Payroll&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="text-align: right;"&gt;$8,000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;Depreciation&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="text-align: right;"&gt;$125&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888;"&gt;Food&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; text-align: right;"&gt;$13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888;" role="head"&gt;Total expenses&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; text-align: right;" role="head"&gt;$8,138&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;
          &lt;cell style="padding-top: 1em; font-variant: small-caps;" role="head"&gt;Total&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; font-weight: bold;" role="head"&gt;Profit/Loss&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; font-weight: bold; text-align: right;" role="head"&gt;$1,862&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;(= total revenue - total expenses)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The meaning is fairly intuitive. You sold $10,000 worth of stuff, and spent only $8,138 in the process, so you made $1,862 profit.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The profit and loss statement is calculated over a period of time (usually a month, a quarter or a year), and itâs often interesting to compare two different periods. To calculate it for a period, filter your transactions to only include those which occurred within that period, and add up the account balances for just those transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One thing to watch out for: profit doesnât say anything about your bank account. The bank account is a green node, but weâre only looking at blue nodes here. In this example, you ended up with $23,995 in the bank, even though investors put in $25,000: you made a profit, yet still have less money in the bank than you did before, because Customer 2 hasnât yet fully paid. Thatâs why itâs possible for a company to be profitable but still run out of money!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Balance Sheet&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The balance sheet is a bit less intuitive than the P&amp;amp;L, but itâs quite a powerful document. It summarises what the company currently has and doesnât have, and why.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember what I said earlier about partitioning the nodes into two disjoint sets, and their summed balances adding to zero? Thatâs exactly what happens on the balance sheet. We take all of the nodes in the graph; on the one side we consider all of the green nodes, and on the other side all the blue and pink nodes. The sum of all of the blue and pink nodesâ balances is minus the sum of all of the green nodesâ balances.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now, by convention, accountants flip the sign on all of the blue and pink nodesâ balances, which means that the two sums end up being equal. And thatâs why itâs called a balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In our example, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell rowspan="4" style="font-variant: small-caps;" role="head"&gt;Assets&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;Bank account&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="text-align: right;"&gt;$23,995&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;Debtors&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="text-align: right;"&gt;$2,500&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888;"&gt;Furniture&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; text-align: right;"&gt;$375&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888;" role="head"&gt;Total assets&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; text-align: right;" role="head"&gt;$26,870&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;
          &lt;cell rowspan="2" style="font-variant: small-caps;" role="head"&gt;Liabilities&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888;"&gt;Credit card&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; text-align: right;"&gt;$8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888;" role="head"&gt;Total liabilities&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; text-align: right;" role="head"&gt;$8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell colspan="2" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; font-weight: bold;" role="head"&gt;Total assets less total liabilities&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; font-weight: bold; text-align: right;" role="head"&gt;$26,862&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;
          &lt;cell rowspan="3" style="padding-top: 1em; font-variant: small-caps;" role="head"&gt;Equity&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;Profit/Loss&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="text-align: right;"&gt;$1,862&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888;"&gt;Capital&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; text-align: right;"&gt;$25,000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; font-weight: bold;" role="head"&gt;Total equity&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell style="border-bottom: 1px solid #888; font-weight: bold; text-align: right;" role="head"&gt;$26,862&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The top block (assets and liabilities) corresponds to the green nodes in the graph, whilst the bottom block contains the pink node (capital) and the sum of all of the blue nodes. We already showed all of the detail for the blue nodes on the Profit and Loss statement above; on the balance sheet we can sum them all up to a single number.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some more sign-flipping has occurred here: Iâve written liabilities, equity and P&amp;amp;L with their signs flipped (which usually, but not always, has the effect of making the numbers positive). That doesnât change anything fundamental about the graph structure, it just puts things into the conventional schema.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So how can you interpret the balance sheet? There are various things you can read from it. You can see how much money is in the bank, and how much of that money has already been promised to other people (liabilities). You can see how much of the money in the bank came from investors, vs. how much came from sales. And it shows how much money is due to come in soon, from sales that have closed but havenât yet been fully paid.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The total of the balance sheet is a lower bound on the value of your company. Itâs a very pessimistic figure â it assumes that your team, your technology, your brand etc. are all worth precisely nothing; if your company raises money from investors, your valuation will be much higher than the balance sheet figure, since that valuation includes the value of team, technology, brand etc in the form of a wild guess. In established companies you can find âintangible assetsâ on the balance sheet, but since they are very hard to value, I suspect itâs not worth bothering with unless you know what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It all started with cold calling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our new "AI/ML Product Management" class, the "pre-case" submissions (short assignments meant to prepare students for class discussion) were looking suspiciously good. Not "strong student" good. More like "this reads like a McKinsey memo that went through three rounds of editing," good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we started cold calling students randomly during class.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result was... illuminating. Many students who had submitted thoughtful, well-structured work could not explain basic choices in their own submission after two follow-up questions. Some could not participate at all. This gap was too consistent to blame on nerves or bad luck. If you cannot defend your own work live, then the written artifact is not measuring what you think it is measuring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brian Jabarian has been doing interesting work on this problem, and his results both inspired us and gave us the confidence to try something that would have sounded absurd two years ago: running the final exam with a Voice AI agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why oral exams? And why now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core problem is simple: students have immediate access to LLMs that can handle most exam questions we traditionally use for assessment. The old equilibrium, where take-home work could reliably measure understanding, is dead. Gone. Kaput.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oral exams are a natural response. They force real-time reasoning, application to novel prompts, and defense of actual decisions. The problem? Oral exams are a logistical nightmare. You cannot run them for a large class without turning the final exam period into a month-long hostage situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless you cheat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enter the Voice Agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used ElevenLabs Conversational AI to build the examiner. The platform bundles the messy parts (speech-to-text, text-to-speech, turn-taking, interruption handling, …) into something usable. And here is the thing that surprised me: a basic version for a low-stakes setting (e.g., an assignment) can be up and running in literally minutes. Minutes. Just write a prompt describing what the agent should ask the student, and you are done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two features mattered a lot for our setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dynamic variables: pass the student's name, project details, and other per-student context into the conversation as parameters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Workflows: build a structured flow with sub-agents instead of a single "chatty" agent trying to do everything&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the exam looked like&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ran a two-part oral exam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part 1: "Talk me through your project." The agent asks about the student's capstone project: goals, data, modeling choices, evaluation, failure modes. This is where the "LLM did my homework" strategy dies. You can paste an assignment into ChatGPT. It is much harder to improvise consistent answers about specific decisions when someone is drilling into details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part 2: "Now do a case." The agent picks one of the cases we discussed in class and asks questions spanning the topics we covered: basically testing whether students absorbed the material or just showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To handle this structure, we split the exam into sub-agents in a workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Authentication agent: Asks for the student's ID and refuses to proceed without a valid one. (In a more productized version, we would integrate with NYU SSO instead of checking against a list.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Project discussion agent: Gets project context injected via parameters. The prompt includes details of each project so the agent can ask informed questions. The next step is obvious: connect retrieval over the student's submitted slides and reports so the agent can quote and probe precisely.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Case discussion agent: Selects a case and runs structured questioning. Again, RAG would help with richer case details.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This "many small agents" approach is not just aesthetic. It prevents the system from drifting into unbounded conversation, and it makes debugging possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;By the Numbers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;36 students examined over 9 days&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;25 minutes average (range: 9–64)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;65 messages per conversation on average&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;0.42 USD per student (15 USD total)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;89% of LLM grades within 1 point&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shortest exam (9 min) → highest score (19/20)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The economics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's talk money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total cost for 36 students: 15 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's 8 USD for Claude (the chair and heaviest grader), 2 USD for Gemini, 0.30 USD for OpenAI, and roughly 5 USD for ElevenLabs voice minutes. Forty-two cents per student.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternative? 36 students × 25-minute exam × 2 graders = 30 hours of human time. At TA rates (~25/hour), that's 750. At faculty rates, it's "we don't do oral exams because they don't scale."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 15 dollars, we got: real-time oral examination, a three-model grading council with deliberation, structured feedback with verbatim quotes, a complete audit trail, and—as you'll see—a diagnosis of our own teaching gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The unit economics in terms of cost work. We will see next that the real benefit is in the value that is delivered, not in the 50x cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What broke (and how we fixed it)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first version had problems. Here is what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1) The voice was intimidating&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few students complained that the agent sounded severe. We had cloned Foster Provost's voice because, frankly, his clone was much more accurate than the clones of our own voices. But the students found it... intense. Here is an email from a student:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I had prepared thoroughly and felt confident in my understanding of the material, but the intensity of the interviewer's voice during the exam unexpectedly heightened my anxiety and affected my performance. The experience was more triggering than I anticipated, which made it difficult to fully demonstrate my knowledge. Throughout the course, I have actively participated and engaged with the material, and I had hoped to better demonstrate my knowledge in this interview.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is another:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Just got done with my oral exam. [...] I honestly didn't feel comfortable with it at all. The voice you picked was so condescending that it actually dropped my confidence. [...] I don't know why but the agent was shouting at me.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix: We are split on that. We love FakeFoster. But next time we will A/B test, and we will try to test other voices. At the end of the day, we want to optimize for comprehension, not charisma. ElevenLabs has guidance on voice and personality tuning: they treat this as a product design problem, and probably a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2) The agent stacked questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the biggest real issue. The agent would ask something like: "Explain your metric choice, and also tell me what baselines you tried, and why you did not use X, and what you would do next."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is not one question. That is four questions wearing a trench coat. The cognitive load for an oral exam is already high. Stacking questions makes it brutal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix: Hard rule in the prompt: one question at a time. If you want multi-part probing, chain it across turns. For grading the exam, we included an "interference protocol": students received full credit if they had questions stacked like that and answered only some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3) Clarifications became moving targets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Student: "Can you repeat the question?"&lt;lb/&gt; Agent: paraphrases the question in a subtly different way&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the student is solving a different problem than the one they were asked. Very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix: Explicit instruction in the prompt: repeat verbatim when asked to repeat. No paraphrasing. Same words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4) The agent did not let students think&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans rush to fill silence. Agents do too. Students would pause to think, and the agent would jump in with follow-up probes or worse: interpret the silence as confusion and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix: Tell the agent to allow think-time without probing aggressively. It made the exam feel less like an interrogation. We also increased the time-out before the agent asks "Are you there?" from 5 to 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;5) Lack of randomization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We asked the agent to "randomly select" a case study. It did not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From December 12–18, when Zillow was in the case list, the agent picked Zillow 88% of the time. After we removed Zillow from the prompt on December 18, the agent immediately latched onto Predictive Policing—picking it for 16 out of 21 exams on December 19 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are not random. They have implicit preferences and ordering biases. Asking an LLM to "pick randomly" is like asking a human to "think of a number between 1 and 10"—you're going to get a lot of 7s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix: Pass an explicit random number as a parameter and map it to cases deterministically. Do the randomization in code, not in the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Grading: the council deliberation actually worked&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, so here is where things got interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We graded using a "council of LLMs" approach, an idea we borrowed from Andrej Karpathy. Three models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) assessed each transcript independently. Then they saw each other's assessments and revised. Finally, the chair (Claude) synthesized the final grade with evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Round 1 was a mess. When the models graded independently, agreement was poor: 0% of grades matched exactly, and only 23% were within 2 points. The average maximum disagreement was nearly 4 points on a 20-point scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's the kicker: Gemini was a softie: It averaged 17/20. Claude averaged 13.4/20. That's a 3.6-point gap—the difference between a B+ and a B-.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Claude and OpenAI were already aligned: 70% of their grades were within 1 point of each other in Round 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Model&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Round 1 Mean&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Round 2 Mean&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Change&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13.4/20&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13.9/20&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+0.5&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;OpenAI&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14.0/20&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14.0/20&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+0.0&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Gemini&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17.0/20&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15.0/20&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-2.0&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then came consultation. After each model saw the others' assessments and evidence, agreement improved dramatically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Metric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Round 1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Round 2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Improvement&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Perfect agreement&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;21%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+21 pp&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Within 1 point&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;62%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+62 pp&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Within 2 points&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;23%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;85%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+62 pp&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Mean max difference&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3.93 pts&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.41 pts&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-2.52 pts&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini lowered its grades by an average of 2 points after seeing Claude's and OpenAI's more rigorous assessments. It couldn't justify giving 17s when Claude was pointing to specific gaps in the experimentation discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's what's interesting: the disagreement wasn't random. Problem Framing and Metrics had 100% agreement within 1 point. Experimentation? Only 57%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? When students give clear, specific answers, graders agree. When students give vague hand-wavy answers, graders (human or AI) disagree on how much partial credit to give. The low agreement on experimentation reflects genuine ambiguity in student responses, not grader noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The grading was stricter than my own default. That's not a bug. Students will be evaluated outside the university, and the world is not known for grade inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feedback was better than any human would produce. The system generated structured "strengths / weaknesses / actions" summaries with verbatim quotes from the transcript. Sample feedback from the highest scorer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"Your understanding of metric trade-offs and Goodhart's Law risks was exceptional—the hot tub example perfectly illustrated how optimizing for one metric can corrupt another."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sample from a B- student:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"Practice articulating complete A/B testing designs: state a hypothesis, define randomization unit, specify guardrail metrics, and establish decision criteria for shipping or rolling back."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specific. Actionable. Tied to evidence. No human grader has the time to generate that for every student.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It diagnosed our teaching gaps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ha! This one stung.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we analyzed performance by topic, one bar stuck out like a sore thumb: Experimentation. Mean score: 1.94 out of 4. Compare that to Problem Framing at 3.39.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The breakdown was brutal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3 students (8%) scored 0—couldn't discuss it at all&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;7 students (19%) scored 1—superficial understanding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;15 students (42%) scored 2—basic understanding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;0 students scored 4—no one demonstrated mastery&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had rushed through A/B testing methodology in class. The external grader made it impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The grading output became a mirror reflecting our own weaknesses as instructors. Ooof.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Duration ≠ Quality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One finding I found strangely fascinating: exam duration had zero correlation with score (r = -0.03). The shortest exam—9 minutes—got the highest score (19/20). The longest—64 minutes—scored 12/20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking longer doesn't mean you know more. If anything, it signals struggling to articulate. Confidence is efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Anti-cheating (or: trust but verify)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We asked students to record themselves while taking the exam (webcam + audio). This discourages blatantly outsourcing the conversation, having multiple people in the room, or having an LLM in voice mode whispering answers. It also gives us a backup record in case something goes really badly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is an underrated benefit of this whole setup: the exam is powered by guidelines, not by secret questions. We can publish exactly how the exam works—the structure, the skills being tested, the types of questions. No surprises. The LLM will pick the specific questions live, and the student will have to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reduces anxiety and pushes students toward actual preparation instead of guessing what the instructor "wants." And it eliminates the leaked-exam problem entirely. Practice all you want—it will only make you better prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the students said&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We surveyed students before releasing grades to capture their experience. Some of the results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only 13% preferred the AI oral format. 57% wanted traditional written exams. 83% found it more stressful.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;But here's the thing: 70% agreed it tested their actual understanding: the highest-rated item. They accepted the assessment but not the delivery.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At the same time, they almost universally liked the flexibility of taking the exam at their own place and time. Yes, many of them would have also preferred a take-home exam instead of the oral exam, but this format is dead now.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;83% of students found the oral exam framework more stressful than a written exam.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The fix is clear: one question at a time, slower pacing, calmer tone. The concept works. The execution needs iteration.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Try it yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to experiment with this approach, here are some resources:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prompt for the voice agent&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prompt for the grading council&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Link to try the voice agent (use Konstantinos as the name and kr888 as the net id to authenticate; the project was a "LinkedIn Recruiter, an agent that scans profiles and automatically sends personalized DMs to candidates on behalf of a recruiter. It engages in the first 3 turns of chat to answer basic questions (salary, location) before handing off to a human.")&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I would change next time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slower pacing and a calmer voice: We love you FakeFoster, but GenZ is not ready for you. Perhaps we will deploy FakePanos next time. Too bad ElevenLabs hasn't perfected thick accents yet to deliver a real Panos experience.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAG over student artifacts (slides, reports, notebooks). ElevenLabs supports this directly. If the agent can quote the student's own submission, the exam becomes much harder to game and much more diagnostically useful.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better case randomization with explicit seeding and tracking. Randomness that "feels random" is not enough. Pass explicit parameters.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit triggers in grading. If the LLM committee disagrees beyond a threshold, flag for human review. The point of a committee is not to pretend the result is always certain; it is to surface uncertainty.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accessibility defaults. Offer practice runs, allow extra time, and provide alternatives when voice interaction creates unnecessary barriers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The bigger point&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take-home exams are dead. Reverting to pen-and-paper exams in the classroom feels like a regression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need assessments that evolve towards formats that reward understanding, decision-making, and real-time reasoning. Oral exams used to be standard until they could not scale. Now, AI is making them scalable again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is the delicious part: you can give the whole setup to the students and let them prepare for the exam by practicing it multiple times. Unlike traditional exams, where leaked questions are a disaster, here the questions are generated fresh each time. The more you practice, the better you get. That is... actually how learning is supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fight fire with fire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Brian Jabarian for the inspiration and for giving us confidence that these interviews will work, Foster Provost for lending his voice to create the FakeFoster agent (sorry, students found you intimidating!), and Andrej Karpathy for the council-of-LLMs idea.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Layer Inference: Supports sequential layer processing with double-buffered activations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a minimal, educational-scale TPU designed for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Small-scale ML inference (2×2 matrices)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For production workloads, scale up the array size (e.g., 256×256 like Google TPU v1).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The project includes a Python driver for communicating with the FPGA:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd host

# Basic inference demo
python3 inference_demo.py

# Gesture recognition demo (requires trained model)
python3 gesture_demo.py

# Interactive test
python3 test_tpu_driver.py&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;inference_demo.py&lt;/code&gt; script demonstrates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Loading weights into the TPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Loading input activations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Executing inference&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading results&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example Usage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from tpu_driver import TPUDriver

# Connect to FPGA (adjust port as needed)
tpu = TPUDriver('/dev/ttyUSB0')  # Linux
# tpu = TPUDriver('COM3')         # Windows

# Load 2×2 weight matrix
weights = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
tpu.write_weights(weights)

# Load 2×2 activation matrix
activations = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
tpu.write_activations(activations)

# Execute inference
tpu.execute()

# Read results
result = tpu.read_result()
print(f"Result: {result}")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;gesture_demo.py&lt;/code&gt; script implements a simple gesture classifier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trains a 2-layer MLP on mouse movement data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Classifies gestures as "Horizontal" or "Vertical"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real-time inference on FPGA&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running the Demo:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd host
python3 gesture_demo.py&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Model Training:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd model
python3 train.py
# Generates: gesture_model.json&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TPU uses a simple byte-based UART protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x01&lt;/code&gt;: Write Weight (4 bytes: W00, W01, W10, W11)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x02&lt;/code&gt;: Write Activation (4 bytes: A00, A01, A10, A11)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x03&lt;/code&gt;: Execute (start inference)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x04&lt;/code&gt;: Read Result (returns 4 bytes: acc0[31:0])&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x05&lt;/code&gt;: Read Result Column 1 (returns 4 bytes: acc1[31:0])&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x06&lt;/code&gt;: Read Status (returns 1 byte: state[3:0] | cycle_cnt[3:0])&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See &lt;code&gt;host/tpu_driver.py&lt;/code&gt; for full protocol implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Yosys synthesis works well for most SystemVerilog constructs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;nextpnr supports Xilinx 7-series but may have timing/routing challenges&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bitstream generation (fasm2bit) may require Xilinx tools or open-source alternatives&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For development: Use Vivado for reliable builds&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For open-source exploration: Use Yosys for synthesis, verify with Vivado&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For production: Stick with Vivado until open-source toolchain matures&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Future Work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create automated Yosys/nextpnr build script&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Document fasm2bit conversion process&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Benchmark open-source vs. Vivado results&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verilator Errors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ensure Verilator 5.022+ is installed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check SystemVerilog syntax (use &lt;code&gt;make lint&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Test Failures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run with &lt;code&gt;WAVES=1&lt;/code&gt;to generate waveforms for debugging&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check &lt;code&gt;sim/test_output.log&lt;/code&gt;for detailed error messages&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthesis Errors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check RTL files are in &lt;code&gt;rtl/&lt;/code&gt;directory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify SystemVerilog syntax (Vivado may be stricter than Verilator)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Timing Violations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check &lt;code&gt;timing_summary_post_impl.rpt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;May need to add pipeline stages or reduce clock frequency&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Place &amp;amp; Route Failures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check utilization reports&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify constraints in &lt;code&gt;basys3.xdc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UART Not Working:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify COM port: &lt;code&gt;ls /dev/ttyUSB*&lt;/code&gt;(Linux) or Device Manager (Windows)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check baud rate: 115200&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify TX/RX pins in constraints file&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LEDs Not Responding:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check bitstream programmed correctly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify reset button (center button)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check switch settings for LED modes (see &lt;code&gt;fpga/README.md&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;POSSE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;POSSE is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third parties (like social media silos) with original post links to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ watch Zach’s 1min* video intro to POSSE&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let your friends read your posts, their way. POSSE lets your friends keep using whatever they use to read your stuff (e.g. social media silos like Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, Neocities, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay in touch with friends now, not some theoretical future. POSSE is about staying in touch with current friends now, rather than the potential of staying in touch with friends in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Friends are more important than federation. By focusing on relationships that matter to people rather than architectural ideals, from a human perspective, POSSE is more important than federation. Additionally, if federated approaches take a POSSE approach first, they will likely get better adoption (everyone wants to stay in touch with their friends), and thereby more rapidly approach that federated future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;POSSE is beyond blogging. It's a key part of why and how the IndieWeb movement is different from just "everyone blog on their own site", and also different from "everyone just install and run (YourFavoriteSocialSoftware)" etc. monoculture solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why In General&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;POSSE is considered a robust and preferable syndication model for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce 3rd party dependence. By posting directly to your own site, you're not dependent on 3rd Party services to do so -- if you can access your site, you can publish your content. On the contrary with PESOS, when the 3rd party site is down, you are unable to add content.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ownership. By posting first on your own site, you create a direct ownership chain that can be traced back to you without any intervening 3rd party services (silos) TOS's getting in the way (which is a vulnerability of PESOS).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Own canonical URLs to your content. Canonical URLs to your content are on your domain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copies can cite the original. By posting content first to your own site (and thus creating a permalink for it), copies that you post on 3rd Party services can link or cite the original on your site (see syndication_formats and POSSE Notes to Twitter)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better search. Searching public content on your own domain (with any web search engine of your choice) works better than depending on silos exclusively to search your posts (e.g. Twitter for a while only showed recent tweets in search results. Facebook still has very poor search results).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;backfeed can be used to pull in (reverse syndicate) responses from other services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;allows taking advantage of other services' social layers and aggregation features while storing the canonical copy of your content on your own site&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Link To Your Original&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Common POSSE practice is to link from POSSE copies to your original, using a permashortlink. Here are a few reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discovery of your original content. discovery of your original content from the copies on 3rd party services is enabled by the permashortlinks to your originals posted on said services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Subvert spammers who copy your posts. When spammers (e.g. @sin3rss) mindlessly copy from your POSSE copies and repost, they also copy the link back to the original, and thus provide more distribution for people to find and view your original post. "2011-01-09 internet aikido" of a sort.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better ranking for your original posts. If/when your POSSE copies are themselves copied by others and (re)posted elsewhere (e.g. manual retweets, RSS bots etc.), when the copies link to your original posts, search engines figure that out by following those links back to the original and ranking it higher.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How to implement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section is for web developers implementing POSSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;In General&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, when your content posting software posts something, it should also post a copy to the silo destinations of your choice, with an original post link (e.g. permashortlink or permashortcitation) back to your original.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The details of how to do so vary per destination. See the silo-specific sections below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have posted the copy to the silo, you should:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;link to the syndicated copy from the original in a posts-elsewhere section on your post.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;User Interface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best user interface (UI) is automatic, dependable, and invisible. If you can implement POSSEing in a way that always does exactly what you want, predictably, then no explicit UI is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Preview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to provide more predictability and inspire confidence is to show what will be POSSEd (within the limitations of the destination) as a preview before publishing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(needs screenshot)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twitter is perhaps the most popular POSSE destination and a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can start posting notes (tweets) to your own site and POSSEing to Twitter, instead of posting directly to Twitter, you have taken a big step towards owning your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;API Access - posting new tweets works nicely due to permanent API tokens, and the return value contains a URL to the posted &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;As of 2022-11, Twitter is rejecting new API access for applications used to POSSE/backfeed on the grounds that they may violate twitter’s rules and/or policies — Barnaby Walters&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supports very complete web action endpoints, so semi-manual posting is easy to implement &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;What are these endpoints? Is this still the case in 2022? — Barnaby Walters&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See POSSE to Twitter for details on how to POSSE both notes and articles (blog posts) to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two options for POSSEing to Facebook currently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manually crosspost&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Semi-automatically with the Bridgy browser extension for Facebook&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Medium&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can create posts via the posts API&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Medium also supports manual POSSE via the Import Post function, which preserves rel-canonical links to the original URL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shane Becker and Ben Werdmüller manually POSSE to Medium&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chris Aldrich uses the WordPress Medium Plugin to POSSE to Medium. They also support bulk migration (aka mass POSSE) for porting across lots of posts after which posts can be POSSEd by means of their plugin.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aaron Gustafson Wrote a Jekyll plugin to POSSE to Medium.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;WordPress&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How does veganstraightedge.com do it? (all his articles are manually POSSEd to WordPress.com)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chris Aldrich uses a WordPress plugin WordPress Crosspost to POSSE from a self-hosted WordPress install to WordPress.com.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plain Text Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some destinations (e.g. SMS or push notifications) may require a pure plain text representation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;h-entry_to_text is a method of generating a plain text representation from an arbitrary h-entry&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software and libraries to implement POSSE:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PHP &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The POSSE namespace in php-helpers (might be moved to a separate package) contains various truncation, preparation and syndication functions including HTML =&amp;gt; plaintext µblog syntax converter&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;SiloRider is a command-line tool, implemented in Python, that lets you implement POSSE to various services (Twitter and Mastodon as of 2018-08-01).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Feed2Toot is another command-line python tool that parses any number of RSS feeds and posts their content on ActivityPub based services (tested with: Mastodon, Pleroma). Contains some neat bells and whistles like advanced post filtering, numerous options for feed parsing and toot formatting.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Docker &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;POSSE Party: self-hosted software for POSSE&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Services&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bridgy Publish is POSSE-as-a-service. It supports Twitter, Flickr, GitHub and Mastodon. You can use it interactively or programmatically via webmention.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mugged Tweets - will POSSE a note to a mug (may require first POSSEing to Twitter)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IFTTT allows automatically reposting content with an RSS or Atom feed to a number of silos incuding Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EchoFeed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Publishing Flows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's at least two ways to implement a POSSE content posting flow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Client to site to silo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Optional: client provides UI for selecting which 3rd party services to push to if it knows about them, with optional customizations for per service&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having finished the content, the user publishes content to their server (optionally: with metadata of which 3rd party services and any customizations thereof) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Optional: client can generate a permalink knowing the state of the server, and publish to that permalink&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The server publishes the content, generates a permalink and summary (and/or customized content suited to 3rd party services) if necessary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The server posts copies with permalinks to 3rd party services&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User only has to interact with one site over the internet, their own&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Syndication can be done fully automatically by the server&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;any?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Client to site and silo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having finished the content, the user publishes it to their server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The client queries the server for the URL of the content it just pushed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The publishing client presents the user with an interface for selecting: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Which 3rd party services to publish to&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The exact content published to the services, pre-filled with a summary based on the produced content&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The user selects the services and submits the form&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The publishing client posts the content summaries out to the 3rd party services&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More user control over timing and editing of copies of content to 3rd party services&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Syndication requires a manual step each time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dependent on client connectivity directly to 3rd party services (problematic in flakey mobile situations, or when client is publishing using domain-censored internet access).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;IndieWeb Examples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following IndieWebCamp participants' sites support a POSSE architecture. If you have an implementation, add it, make screenshots or a screencast or blog about it and post the details/link here. In date order (earliest first) :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tantek&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tantek.com as of 2010-01-01[1] (2010-01-26 Twitter syndication started[2] and caught up[3][4]). Tantek Çelik implemented POSSE in Falcon on tantek.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;all self-hosted posts are openly with PuSH v0.4 + h-feed and Atom real-time syndicated with a PubsubHubbub hub to StatusNet, other subscribers etc. (also to Google Buzz til it shutdown)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;note (and article titles), reply, RSVP posts are snowflake copied by the personal site server to Twitter with permashortlink citation links/references (see Whistle for details) back to the original. Copies of notes to Twitter are also automatically recopied from there to Facebook.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;likes of tweets are "copied" (more like propagated) to Twitter using Bridgy publish&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;User:Sandeep.io First post POSSE'd on 2012-11-05. I primarily syndicate to Twitter using a very lo-fi solution of adding silo (Facebook, Twiiter, Google+) provided share links to each post that I can manually click to prefill content, edit and post. I've avoided API integration because of the extensive experience I've had using Facebook API and dealing with it's random changes. "Integration" has high costs sometimes so I keep it as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;werd.io as of 2013-05-31 [9]. Ben Werdmuller implemented POSSE in his idno platform via plugins. New content has an associated Activity Streams object type; POSSE plugins listen for post events associated with those object types and syndicate appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Notes and articles are syndicated to Twitter and Facebook&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Images are syndicated to Facebook, Flickr and Twitter&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Places are syndicated to Foursquare&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More plugins are very easily possible; the Foursquare plugin took about an hour to build&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Partial POSSE sites&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sites which only POSSE some of their content, and still post directly to the same silo they POSSE to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other partial POSSE sites:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User:Hupili.net implements a partial POSSE with the following setups: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;SNSAPI is a lightweight middleware to unify the data structure and interfaces of different social networking services. It gives the scripting flexibility for developer users to manipulate social silos.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;SNSRouter is a web UI built upon SNSAPI where one can read an aggregated timeline from different sites, mass forward messages, and update statuses on all channels.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;As is said in one of the description paragraph above, this model is not truly POSSE. One can not (hardly) distinguish original/ syndicated status. I'm planning to put a page with permlink on my site upon each status update and then use SNSAPI to syndicate to other silos.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other Approaches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;COPE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;COPE is short for Create Once, Publish Everywhere (COPE), which explicitly lacks a first "Publish Once" step, and thus is more about duplicating the content across various destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without a first "Publish Once" step on a site you "Own", and thus lacking original post permalinks, the COPE strategy fails to actually draw people to any one canonical place to read/view your stuff, and thus all it does is grow (likely) disjoint audiences across other people’s sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Articles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2009-10-13 COPE: Create Once, Publish Everywhere by Daniel Jacobson, Director of Application Development for NPR. (Original https://www.programmableweb.com/news/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/2009/10/13 offline due to site-death of programmableweb.com in 2022)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2019-10-28 Create Once, Publish Everywhere With WordPress by Leonardo Losovitz in Smashing Magazine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2019 WordCamp Taipei talk: Create Once, Publish Everywhere video on WordPress.tv&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;POSE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;POSE, Publish Once Syndicate Everywhere, was a broader predecessor of POSSE that also included publishing once on one particular silo, and then syndicating out to other silos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;PESOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar but opposite approach is PESOS where content is posted first to 3rd party services and then copied/syndicated into a personal site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If exact copies of content are posted on both a personal site and 3rd party services, there's no way to tell (short of comparing possibly non-existent sub-second accurate published dates) whether a site is using POSSE or PESOS. Sites can provably support POSSE by including perma(short)links in syndicated copies that link/reference back to published originals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;PESETAS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PESETAS is like PESOS but copying/syndicating everything to a particular silo (without any involvement of a personal site).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, most silos support cross-posting to Twitter, thus you could connect everything to your Twitter account and always (auto-)cross-post there to keep a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E.g. Tumblr has a UI for cross-posting to Twitter. See Webapps StackExchange post for documentation and screenshots of UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tumblr is a better PESETAS destination however, since it is well established, allows for a wider variety of content, and allows more text, and links to URLs directly instead of linkwrapping them like Twitter does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Brainstorming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;CRUD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the above, and to date (2013-222), POSSE has solely described syndicating the Creation of content on your site (publishing) to other sites. This model has been quite successful and perhaps may be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it is worth exploring the potential utility of a full CRUD protocol for POSSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Create&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create is the POSSE default. You create content on your site, you POSSE your creates to other sites. All of this is described above, and in silo-specific details on silo pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Read&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read as a verb is interesting when applied to POSSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a minimum, it's useful to implement storing links to syndicated copies of your content to provide for the future possibility of reading from downstream POSSE copies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;u-syndication for how to markup links to syndicated copies of your content&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;syndication-link-use-cases for why to do so&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actual direct uses of Reading from downstream POSSE copies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reverse-syndication / backfeed of activity around the POSSE copy onto your original:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, keeping a u-syndication link to the POSSE copy enables deleting it to perform an Update or a Delete action, as described in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a POSSE destination allows updates/edits, then when you edit your post, you could propagate that update to the downstream POSSE copy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;E.g. Facebook allows editing the text of a post (including any links in the text), person tags, but not the image of a photo post&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the destination disallows updates/edits, like Twitter, it is still possible to virtually POSSE updates by deleting the POSSE tweet and reposting, i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider only POSSEing updates to Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if no one has replied to it yet (otherwise you'd break a threaded conversation on Twitter)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if your changes would be shown in the truncated copy on Twitter (i.e. if your changes are past the 140 (more like 120) character horizon, no point in churning the Twitter copy).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;within a very short time window, maybe like 2-5 minutes, because otherwise the update will be seen as a duplicate to people who are reading you on Twitter.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these concerns are regarding the experience that you provide to your friends reading your tweets on Twitter, which of course should be the whole (design) reason you're bothering to POSSE to Twitter in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For details, see silo-specific POSSE sections:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Facebook: POSSE to Facebook (to-do: needs details re: edit text ok, but no photo editing, photo posts need delete/repost to simulate POSSE update)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flickr: (UI supports manually updating the image of a photo post, but is that available in the API? and if so, file a Bridgy Publish feature request GitHub issue to support POSSE Update to Flickr (including the image of a photo post)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Twitter: POSSE to Twitter (to-do: copy the above delete/repost strategy to there)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Delete&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deletes seem fairly straightforward to POSSE, especially to services which themselves propagate deletes to clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E.g. one can delete a note on Twitter at any point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to updates, consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if there are already replies to a POSSE copy (or activity like favorites/retweets), consider keeping it to keep conversation threading (and others' favorites/retweets).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if you really feel like deleting the content from your site and POSSE copies (e.g. on Twitter), go ahead and do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is an opportunity for the UI for the deletion of a post to check to see if there's been any activity (replies, favorites, retweets) on the POSSE copy before performing the delete. One possible implementation could involve the UI informing the user of this activity (or lack of it) and reconfirming the delete request on a per-service basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;IndieWeb Examples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grant Richmond supports POSSE deletes on twitter as of 2018-10-10, by checking if a post on his site has been unpublished / deleted and sending the appropriate api request for likes, reposts and notes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Worry about search engines and duplicates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Do we need to worry about search engines penalizing apparently duplicate posts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A: That's why the POSSE copies SHOULD always link back to the originals. So that search engines can infer that the copies are just copies. Ideally POSSE copies on silos should use rel-canonical to link back to the originals, but even without explicit rel-canonical, the explicit link back to the original is a strong hint that it is an original.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also an advantage of POSSE over PESOS. With PESOS - there's no way to tell what's the original and what's the copy - so they do look like duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;POSSE-post-discovery and backlinks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Brid.gy can use posse-post-discovery to find the relationship between a syndicated post and the original when there is not explicit link. Does this mean I should stop adding backlinks to syndicated copies?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A: POSSEing without a backlink is considered a last resort, and has some costs associated with it. See posse-post-discovery#Tradeoffs for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2010-05-26 POSSE first described online as a concept in Tantek Celik on DiSo 2.0: Down to Brass Tacks(archived monkinetic original) : &lt;p&gt;Publish on your own site, own your URLs, your permalinks, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Syndicate out to other sites. Your text updates to Twitter, your checkins to Foursquare, your photos to Flickr etc.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;sometime before 2014-06-21[11]: POSE (Publish Once Syndicate Everywhere) term defined at some point prior to POSSE. Conceptually it was looser than POSSE, as "once" could be interpreted as on a silo rather than your "own site", which POSSE (and the conceptual predecessors) made explicit.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; Ars Technica) How Google’s AMP project speeds up the Web—by sandblasting HTML (&lt;p&gt;[…] this nudges publishers toward an idea that's big in the IndieWeb movement: Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere (or POSSE for short).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to own the canonical copy of the content on your own site but then to send that content everywhere you can. Or rather, everywhere you want to reach your readers. Facebook Instant Article? Sure, hook up the RSS feed. Apple News? Send the feed over there, too. AMP? Sure, generate an AMP page. No need to stop there—tap the new Medium API and half a dozen others as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading is a fragmented experience. Some people will love reading on the Web, some via RSS in their favorite reader, some in Facebook Instant Articles, some via AMP pages on Twitter, some via Lynx in their terminal running on a restored TRS-80 (seriously, it can be done. See below). The beauty of the POSSE approach is that you can reach them all from a single, canonical source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Web's sake, let's hope Google sticks with AMP long enough to convince publishers that the real future is speeding up their own pages and embracing a POSSE-style approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;HN ibid: "Why won't a link on these platforms suffice since they have their "cards"?"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HN ibid: "This is an interesting thing, but too complicated and over-broad for the mere-mortal." &amp;lt;-- page introduction needs simplifying, simpler instructions to setup POSSE, acknowledge where POSSE usability is in the Generations spectrum&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HN ibid: "Facebook is just a glorified RSS feed with centralized discover ability." &amp;lt;-- debunk with comparing Facebook#Features (and Twitter#Features) vs RSS plumbing feature set. A visual diagram/table comparison might help.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HN ibid: "This really is not possible with RSS at all, especially since the silos don’t want to support RSS in any meaningful way." &amp;lt;-- perhaps add a whole subsection in "Why" explaining why RSS is insufficient compared to POSSE.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Recommend non-realtime POSSE to Twitter and other social media due to their active use as part of the surveillance apparatus of local and national law enforcement: https://theintercept.com/2020/07/09/twitter-dataminr-police-spy-surveillance-black-lives-matter-protests/&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jetpack 8.9 adds Social Previews which allows one to preview how your posts will appear on Facebook, Twitter, and Google search results before you hit the publish button!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consider a deliberate ethical use of POSSEing, e.g. see Code of Ethics for an example set of explicit self-stated “Rules of engagement”&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Cory Doctorow explains how he uses POSSE. This Week in Google (time offset 474s): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyU2cZLFsik&amp;amp;t=474s &lt;p&gt;I try not to get locked into anyone else’s walled garden.

      &lt;item&gt;"What Matthias said.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Brainstorm: Tantek Çelik: POSSE advantages are largely distribution (immediately) and discovery (over time). if neither of those two are happening, then it's not worth keeping it around. Date-time-proof-of-posting can be solved by sending your original post (or a POSSE/tweet copy) to the Internet Archive and does not require keeping the POSSE/tweet copy.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Why: 2023-07-13 Jeremy Keith: The syndicate &lt;p&gt;We’ll see how long it lasts. We’ll see how long any of them last. Today’s social media darlings are tomorrow’s Friendster and MySpace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the current crop of services wither and die, my own website will still remain in full bloom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;https://mastodon.social/@davidpierce/111284796654263440 &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;"For the last six months or so I've been obsessed with POSSE, a decade-old idea about how to mix the best of blogging and social media. For a story and for The Vergecast, I tried to figure out how POSSE could work — and why it might not https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23928550/posse-posting-activitypub-standard-twitter-tumblr-mastodon" @davidpierce October 23, 2023&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;to-do: draw an updated diagram without Twitter (replace with Bluesky), and to Fediverse via BridgyFed with a line that ends in "Y" with 📤 📥 on the ends&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;update any references / instructions to POSSE to Twitter to note historical importance and current lack of automated support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;to-do: add a http://micro.blog section to the "How to" section; make sure to link to micro.blog&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why: 2024-02-24 Pluralistic: Vice surrenders &lt;p&gt;This is the moment for POSSE (Post Own Site, Share Everywhere), a strategy that sees social media as a strategy for bringing readers to channels that you control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;2024-03-09 Molly White: POSSE &lt;p&gt;I just finally deployed something I've been working on for a few weeks now: a feed of my writing, posting, reading, and other various activity that lives on my website at https://www.mollywhite.net/feed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why: to have another way to search your stuff, since sometimes (often? usually now?) large web web search engines like Google or even DDG are very poor at site-specific searching (e.g. site:http://tantek.com), whereas social media silos like Twitter are very good at profile-specific searches (e.g. from:t).&lt;/item&gt;
